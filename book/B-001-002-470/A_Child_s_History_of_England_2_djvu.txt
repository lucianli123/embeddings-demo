A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


C HAP TER XXI. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIFTH. 

FIRST PART. 

The Prince o£ Wales began bis reign like a 
generous and honest man. He set die young Earl 
of March, free;* he restored tjgpir estates and their 
honors to the Percy family, who had lost them by 
their rebellion against his father; he ordered the 
imbecile and unfortunate Richard to be honorably 
buried among the Kings of England; and he dis- 
missed all his wild companions , with assurances 
that they should not want, if they would resolve to 
be steady, faithful, and true. 

It is much easier to bum men than to bum their 
opinions; and those of the Lollards were spreading 
every day. The Lollards were represented by the 
priests — probably false for the most part — to 
entertain treasonable designs against the new King; 
•ad Henry, suffering himself to be worked upon by 
these representations* sacrificed his friend Sir John 
Oldoastle, the Lord Cobham to them, after trying 
in rain to convert Mm by arguments. He was de- 
clared guilty, as the head of the sect, and sentenced 
to the flames; but, he escaped from the Tower be-

fore the day of execution (postponed for fifty days 
by the King himself), and summoned the Lollards 
to meet him near London on a certain day. So the 
priests told the King, at least. I doubt whether 
there was any conspiracy beyond such as was got 
up by their agents. On the day appointed, instead 
of five-and-twenty thousand men, under the com- 
mand of Sir John Oldcastle, in the meadows of 
St. Giles, the King found only eighty men, and no 
Sir John at all. There was, in another place, an 
addle-headed brewer, who had gold trappings to his 
horses, and a pair of gilt spurs in his breast — ex- 
pecting to be made a knight next day by Sir John, 
and so to gain theVjght to wear them — but there 
was no Sir John, nor did anybody give any in- 
formation respecting him, though the King offered 
great rewards for such intelligence. Thirty of these 
unfortunate Lollards were hanged and drawn im- 
mediately, and were then burnt, gallows and all*, 
and the various prisons in and around London were 
crammed full of others. Some of these unfortunate 
men made various confessions of treasonable designs ; 
but, such confessions were easily got, under torture 
and the fear of fire, and are very little to be trusted. 
To finish the sad story of Sir John Oldcastle at 
once, I may mention that he escaped into Wales, 
and remained there safely, for four years. When 
discovered by Lord Powis, it is very doubtful if he 
would have been taken alive — so great was the 
old soldier’s bravery — if a miserable old woman 
had not come behind him and broken his legs with 
a stool. He was carried to London in a horse-litter,

was fastened by an iron chain to a gibbet, and se 
roasted to death. 

To make the state of France as plain as I can 
in a few words, I should tell yon that the Duke 
of Orleans, and the Duke of Burgundy, commonly 
called “John without fear,” had had a grand re- 
conciliation of their quarrel in the last reign, and 
had appeared to be in quite a heavenly state of 
mind. Immediately after which, on a Sunday, in 
the public streets of Paris, the Duke of Orleans 
was murdered by a party of twenty men, set on by 
the Duke of Burgundy — according to his own 
deliberate confession. The widow of King Richard 
had been married in France tc^he eldest son of the 
Duke of Orleans. The poor mad King was quite 
powerless to help his daughter, and the Duke of 
Burgundy became the real master of France. Isa- 
bella dying, her husband (Duke of Orleans since 
the death of his father) married the daughter of the 
Count of Armagnac, who, being a much abler man 
than his young son-in-law, headed his party; thence 
called after him Armagnacs. Thus, France was 
now in this terrible condition, that it had in it the 
party of the King’s son, the Dauphin Louis; the 
party of the Duke of Burgundy, who was the father 
of the Dauphin’s ill-used wife; and the party of the 
Armagnacs; all hating each other; all fighting to- 
gether; all composed of the most depraved nobles 
that the earth has ever known; and all tearing un- 
happy France to pieces. 

The late King had watched these dissensions 
from England, sensible (like the French people)

that no enemy of France could, injure her more 
than her own nobility. The present King now ad- 
vanced a claim to the French throne. Has demand 
being, of course, refused, he reduced his proposal 
to a certain largo amount of French territory, and 
to demanding the French princess, Catherine, in 
marriage with a fortune of two millions of golden 
crowns, lie was offered leas territory and fewer 
crowns, and no princess; but be called his ambas- 
sadors home and prepared for war. Then, he pro- 
posed to take the princess with one million of crowns. 
The French Court replied that he should have the 
prineees with two hundred thousand crowns less; 
he said this would (jpt do (he had never seen the 
princess in his life), and assembled his army at 
Southampton. There was a short plot at home just 
at that time, for deposing him, and making Ike 
Earl of March king; but, the conspirators were all 
speedily condemned and executed, and the King 
embarked for France. 

It is dreadful to observe how long a bad example 
will be followed; but, it is encouraging to know that 
a‘ good example is never thrown away. The King’s 
first act on disembarking at the mouth of the river 
Seine, three miles from Harfleur, was to imitate his 
father, and to proclaim his solemn orders that the 
Bves and property of the peaceable inhabitants 
should be respected on pain of death. It is agreed 
by French writers, to his lasting renown, that even 
while -his soldiers were suffering the greatest distress 
from want of food, these commands were rigidly 
obeyed.

HENRY THU FIFTH.

With an army in all of thirty thousand men, he 
besieged the town of Harfienr both by sea and land 
for five weeks; at the end of whieh tijne the town 
surrendered, and the inhabitants were allowed to 
depart with only five-pence each, and a part of their 
clothes. All the rest of their possessions was divided 
amongst the English army. But, that army suf- 
fered so much, in spite of its successes, from disease 
and privation, that it was already reduced 6ne half. 
Stall, the King was determined not to retire until 
he had struck a greater blow. Therefore, against 
the advice of his counsellors, he moved on with his 
little force towards Calais. When he came up to 
the river Somme he was un a^le to cross, in con- 
sequence of the ford being fortified; and, as the 
English moved up the left bank of the river looking 
for a crossing, the French , who had broken all the 
bridges, moved up the right bank, watching them, 
and waiting to attack them when they should try 
to pass it. At last the English found a crossing 
and got safely over. The French held a council 
of war at Bouen, resolved to give the English battle, 
and sent heralds to King Henry to know by which 
road he was going. “By the road that will take 
me straight to Calais ! ” said the King, and sent 
them away with a present of a hundred crowns. 

The English moved on, until they beheld the 
Freneh, and then the King gave orders to form in 
line of battle. The French not coming on, the army 
broke op after remaining in battle array till night, 
and got good rest and refreshment at a neighbouring 
village. The French were now all lying in another

village, through which they knew the English must 
pass. They were resolved that the English should 
begin the battle. The English had no means of 
retreat, if their King had had any such intention; 
and so the two armies passed the night, elose to- 
gether. 

To understand these armies well, you must bear 
in mind that the immense French army had, among 
its notable persons, almost the whole of that wicked 
nobility, whose debauchery had made France a de- 
sert; and so besotted were they by pride, and by 
contempt for the common people, that they had 
scarcely any bowmen (if indeed they had any at 
all) in their whole enormous number: which, com- 
pared with the English army, was at least as six 
to one. For these proud fools had said that the 
bow was not a fit weapon for knightly hands, and 
that France must be defended by gentlemen only. 
We shall see, presently, what hand the gentlemen 
made of it 

Now, on the English side, among the little force, 
there was a good proportion of men who were not 
gentlemen by any means, but who were good stout 
archers for all that. Among them, in the morning 
— having slept little at night, while the French 
were carousing and making sure of victory — - the 
King rode, on a grey horse; wearing on his head 
a helmet of shining steel, surmounted by a crown 
of gold, sparkling with precious stones ; and bearing 
over his armor, embroidered together, the arms of 
England and the arms of France. The archers 
looked at the shining helmet and the crown of gold

and the sparkling jewels, and admired them all; 
bat, what they admired most was the Song's cheer- 
ful face, and his bright blue eye, as he told them 
that, for himself, he had made up his mind to con- 
quer there or to die there, and that England should 
never have a ransom to pay for Am. There was 
one brave knight who chanced to say that he wished 
some of the many gallant gentlemen and good 
soldiers, who were then idle at home in England, 
were there to increase their numbers. But the King 
told him that, for his part, he did not wish for one 
more man. u The fewer we have,” said he, “the 
greater will be the honor we shall win I” His men, 
being now all in good hearty were refreshed with 
bread and wine, and heard prayers, and waited 
quietly for the French. The King waited for the 
French, because they were drawn up thirty deep 
(the little English force was only three deep) on 
very difficult and heavy ground; and he knew that 
when they moved, there must be confusion among 
them. 

As they did not move, he sent off two parties: 
— one, to lie concealed in a wood on the left of 
the French: the other, to set fire to some houses 
behind the French after the battle should be begun. 
This was scarcely done, when three of the proud 
French gentlemen, who were to defend their coun- 
try without any help from the base peasants, came 
riding out, calling upon the English to surrender. 
TheKing warned those gentlemen himself to retire 
with all speed if they cared for their lives, and 
ordered the English banners to advance. Upon

that, Sir Thomas Erpingh&m, a great English 
general, who commanded the archers, threw his 
truncheon into the air, joyfully; and all the English 
men, kneeling down upon the ground and biting 
it as if they took possession of the country, rose 
up with a great shout and fell Upon the French. 

Every archer was furnished with a great stake 
tipped with iron; and his orders were, to thrust this 
stake into the ground, to discharge his arrow, and 
then to fall back, when the French horsemen came 
on. As the haughty French gentlemen, who were 
to break die English archers and utterly destroy 
them with their knightly lances, came "riding up, 
they were received %dth such a blinding storm of 
arrows, that they broke and turned. Horses and 
men rolled over one another, and the confusion 
was terrific. Those who rallied and charged the 
archers got among the stakes on slippery andboggy 
ground, and were so bewildered that the English 
archers — who wore no armor and even took off 
their leathern coats to be more active — cut them 
to pieees, root and branch. Only three French 
horsemen got within the stakes, and those were in- 
stantly despatched. AH this time the dense French 
army, being in armor, were sinking knee-deep into 
the mire; while the light English archers, half- 
naked, were as fresh and active as if they were 
fighting on a marble floor. 

But now, the second division of the French 
coming to the relief of the first, closed up in a firm 
mass; the English, headed by the King, attacked 
thorn; and the deadliest part of the battle began.

HSHUY THE FIFTH.

The King’s brother, the Duke of Clarence, was 
struck down, and numbers of the French surrounded 
him; but, King Henry, standing over the body, 
fought like a lion until they were beaten off. 

Presently, came up a band of eighteen French 
knights, bearing the banner of a certain French 
lord, who had sworn to kill or take the English 
King. One of them struck him such a blow with 
a battle-axe that he reeled and fell upon his knees: 
but, his faithful men, immediately closing round 
him, killed every one of those eighteen knights, 
and so that French lord never kept his oath. 

The French Duke of Alen^on, seeing this, made 
a desperate charge, and cut his way close up to 
the Royal Standard of England. He beat down 
the Duke of York, who was standing near it; and, 
when the King came to his rescue, struck off a 
piece of the crown he wore. But, he never struck 
another blow in this world; for, even as he was in 
the act of saying who he was, and that he sur- 
rendered to the King; and even as the King 
stretched ont his hand to give him a safe and ho- 
norable acceptance of the offer; he fell dead, pierced 
by innumerable wounds. 

.The death of this nobleman decided the battle. 
The third division of the French army, which had 
never struck a blow yet, and which was, in itself, 
more than double the whole English power, broke 
and fled. At this time of the light, the English, 
who as yet had made no prisoners, began to take 
them in immense numbers, and were still occupied 
in doing so, or in hiding those who would not sur-

render, when a great noise arose in the rear of the 
French — their flying banners were seen to stop 
— and King Henry, supposing a great reinforce- 
ment to have arrived, gave orders that all the pri- 
soners should be put to death. As soon, however, 
as it was found that the noise was only occasioned 
by a body of plundering peasants, the terrible 
massacre was stopped. 

Then King Henry called to him the French 
herald, and asked him to whom the victory be- 
longed. 

The herald replied, “To the King of England.” 

“We have not made this havoc and slaughter,” 
said the King, “it is the wrath of Heaven on the 
sins of France. What is the name of that castle 
yonder?” 

The herald answered him, “My lord, it is the 
castle of Azincourt." 

Said the King, “From henceforth this battle 
shall be known to posterity, by the name of the 
battle of Azincourt.” 

Our English historians have made it Agineourt; 
but, under that name, it will ever be famous in 
English annals. 

The loss upon the French side was enormous. 
Three Dukes were killed, two more were taken 
prisoners, seven Counts were killed, three more 
were taken prisoners, and ten thousand knights and 
gentlemen were slain upon the held. The English 
loss amounted to sixteen hundred men, among whom 
were the Duke of York and the Earl of Suffolk. 

War is a dreadful thing; and it is appalling to

know haw the English were obliged, next morning, 
to hill those prisoners mortally wounded, who yet 
writhed in agony upon the ground; how the dead 
upon the French side were stripped by their own 
countrymen and countrywomen, and afterwards 
buried in great pits; how the dead upon the English 
ride were piled up in a great bam, and how their 
bodies and the barn were all burned together. It 
is in such things, and in many more much too 
horrible to relate, that the real desolation and 
wickedness of war consist. Nothing can make 
war otherwise than horrible. But the dark side of 
it was little thought of and soon forgotten; and it 
cast no shade of trouble on the English people, 
except on those who had lost friends or relations 
m the fight. They welcomed their King home with 
riiouts of rejoicing, and plunged into the water to 
bear him ashore on their shoulders, and flocked out 
to crowds to welcome him in every town through 
^hich he passed, and hung rich carpets and ta- 
pestries out of the windows, and strewed the streets 
flowers, and made the fountains run with wine, 
as the great field of Agincourt had run with blood. 


SECOND PART. 

That proud and wicked French nobility who 
lagged their country to destruction, and who 
*ere every day and every year regarded with deeper 
hatred and detestation in the hearts of the French 
People, learnt nothing, even from the defeat of 
Agfocourt. So far from uniting against the eom-

mon enemy, they became, among themselves, more 
violent, more bloody, and more false — if that 
were possible — than they had been before. The 
Count of Armagnac persuaded the French king to 
plunder of her treasures Queen Isabella of Bavaria, 
and to make her a prisoner. She, who had hitherto 
been the bitter enemy of the Duke of Burgundy, 
proposed to join him, in revenge. He attacked her 
guards and carried her off to Troyes, where she 
proclaimed herself Regent of France, and made him 
her lieutenant. The Armagnac party were at that 
time possessed of Paris; but, one of the gates of 
the city being secretly opened on a certain night 
to a party of the duke’s men, they got into Park, 
threw into the prisons all the Armagnacs upon 
whom they could lay their hands, and, a few nights 
afterwards, with the aid of a furious mob of sixty 
thousand people, broke the prisons open, and killed 
them all. The former Dauphin was now dead, and 
the king’s third son bore the title. Him, in the 
height of this murderous scene, a French knight 
hurried out of bed, wrapt in a sheet, and bore away 
to Poitiers. So, when the revengeful Isabella and 
the Duke of Burgundy entered Paris in triumph 
after the slaughter of their enemies, the Dauphin 
was proclaimed at Poitiers as the real Regent. 

King Henry had not been idle since his victory 
of Agincourt, but had repulsed a brave attempt of 
the French to recover Harfleur; had gradually con- 
quered a great part of Normandy; and, at this 
crisis of affairs, took the important town of Rouen,

alarmed the French) that the Duke of Burgundy 
proposed that a meeting to treat of peace should 
be held between the French and the English kings 
in a plain by the river Seine. On the appointed 
day, King Henry appeared there, with his two 
brothers, Clarence and Gloucester, and a thousand 
men. The unfortunate French King, being more 
mad than usual that day, could not come; but, the 
Queen came, and with her the Princess Catherine: 
who was a very lovely creature, and who made a 
real impression on King Henry, now that he saw 
her fbr the first time. This was the most important 
circumstance that arose out of the meeting. 

Ab if it were impossible for a French nobleman 
of that time to be true to his word of honor in 
anything, Henry discovered that the Duke of Bur- 
gundy was, at that very moment, in secret treaty 
with the Dauphin; and he therefore abandoned the 
negociation. 

The Duke of .Burgundy and the Dauphin, each 
of whom with the best reason distrusted the other 
as a noble ruffian surrounded by a party of a noble 
ruffians, were rather at a loss how to proceed after 
this; hut, at length they agreed to meet, on a 
bridge over the river Tonne, where it was arranged 
that there should be two strong gates put up, with 
an empty space between them; and that the Duke 
of Burgundy should come into that space by one 
gate, with ten men only; and that the Dauphin 
should come into that space by the other gate, also 
with ten men, and no more. 

So far the Dauphin kept his word, but no far-

ther. When the Duke of Burgundy was on his 
knee before him in the act of speaking, one of the 
Dauphin’s noble ruffians cut the said duke down 
with a small axe, and others speedily finished binu 

It was in vain for the Dauphin to pretend that 
this base murder was not done with his consent; it 
was too bad, even for France, and caused a general 
horror. The duke’s heir hastened to make a treaty 
with King Henry, and the French Queen engaged 
that her husband should consent to it, whatever it 
was. Henry made peace, on condition of receiving 
the Princess Catherine in marriage, and being made 
Regent of France during the rest of the King’s life- 
time, and succeeding .to the French crown at his 
death. He was soon married to the beautiful Prin- 
cess, and took her proudly home to England, where 
she was crowned with great honor and glory. 

This peace was called the Perpetual Peace; we 
shall soon see how long it lasted. It gave great 
satisfaction to the French people, although they 
were so poor and miserable, that, at the time of 
the celebration of the Royal marriage, numbers of 
them were dying with starvation, on the dunghills 
in the streets of Paris. There was some resistance, 
on the part of the Dauphin in some few parts of 
France, but King Henry beat it all down. 

And now, with his great possessions in Franco 
secured, and his beautiful wife to cheer him, and a 
son bom to give him greater happiness, all ap- 
peared bright before him. But, in the fulness of 
his triumph and the height of his power, Death 
came upon him, and his day was done. When he

fell ill at Vincennes , and found that he could not 
recover, he was very calm and quiet, and spoke 
serenely to those who wept around his bed. His 
wife and child, he said, he left to the loving care 
of his brother the Duke of Bedford, and his other 
faithful nobles. He gave them his advice that 
England should establish a friendship with the new 
Duke of Burgundy , and offer him the regency of 
France; that it should not set free the royal prin- 
ces who had been taken at Agincourt; and that, 
whatever quarrel might arise with France, England 
should never make peace without holding -Nor- 
mandy. Then, he laid down his head, and asked 
the attendant priests to chant the penitential psalms. 
Amid which solemn sounds, on the thirty-first of 
August, one thousand four hundred and twenty- 
two, in only the thirty-fourth year of his age and 
the tenth of his reign, King Henry the Fifth passed 
away. 

Slowly and mournfully they carried his em- 
balmed body in a procession of great state to Paris, 
and thence to Rouen where his Queen was: from 
whom the sad intelligence of his death was con- 
cealed until he had been dead some days. Thence, 
lying on a bed of crimson and gold, with a golden 
crown upon the head, and a golden ball and sceptre 
lying in the nerveless hands, they carried it to 
Calais, with such a great retinue as seemed to dye 
the road black. The King of Scotland acted as 
chief mourner, all the Royal Household' followed, 
the knights wore black armour and black plumes 
of feathers, crowds of men bore torches, making

the night as light as day; and the widowed Prin- 
cess followed last of all. At Calais there was a 
fleet of ships to bring the funeral host to Dover, 
and so, by way of London Bridge, where the ser- 
vice for the dead was chanted as it passed ajong, 
they brought the body to Westminster Abbey, and 
there buried it with great respect. 


CHAPTER XXXI. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SIXTH. 

PART THE FIRST. 

It had been the wish of the late King, that 
while his infant son King Henry the Sixth, at 
this time only nine months old, was under age, Hie 
Duke of Gloucester should be appointed Regent. 
The English Parliament, however, preferred to ap- 
point a Council of Regency, with the Duke of Bed- 
ford at its head: to be represented, in his absence 
only, by the Duke of Gloucester. The Parliament 
would seem to have been wise in this, for Glou- 
cester soon showed himself to be ambitious and 
troublesome, and, in the gratification of his own 
personal schemes, gave dangerous offence to the 
Duke of Burgundy, which was with difficulty ad- 
justed. 

As that duke declined the Regency of France, 
it was bestowed by the poor French Kin g upon the 
Duke of Bedford. But, the French Bong dying 
within two months, the Dauphin instantly asserted

his claim to the French throne, and was actually 
crowned under the title of Charles the Seventh. 
The Duke of Bedford, to be a match for him, 
entered into a friendly league with the Dukes of 
Burgundy and Brittany, and gave them his two 
sisters in marriage. War with France was imme- 
diately renewed, and the Perpetual Peace came to 
an untimely end. 

In the first campaign, the English, aided by 
this alliance, were speedily successful. As Scot- 
land, however, had sent the French five thousand 
men, and might send more, or attack the North of 
England while England was busy with France, it 
was considered that it would be a good thing to 
offer the Scottish King, James, who had been so 
long imprisoned, his liberty, on his paying forty 
thousand pounds for his board and lodging during 
nineteen years, and engaging to forbid his subjects 
from serving under the flag of France. It is plea- 
sant to know, not only that the amiable captive at 
last regained his freedom upon these terms, but, 
that he married a noble English lady with whom 
he had been long in love, and became an excellent 
King. I am afraid we have met with some Kings 
in this history, and shall meet with some more, 
who would have been very much the better, and 
would have left the world much happier, if they 
had been imprisoned nineteen years too. 

In the second campaign, the English gained a 
considerable victory at Vemeuil, in a battle which 
was chiefly remarkable, otherwise, for their resorting 
to the odd expedient of tying their baggage-horses

together by the heads and tails, and jumbling them 
up with the baggage, so as to convert them into a 
sort of live fortification — which was found useful 
to the troops, but which I should think was not 
agreeable to the horses. For three years afterwards 
very little was done, owing to both sides being too 
poor for war, which is a very expensive entertain- 
ment; but, a council was then held in Paris, in 
which it was decided to lay siege to the town of 
Orleans, which was a place of great importance to 
the ■ Dauphin’s cause. An English army of ten 
thousand men was dispatched on this service, under 
the command of the Earl of Salisbury, a general 
of fame. He being unfortunately killed early in 
the siege, the Earl of Suffolk took his place; under 
whom (reinforced by Sir John Falstaff, who 
brought up four hundred waggons laden with salt 
herrings and other provisions for the troops, and, 
beating off the French who tried to intercept him, 
came victorious out of a hot skirmish, which was 
afterwards called in jest the Battle of the Herrings), 
the town of Orleans was so completely hemmed in, 
that the besieged proposed to yield it up to their 
countryman the Duke of Burgundy. The English 
general, however, replied that his English men had 
won it, so far, by ‘their blood and valor, and that 
his English men must have it. There seemed to 
be no hope for the town, or for the Dauphin, who 
was so dismayed that he even thought of flying to 
Scotland or to Spain — when a peasant girl rose 
up and changed the whole state of affairs.

The story of this peasant girl I have now 
to tell. 


PABT THE SECOND. 

THE STORY OF JOAN OF ABC. 

In a remote village among some wild hills in 
the province of Lorraine, there lived a countryman 
whose name was Jacques d’Arc. He had a 
daughter, Joan of Arc, who was at this time in 
her twentieth year. She had been a solitary girl 
from her childhood; slie had often tended sheep 
and cattle for whole days where no human figure 
was seen or human voice heard; and she had often 
knelt, for hours together, in the gloomy empty little 
village chapel, looking up at the altar and at the 
dim lamp burning before it, until she fancied that 
she saw shadowy figures standing there, and even 
that she heard them speak to her. The people in 
that part of France were very ignorant and super- 
stitious, and they had many ghostly tales to tell 
about what they dreamed, and what they saw among 
the lonely hills when the clouds and the mists were 
resting on them. So, they easily believed that 
Joan saw strange sights, and they whispered among 
themselves that angels and spirits talked to her. 

At last, Joan told her father that she had one 
day been surprised by a great unearthly light, and 
had afterwards heard a solemn voice, which said it 
was Saint Michael's voice, telling her that she was 
to go and help the Dauphin. Soon after this (she 
said), Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret had ap- 
peared to her, with sparkling crowns upon their

heads, and had encouraged her to be virtuous and 
resolute. These visions had returned sometimes; 
but the Voices very often; and the voices always 
said, “Joan, thou art appointed by Heaven to go 
and help the Dauphin!” She almost always heard 
them while the .chapel bells were ringing. 

There is no doubt, now, that J oan believed she 
saw and heard these things. It is very well known 
that such delusions are a disease which is not by 
any means uncommon. It is probable enough that 
there were figures of Saint Michael, and Saint Ca- 
therine, and Saint Margaret, in the little chapel 
(where they would be very likely to have shining 
crowns upon their heads) , and that they first gave 
Joan the idea of those three personages. She had 
long been a moping, fanciful girl, and, though she 
was a yery good girl, I dare say she was a little 
vain, and wishful for notoriety. 

Her father, something wiser than his neighbours, 
said, “I tell thee, Joan, it is thy fancy. Thou 
hadst better have a kind husband to take care of 
thee, girl, and work to employ thy mind!” , But 
Joan told him in reply, that she had taken a vow 
never to have a husband, and that she must go as 
Heaven directed her, to help the Dauphin. 

It happened, unfortunately for her father’s per- 
suasions, and most unfortunately for the poor girl, 
too, that a party of the Dauphin’s enemies found 
their way into the village while Joan’s disorder 
was at this point, and burnt the chapel, and drove 
out the inhabitants. The cruelties she saw com- 
mitted , touched J oan’s heart and made her worse.

She said that the voices and the figures were now 
continually with her; that they told her she was 
the girl who, according to an old prophecy, was to 
deliver France; that she must go and help the 
Dauphin, and must remain with him until he should 
be crowned at Eheims: and that she must travel a 
long way to a certain lord named Baudricourt, 
who could and would, bring her into the Dauphin’s 
presence. 

As her father still said, U I tell thee, Joan, it is 
thy fancy,” she set off to find out this lord, accom- 
panied by an uncle, a poor village wheelwright 
and cart-maker, who believed in the reality of her 
visions. They travelled a long way and went on 
and on, over a rough country, full of the Duke of 
Burgundy’s men, and of all kinds of robbers and 
marauders, until they came to where this lord was. 

When his servants told him that there was a 
poor peasant girl named Joan of Arc, accompanied 
by nobody but. an old village wheelwright and 
cart-maker, who wished to see him because she 
was commanded to help the Dauphin and save 
France, Baudricourt burst out a-laughing, and bade 
them send the girl away. But, he soon heard so 
much about her lingering in the town, and praying 
in the churches, and seeing visions, and doing 
harm to no one, that he sent for her, and questioned 
her. As she said the same things after she had 
been well sprinkled with holy water as she had 
said before the sprinkling, Baudricourt began to 
think there might be something in it. At all events, 
he thought it worth while to send her on to the

town of Chinon, where the Dauphin was. So, he 
bought her a horse, and a sword, and gave her 
two squires to conduct her. As the Voices had 
told Joan that she was to wear a man’s dress, now, 
she put one on, and girded her sword to her side, 
and bound spurs to her heels, and mounted her 
horse and rode away with her two squires. As to 
her uncle the wheelwright, he stood staring at his 
niece in wonder until she was out of sight — as 
well he might — and then went home again. The 
best place, too. 

Joan and her two squires rode on and on, until 
they came to Chinon, where she was, after some 
doubt, admitted into the Dauphin’s presence. Picking 
him out immediately from all his court, she told 
him that she came commanded by Heaven to sub- 
due his enemies and conduct him to his coronation 
at Rheims. She also told him (or he pretended so 
afterwards to make the greater impression upon 
his soldiers) a number of his secrets known only 
to himself, and, furthermore, she said there was an 
old, old sword in the cathedral of Saint Catherine 
at Fierbois, marked with five old crosses on the 
blade, which Saint Catherine had ordered her to 
wear. 

Now, nobody knew anything about this old, 
old sword, but when the cathedral came to be 
examined — which was immediately done — there, 
sure enough , the sword was found! The Dauphin 
then required a number of grave priests and bi- 
shops to give him their opinion whether the girl 
derived her power from good spirits or from evil

spirits, which they held prodigiously long debates 
about, in the course of which several learned men 
fell fast asleep and snored loudly. At last, when 
one gruff old gentleman had said to Joan, “What 
language do your Voices speak?” and when Joan 
had replied to the gruff old gentleman “A plea- 
santer language than yours,” they agreed that it 
was all correct, and that Joan of Arc was inspired 
from Heaven. This wonderful circumstance put 
new heart into the Dauphin’s soldiers when they 
heard of it, and dispirited the English army, who 
took Joan for a witch. 

So Joan mounted horse again, and again rode 
on and on, until she came to Orleans. But she 
rode now, as never peasant girl had ridden yet 
She rode upon a white war-horse, in suit of glit- 
tering armour; with the old, old sword from the 
cathedral, newly burnished, in her belt; with a 
white flag carried before her, upon which were a 
picture of God, and the words Jesus Mabia. In 
this splendid state, at the head of a great body of 
troops escorting provisions of all kinds for the 
starving inhabitants of Orleans, she appeared before 
that beleaguered city. 

When the people on the walls beheld her, they 
cried out “The Maid is come! The Maid of the 
Prophecy is come to deliver us!” And this, and 
the sight of the Maid fighting at the head of their 
men, made the French so bold, and made the 
English so fearful, that the English line of forts 
were soon broken, the troops and provisions were 
got into the town, and Orleans was saved.

24 A child’s HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 

Joan, henceforth called The Maid of Orleans, 
remained within the walls for a few days, and 
caused letters to be thrown over, ordering Lord 
Suffolk and his Englishmen to depart from before 
the town according to the will of Heaven. As the 
English general very positively declined to believe 
that Joan knew anything about the will of Heaven 
(which did not mend the matter with his soldiers, 
for they stupidly said if she were not inspired she 
was a witch, and it was of no use to fight against 
a witch), she mounted her white war-horse again, 
and ordered her white banner to advance. 

The besiegers held the bridge, and some strong 
towers upon the bridge; and here the Maid of Or- 
leans attacked them. The fight was fourteen hours 
long. She planted a scaling ladder with her own 
hands, and mounted a tower wall, but was struck 
by an English arrow in the neck, and fell into the 
trench. She was carried away and the arrow was 
taken out, during which operation she screamed 
and cried with the pain, as any other girl might 
have done; but presently she said that the Voices 
were speaking to her and soothing her to rest. 
After a while, she got up, and was again foremost 
In the fight. When the English who had seen her 
fall and supposed her to be dead, saw this, they 
were troubled with the strangest fears, and some 
of them cried out that they beheld St. Michael on 
a white horse (probably Joan herself) fighting for 
the French. They lost the bridge, and lost the 
towers, and next day set their chain of forts on 
fire, and left the place.

But as Lord Suffolk himself retired no farther 
than the town of Jargeau, which was only a few 
miles off, the Maid of Orleans besieged him there, 
and he was taken prisoner. As the white banner 
scaled the wall, she was struck upon the head with 
a stone', and was again tumbled down into the 
ditch; but, she only cried all the more, as she lay 
there, u On, on, my countrymen ! And fear nothing, 
for the Lord hath delivered them into our hands ! ” 
After this new success of the Maid’s, several other 
fortresses and places which had previously held 
out against the Dauphin were delivered up without 
a battle; and at Patay she defeated the remainder 
of the English army, and set up her victorious 
white banner on a field where twelve hundred 
Englishmen lay dead. 

She now urged the Dauphin (who always kept 
out of the way when there was any fighting) to 
proceed to Rheims, as the first part of her mission 
was accomplished; and to complete the whole by 
being crowned there. The Dauphin was in no 
particular hurry to do this, as Rheims was a long 
way off, arid the English and the Duke of Burgundy 
were still strong in the country through which the 
road lay. However, they set forth, with ten thou- 
sand men, and again the Maid of Orleans rode on 
and on, upon her white , war-horse, and in her 
shining armour. Whenever they came to a town 
which yielded readily, the soldiers believed in her; 
but, whenever they came to a town which gave 
them any trouble, they began to murmur that she 
was an impostor. The latter was particularly the

case at Troyes, which finally yielded, however, 
through the persuasion of one Bichard, a friar of 
the place. Friar Bichard was in the old doubt 
about the Maid of Orleans, until he had sprinkled 
her well with holy water, and had also well sprinkled 
the threshold of the gate by which she came into 
the city. Finding that it made no change in her 
or the gate, he said, as the other grave old gentle- 
men had said, that it was all right, and became 
her great ally. 

So, at last, by dint of riding on and on, the 
Maid of Orleans, and the Dauphin, and the ten 
thousand sometimes believing and sometimes unbe- 
lieving men, came to Bheims. And in the great 
cathedral of Bheims, the Dauphin actually was 
crowned Charles the Seventh in a great assembly 
of the people. Then, the Maid, who with her white 
banner stood beside the Ring in that hour of his 
triumph, kneeled down upon the pavement at his 
feet, and said, with tears, that what she had been 
inspired to do, was done, and that the only recom- 
pense she asked for, was, that she should now 
have leave to go back to her distant home, and 
her sturdily incredulous father, and her first simple 
escort the village wheelwright and cart-maker. But 
the Bang said “No!” and made her and her family 
as noble as a Bang could, and settled upon her the 
income of a Count. 

Ah! happy had it been for the Maid of Orleans, 
if she had resumed her rustic dress that day, and 
had gone home to the little chapel and the wild 
hills , and had forgotten all these things , and had

been a good man's wife, and had heard no stranger 
voices than the voices of little children! 

It was not to be, and she continued helping 
the King (she did a world for him, in alliance with 
Friar Richard) , and trying to improve the lives of 
tbe coarse soldiers, and leading a religious, an 
unselfish , and a modest life, herself, beyond any 
doubt. Still, many times she prayed the King to 
let her go home; and once she even took off her 
bright armour and hung it up in a church, meaning 
never to wear it more. But, the King always won 
ber back again — while she was of any use to 
him — and so she went on and on and on, to her 
doom. 

When the Duke of Bedford, who was a very 
able man, began to be active for England, and, by 
bringing the war back into France and by holding 
the Duke of Burgundy to his faith, to distress and 
disturb Charles very much, Charles sometimes asked 
tbe Maid of Orleans what the Voices said about it? 
But, the Voices had become (very like ordinary 
voices in perplexed times,) contradictory and con- 
ned, so that now they said one thing, and now 
8a id another, and the Maid lost credit every day. 
Charles marched on Paris, which was opposed to 
bbn, and attacked the suburb of Saint Honord. In 
fight, being again struck down into the ditch, 
fi be was abandoned by the whole army. She lay 
unaided among a heap of dead, and crawled out 
bow she could. Then , some of her believers went 
°ver to an opposition Maid, Catherine of La Ro- 
c hell© , who said she was inspired to tell where

there were treasures of buried money — though 
she never did — and then Joan accidentally broke 
the old, old sword, and others said that her power 
was broken with it. Finally, at the siege of Com- 
pi&gne, held by the Duke of Burgundy, where she 
did valiant service, she was basely left alone in a 
retreat, though facing about and fighting to the 
last; and an archer pulled her off her horse. 

0 the uproar that was made, and the thanks- 
givings that were sung, about the capture of this 
one poor country-girl! O the way in which she 
was demanded to be tried for sorcery and heresy, 
and anything else you like, by the Inquisitor-Ge- 
neral of France, and by this great man, and by 
that great man, until it is wearisome to think of! 
She was bought at last by the Bishop of Beauvais 
for ten thousand francs,, and was shut up in her 
narrow prison: plain Joan of Arc again, and Maid 
of Orleans no more. 

1 should never have done if I were to tell you 
how they had Joan out to examine her, and cross- 
examine her, and re-examine her, and worry her 
into saying anything aud everything; and how all 
sorts of scholars and doctors bestowed their utmost 
tediousness upon her. Sixteen times she was brought 
out and shut up again, and worried, and entrapped, 
and argued with, until she was heart-sick of the 
dreary business. On the last occasion of this kind 
she was brought into a burial-place at Bouen, dis- 
mally decorated with a scaffold, and a stake and 
faggots., and the executioner, and a pulpit with a 
friar therein, and an awful sermon ready. It is

very affecting to know that even at that pass the 
poor girl honored the mean vermin of a King, who 
had so used her for his purposes and so abandoned 
her; and, that while she had been regardless of 
reproaches heaped upon herself, she spoke out 
courageously for him. 

It was natural in one so young to hold to life. 
To save her life, she signed a declaration prepared 
for her — signed it with a cross, for she couldn’t 
write — that all her visions and Voices had come 
from the Devil. Upon her recanting the past, and 
protesting that she would never wear a man’s dress 
in future, she was condemned to imprisonment for 
hfe, “on the bread of sorrow and the water of af- 
fliction.” 

But, on the bread of sorrow and the water of 
affliction, the visions and the Voices soon returned. 
It was quite natural that they should do so , for 
that kind of disease is much aggravated by fasting, 
loneliness, and anxiety of mind. It was not only 
got out of Joan that she considered herself inspired 
again, but, she was taken in a man’s dress, which 
had been left — to entrap her — in her prison, 
and which she put on, in her solitude;. perhaps, in 
remembrance of her past glories; perhaps, because 
the imaginary Voices told her. For this relapse 
into the soreery and heresy and anything else you 
like, she was sentenced to be burnt to death. And, 
in the market-place of Rouen, in the hideous dress 
which the monks had invented for such spectacles; 
with priests and bishops sitting in a gallery looking 
on, though some had the Christian grace to go

away, unable to endure the infamous scene; this 
shrieking girl — last seen amidst the smoke and 
fire, holding a crucifix between her hands; last 
heard, calling upon Christ — was burnt to ashes. 
They threw her ashes into the river Seine; but, j 
they will rise against her murderers on the last day. | 

From the moment of her capture, neither the j 
French King nor one single man in all his court j 
raised a finger to save her. It is no defence of i 
them that they may have never really believed in 
her, or that they may have won her victories by j 
their skill and bravery. The more they pretended 
to believe in her, the more they had caused her to 
believe in herself; and she had ever been true to 
them, ever brave, ever nobly devoted. But, it is 
no wonder, that they, who were in all things false 
to themselves, false to one another, false to their 
country, false to Heaven, and false to Earth, should 
be monsters of ingratitude and treachery to a help- 
less peasant girl. 

In the picturesque old town of Rouen, where 
weeds and grass grow high on the cathedral towers, 
and the venerable Norman streets are still warm 
in the blessed sunlight though the monkish fires 
that once gleamed horribly upon them have long 
. grown cold, there is a statue of Joan of Arc, in 
the scene of her last agony, the square to which 
she has given its present name. I know some j 
statues of modem times — even in the World’s 
metropolis, I think — which commemorate less 
constancy, less earnestness, smaller claims upon 
the world’s attention, and much greater impostors.

PART THE THIRD. 

Bad deeds seldom prosper, happily for man* 
hind; and the English cause gained no advantage 
from the cruel death of Joan of Arc. For a long 
time, the war went heavily on. The Duke of Bed- 
ford died; the alliance with the Duke of Burgundy 
was broken; and Lord Talbot became a great ge- 
neral on the English side in France. But, two of 
the consequences of wars are, Famine — because 
the people cannot peacefully cultivate the ground 
— and Pestilence, which comes of want, misery, 
and suffering. Both these horrors broke out in 
both countries, and lasted for two wretched years. 
Then, the war went on again, and came by slow 
degrees to be so badly conducted by the English 
government, that, within twenty years from the 
execution of the Maid of Orleans, of all the great 
Trench conquests, the town of Calais alone re- 
gained in English hands. 

While these victories and defeats were taking 
place in the course of time, many strange things 
happened at home. The young King, as he grew 
u Pi proved to be very unlike his great father, and 
showed himself a miserable puny creature. There 
was no harm in him — he had a great aversion 
to shedding blood: which was something — but, 
ho was a weak, silly, helpless young man, and a 
mere shuttlecock to the great lordly battledores 
about the Court. 

Of these battledores, Cardinal Beaufort a rela- 
of the King, and the Duke of Gloucester, were

at first the most powerful. The Duke of Gloucester 
had a wife, who was nonsensically accused of 
practising witchcraft to cause the King’s death and 
lead to her husband’s coming to the throne, he 
being the next heir. She was charged with having, 
by the help of a ridiculous old woman named 
Margery (wo was called a witch), made a little 
waxen doll in the King’s likeness, and put it before 
a slow fire that it might gradually melt away. It 
was supposed, in such cases, that the death of the 
person whom the doll was made to represent, was 
sure to happen. Whether the duchess was as igno- 
rant as the rest of them, and really did make such 
a doll with such an intention, I don’t know, but, 
you and I know very well that she might have 
made a thousand dolls, if she had been stupid 
enough, and might have melted them all, without 
hurting the King or anybody else. However, she 
was tried for it, and so was old Margery, and so 
was one of the duke’s chaplains, who was charged 
with having assisted them. Both he and Margery 
were put to death, and the duchess, after being 
taken, on foot and bearing a lighted candle, three 
times round the City as a penance, was imprisoned 
for life. The duke, himself, took all this pretty 
quietly, and made as little stir about the matter 
as if he were rather glad to be rid of the duchess. 

But, he was not destined to keep himself out 
of trouble long. The royal shuttlecock being three- 
and-twenty, the battledores were very anxious to 
get him married. The Duke of Gloucester wanted 
him to marry a daughter of the Count of Ar-

raagnac; but, the Cardins! and the Earl of Suffolk 
▼ere all for Margaret, the daughter of the King 
of Sicily, who they knew was a resolute ambitious 
woman and would govern the King as she chose. 
To make friends with this lady, the Earl of Suf- 
folk, who went over to arrange the match, con- 
sented to accept her for the King’s wife without 
any fortune, and even to give up the two most 
valuable possessions England then had in France. 
So, the marriage was arranged, on terms very ad- 
vantageous to the lady; and Lord Suffolk brought 
her to England, and she was married at West* 
minster. On what pretence this queen and her 
party charged the Duke of Gloucester with high 
treason within a couple of years, it is impossible 
to make out, the matter is so confused; but, they 
pretended that the King’s life was in danger, and 
they took the duke prisoner. A fortnight after- 
wards, be was found dead in bed (they said), and 
his body was shown to the people, and Lord Suf- 
folk came in for the best part of his estates. Tou 
know by this time bow strangely liable state pri- 
soners were to sudden death. 

If Cardinal Beaufort had any hand in this mat- 
ter, it did him no good, for he died within six 
weeks; thinking it very hard and curious — at 
eighty years old! — that he could not five to be 
Pope. 

This was the time when England had completed 
her loss of all her great French conquests. The 
people charged the loss principally upon the Earl 
of Suffolk, now a duke, who had made those easy

charges, but chiefly on accusations of having aided

the people being violent against him, the King 
was made (by his Mends) to interpose to save him, 
by banishing him for five years, and proroguing 
the Parliament The duke had much ado to escape 
from a London mob, two thousand strong, who lay 
in wait for him in St. Giles's fields; but, he got 
down to his own estates in Suffolk, and sailed 
away from Ipswich. Sailing across the Channel, 
he sent into Calais to know if he might land there ; 
but, they kept his boat and men in the harbor, 
until an English ship, carrying a hundred and fifty 
men and called the Nicholas of the Tower, came 
alongside his little vessel, and ordered him on 
board. u Welcome, traitor, as men say,” was the 
captain's grim and not very respectful salutation. 
He was kept on board, a prisoner, for eight-and- 
forty hours, and then a small boat appeared rowing 
towards the ship. As this boat came nearer, it 
was seen to have in it a block, a rusty sword, and 
an executioner in a black mask. The duke was 
handed down into it, and there his head was cut 
off with six strokes of the rusty sword. Then, the 
little boat rowed away to Dover beach, where the 
body was cast eutr, and left until the duchess 
claimed it. By whom, high in authority, this

murder was committed , has never appeared. No 
one was ever punished for it 

There now arose in Kent an Irishman, who 
gave himself the name of Mortimer, but whose real 
name was Jack Cade. Jack, in imitation of Wat 
Tyler, though he was a very different and inferior 
sort of man, addressed the Kentish men upon their 
wrongs , occasioned by the bad government of 
England, among so many battledores and such a 
poor shuttlecock; and the Kentish men rose up to 
the number of twenty thousand. Their place of 
assembly was Blaekheath, where, headed by Jack, 
they put forth two papers, which they called “The 
Complaint of the Commons of Kent, 11 and “The 
Requests of the Captain of the Great Assembly in 
Kent.” They then retired to Sevenoaks. The royal 
army coming up with them here, they beat it and 
killed their general. Then, Jack dressed himself 
in the dead general’s armour, and led his men to 
London. 

Jack passed into the City from Southwark, over 
the bridge, and entered it in triumph, giving the 
strictest orders to his men not to plunder. Having 
made a show of his forces there, while the citizens 
looked on quietly, he went back into Southwark in 
good order, and passed the night. Next day, he 
eame back again, having got hold in the meantime 
of Lord Say, an unpopular nobleman. Says Jack 
to the Lord Mayor and judges; “Will you be so 
good as to make a tribunal in- Guildhall, and try 
me this nobleman?” The court being hastily made, 
he was found guilty, and Jack and his men cut

his head off on CornhilL They also cut off the 
head of his son-in-law, and then went back in good 
order to Southwark again. 

But, although the citizens could bear the be- 
heading of an unpopular lord, they could not bear 
to have their houses pillaged. And it did so happen 
that Jack, after dinner — perhaps he had drunk 
a little too much — began to plunder the house 
where he lodged; upon which, of course, his men 
began to imitate him. Wherefore, the Londoners 
took counsel with Lord Scales, who had a thousand 
soldiers in the Tower; and defended London Bridge, 
and kept Jack and his people out. This advantage 
gained, it was resolved by divers great men to 
divide Jack’s army in the old way, by making a 
great many promises on behalf of the state, that 
were never intended to be performed. This did 
divide them; some of Jack’s men saying that they 
ought to take the conditions which were offered, 
and others saying that they ought not, for they 
were only a snare; some going home at once; 
others staying where they were; and all doubting 
and quarrelling among themselves. 

Jack, who was in two minds about fighting 
or accepting a pardon, and who indeed did both, 
saw at last that there was nothing to expect from 
his men, and that it was very likely some of them 
would deliver him up and get a reward of a thou- 
sand marks, which was offered for his apprehension. 
So, after they had travelled and quarrelled all the way 
from Southwark to Blackheath, and from Blackheath 
to Rochester, he mounted a good horse and galloped

away into Sussex. But, there galloped after him, 
on a better horse, one Alexander Idea, who came 
up with him, had a hard fight with him, and killed 
him. Jack’s head was set aloft; on London Bridge, 
with the face looking towards Blackkeath, where 
he had raised his dag; and Alexander Iden got 
the thousand marks. 

It is supposed by some, that the Duke of York, 
who had been removed from a high post abroad 
through the Queen’s influence, and sent out of the 
way, to govern Ireland, was at the bottom of this 
rising of Jack and his men, because he wanted to 
trouble the Government He claimed (though not 
yet publicly) to have a better right to the throne 
than Henry of Lancaster, as one of the family of 
the Earl of March, whom Henry the Fourth had 
set aside. Touching this claim, which, being through 
female relationship, was not according to the usual 
descent, it is enough to say that Henry the Fourth 
was the free choice of the people and the Parlia- 
ment, and that his family had now reigned undis- 
puted for sixty years. The memory of Henry the 
Fifth was so famous, and the English people loved 
it so much, that the Duke of York’s claim would, 
perhaps, never have been thought of (it would have 
been so hopeless) but for the unfortunate circum- 
stance of the present King’s being by this time 
quite an idiot, and the country very badly governed. 
These two circumstances gave the Duke of York a 
power he could not otherwise have had. 

Whether the Duke knew anything of Jack Cade, 
or not, he came over from Ireland while Jack’s

head was on London Bridge; being secretly ad- 
vised that the Queen was setting up his enemy, 
the Duke of Somerset, against him. He went to 
Westminster, at the head of four thousand men, 
and on his knees before the King, represented to 
him the bad state of the country, and petitioned 
him to summon a Parliament to consider it. This 
the King promised. When the Parliament was 
summoned, the Duke of Tork accused the Duke of 
Somerset, and the Duke of Somerset accused the 
Duke of York; and, both in and out of Parliament, 
the followers of each party were full of violence 
and hatred towards the other. At length the Duke 
of York put himself at the head of a large force 
of his tenants, and, in arms, demanded the refor- 
mation of the Government. Being shut out of 
London, he encamped at Dartford, and the royal 
army encamped at Blackheath. According as either 
side triumphed , the Duke of York was arrested, or 
the Duke of Somerset was arrested. The trouble 
ended, for the moment, in the Duke of York re- 
newing his oath of allegiance, and going in peace 
to one of his own castles. 

Half a year afterwards the Queen gave birth 
to a son, who was very ill received by the people, 
and not believed to be the son of the King. It 
shows the Duke of York to have been a moderate 
man unwilling to involve England in new troubles, 
that he did not take advantage of the general dis- 
content at this time, but really acted for the public 
good. He was made a member of the cabinet, and 
the King being now so much worse that he could

not be -carried about and shown to the people with 
any decency, the duke was made Lord Protector 
of the kingdom, until he should recover, or the 
Prince should come of age. At the same time the 
Duke of Somerset was committed to the Tower. 
So, now the Duke of Somerset was down, and the 
Duke of York was up. By the end of the year, 
however, the King recovered his memory and some 
spark of sense; upon which the Queen used her 
power — which recovered with him — to get the 
Protector disgraced, and her favorite released. So 
now the Duke of York was down, and the Duke 
of Somerset was up. 

These ducal ups and downs gradually separated 
the whole nation into the two parties of York and 
Lancaster, and led to those terrible civil wars long 
known as the Wars of the Red and White Roses, 
because the red rose was the badge of the House 
of Lancaster, and the white rose was the badge of 
the House of York. 

The Duke of York, joined by some other power- 
ful noblemen of the White Rose party, and leading 
ft small army, met the Kin g with another small 
army at St Alban’s, and demanded that the Duke 
of Somerset should be given up. The poor King, 
being made to say in answer that he would sooner 
die, was instantly attacked. The Duke of Somer- 
set was killed, and the King himself was wounded 
in the neck, and took refuge in the house of a 
poor tanner. Whereupon, the Duke of York went 
to him, led him with great submission to the Abbey, 
and said he was very sorry for what had happened.

Haying now the King in Ms possession, lie got a 
Parliament summoned and himself once more made 
Protector, but, only for a few months; for, on the 
King getting a little better again, the Queen and 
her party got him into their possession, and disT 
graced the Duke once more. So, now the Duke 
of York was down again. 

Some of the best men in power, seeing the 
danger of these constant changes, tried even then 
to prevent the Red and White Rose Wars. They 
brought about a great council in London between 
the two parties. The White Roses assembled in 
Blackfriars, the Red Roses in Whitefriars; and 
some good priests communicated between them, 
and made the proceedings known at evening to the 
King and the judges. They ended in a peaceful 
agreement that there should be no more quarrel- 
ling; and there was a great royal procession to St. 
Paul’s, in wMch the Queen walked arm-in-arm 
with her old enemy, the Duke of York, to show 
the people how comfortable they all were. This 
state of peace lasted half a year, when a dispute 
between the Earl of Warwick (one of the Duke’s 
powerful friends) and some of the Kin g’s servants 
at Court, led to an attack upon that Earl — who 
was a White Rose — and to a sudden breaking 
out of all the old animosities. So, here were 
greater ups and downs than ever. 

There were even greater ups and downs than 
these, soon after. After various battles, the Duke 
of York Bed to Ireland, and his son the Earl of 
March to Calais, with their friends the Earls of

Salisbury and Warwick; and a Parliament was 
held declaring them all traitors. Little the worse 
for this, the Earl of Warwick presently came back, 
landed in Kent, was joined by the Archbishop of 
Canterbury and other powerful noblemen and gen- 
tlemen, engaged the King’s forces at Northampton, 
signally defeated them, and took the King himself 
prisoner, who was found in his tent Warwick 
would have been glad, I dare say, to have taken 
the Queen and Prince too, but they escaped into 
Wales and thenee into Scotland. 

The King was carried by the victorious force 
straight to London, and made to call a new Par- 
liament, which immediately declared that the Duke 
of York and those other noblemen were not traitors, 
but excellent subjects. Then, back comes the Duke 
from Ireland at die head of five hundred horsemen, 
rides from London to Westminster, and enters the 
House of Lords. There, he laid his hand upon 
the cloth of gold which covered the empty throne, 
as if he had half a mind to sit down in it — but 
he did not. On the Archbishop of Canterbury 
asking him if he would visit the King, who was 
in the palace close by, he replied U I know no one 
in this country, my lord, who ought not to visit 
w*.” None of the lords present, spoke a single 
word; so, the duke went out as he had come in, 
established himself royally in the King’s palace, 
and, six days afterwards , sent in to the Lords a 
formal statement of his claim to the throne. The 
lords went to the King on this momentous subject, 
and after a great deal of discussion, in which the

judges and the other law officers were afraid to 
give an opinion on either side , the question was 
compromised. It was agreed that the present King 
should retain the crown for his life , and that it 
should then pass, to the Duke of York and his heirs. 

But, the resolute Queen, determined on asserting 
her son’s rights, would hear of no such thing. She 
came from Scotland to the north of England, where 
several powerful lords armed in her cause. The 
Duke of York, for his part, set off with some five 
thousand men, a little time before Christmas Day, 
one thousand four hundred and sixty, to give her 
battle. He lodged at Sandal Castle, near Wake* 
field, and the Red Roses defied him to come out 
on Wakefield Green, and fight them then and there. 
EBs generals said, he had, best wait until his gal- 
lant son, the Earl of March, came up with his 
power; but, he was determined to accept the chal- 
lenge. He did so, in an evil hour. He Was hotly 
pressed on aH sides, two thousand of his men lay 
dead on Wakefield Green, and he himself was 
taken prisoner. They set him down in mock state 
on an ant-hill* and twisted grass about his head; 
and pretended to pay court to him on their knees; 
saying, “0 King, without a kingdom, and Prince 
without a people, we hope your gracious Majesty 
is very well and happy!” They did worse than^ 
this; they cut his head off, and handed it on a 
pole to the Queen, who laughed with delight when 
she saw it (you recollect their walking so religiously 
and comfortably to St. Paul’s!), and had it fixed, 
with a paper crown upon its head, on the walls of

Fork The Earl of Salisbury lost his head, too; 
and the Duke of York’s second son, a handsome 
boy who was flying with his tutor over Wakefield 
Bridge, was stabbed in the heart by a murderous 
lord — Lord Clifford by name — whose father had 
been killed by the White Roses in the fight at St. 
Alban’s, There was awful sacrifice of life in this 
battle, for no quarter was given, and the Queen 
was wild for revenge. When men unnaturally fight 
against their own coutrymen, they are always ob- 
served to be more unnaturally cruel and filled with 
rage than they are against any other enemy* 

But, Lord Clifford had stabbed the second son 
of the Duke of York — not the first. The eldest 
son, Edward Earl of March, was at Gloucester; 
and, vowing vengeance for the death of his father, 
bis brother, and their faithful friends, he began to 
march against the Queen. He had to turn and 
fight a great body of Welsh and Irish first, who 
worried his advance. These he defeated in a great 
fight at Mortimer’s Cross, near Hereford, where he 
beheaded a number of the Red Roses taken in 
battle, in retaliation for the beheading of the White 
Boses at Wakefield. The Queen had the next 
turn of beheading. Having moved towards Lon- 
don, and falling in, between St, Alban’s and Barnet, 
with the Earl of Warwick and the Duke of Nor- 
folk, White Roses both, who were there with an 
army to oppose her, and had got the King with 
them; she defeated them with great loss, and struck 
off the heads of two prisoners of note, who were 
in the Bang’s tent with him, and to whom the Bong

had promised his protection. Her triumph, however, 
was very short. She had no treasure, and her 
army subsisted by plunder. This caused them to 
be hated and dreaded by the people, and particu- 
larly by the London people, who were wealthy. 
As soon as the Londoners heard that Edward, Earl 
of March, united with the Earl of Warwick, was 
advancing towards the city, they refused to send 
the Queen supplies, and made a great rejoicing. 

The Queen and her men retreated with all 
speed, and Edward and Warwick came on, greeted 
with loud acclamations on every side. The courage, 
beauty, and virtues of young Edward could not be 
sufficiently praised by the whole people. He rode 
into London like a conqueror, and met with an 
enthusiastic welcome. A few days afterwards, Lord 
Falconbridge and the Bishop of Exeter assembled 
the citizens in St. John’s Field, Clerkenwell, and 
asked them if they would have Henry of Lancaster 
for their King? To this they all roared, “No, no, 
no!” and “King Edward! King Edward!” Then, 
said those noblemen, would they love and serve 
young Edward? To this they all cried, “Yes, yes!” 
and threw up their caps and clapped their hands, 
and cheered tremendously. 

Therefore, it was declared that by joining the 
Queen and not protecting those two prisoners of 
note, Hemy of Lancaster had forfeited the crown; 
and Edward of York was proclaimed King. He 
made a great speech to the applauding people at 
Westminster, and sat down as sovereign of England 
on that throne, on the golden covering of which

his father — Worthy of a better fate than the bloody 
axe which cut the thread of so many lives in 
England, through so many years — had laid his 
hand. 


CHAPTER XXm. 

ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FOURTH. 

King Edward the Fourth was not quite 
twenty-one years of age when he took that unquiet 
seat upon the throne of England. The Lancaster 
party, the Red Roses, were then assembling in 
great numbers near York, and it was necessary to 
give them battle instantly. But, the stout Earl of 
Warwick leading for the young King, and the 
young King himself closely following him, and the 
English people crowding to the Royal standard, 
the White and the Red Roses met, on a wild March 
day when the snow was falling heavily, atTowton; 
and there such a furious battle raged between them, 
that the total loss amounted to forty thousand men 
— all Englishmen, fighting, upon English ground, 
against one another. The young King gained the 
day, took down the heads of his father and brother 
from the walls of York, and put up the heads of 
some of the most famous noblemen engaged in the 
battle on the other side. Then, he went to Lon- 
don and was crowned with great splendor. 

A new Parliament met No fewer than one 
hundred and fifty of the principal noblemen and

gentlemen on the Lancaster side were declared 
traitors, and the King — who had very little hur 
inanity, though he was handsome in person and 
agreeable in manners— resolved to do all he could,, 
to pluck up the Bed Bose root and branch. 

Queen Margaret, however, was still active for 
her young son. She obtained help from Scotland 
and from Normandy, and took several important 
English castles. But, Warwick soon retook them; 
the Queen lost all her treasure on board ship in a 
great storm; and both she and her son suffered 
great misfortunes. Once, in the winter weather, 
as they were riding through a forest, they were 
attacked and plundered by a party of robbers ; 
and, when they had escaped from these men and 
were passing alone and on foot through a thick 
dark part of the wood, they came, all at once, upon 
another robber. So the Queen, with a stout heart, 
took the little Prince by the hand, and going 
straight up to that robber, said to him, “My friend, 
this is the young son of your lawful King l I con- 
fide him to your care.” The robber was surprised, 
but took the boy in his arms, and faithfully restored 
him and his mother to their friends. In the end, 
the Queen’s soldiers being beaten and dispersed) 
she went abroad again, and kept quiet for the 
present. 

Now, all this time, the deposed King Henry 
was concealed by a Welsh knight, who kept him 
close in his castle. But, next year, the Lancaster 
party recovering their spirits, raised a large body 
of men, and called him out of his retirement, to

pat lam at their head. They were joined by some 
powerful noblemen who had sworn fidelity to the 
new King, but who were ready, as usual, to break 
their oaths, whenever they thought there was any- 
thing to be got by it One of the worst things in 
the history of the war of the Red and White Roses, 
is the ease with which these noblemen, who should 
hare set an example of honor to the people, left 
either side as they took slight offence, or were dis- 
appointed in their greedy expectations, and joined 
the other. Well! Warwick’s brother soon beat the 
Lancastrians, and the false noblemen, being taken, 
were beheaded without a moment’s loss of time. 
The deposed King had a narrow escape; three of 
kis servants were taken, and one of them bore his 
cap of estate, which was set with pearls and em- 
broidered with two golden crowns. However, the 
ta&d to which the cap belonged, got safely into 
Lancashire, and lay pretty quietly there (the people 
ia the secret being very tame) for more than a 
year. At length, an old monk gave such intel- 
ligence as led to Henry’s being taken while he 
was sitting at dinner in a place ealled Waddington 
Hall He was immediately sent to London and 
met at Islington by the Karl of Warwick, by whose 
directions he was put upon a horse with his legs 
tied under H, and paraded three times round the 
pillory. Them, he was carried off to the Tower, 
where they treated him well enough. y 

The White Rose being so triumphant, the young 
King abandoned himself entirely to pleasure, and 
led a jovial life. But, thorns were springing up.

For, haying been privately married to Elizabeth 
WooDVHiLB, a young widow lady, very beautiful 
and very captivating; and at last resolving to make 
his secret known, and to declare her his Queen; 
he gave some offence to the Edrl of Warwick, who 
was usually called the King-Maker, because of hie 
power and influence, and because of his having 
lent such great help to placing Edward on the 
throne. This offence was not lessened by the 
jealousy with which the Nevil family (the Earl of 
Warwick’s) regarded the promotion of the Wood- 
ville family. For, the young Queen was so bent 
on providing for her relations, that she made her 
father an earl and a great officer of state; married 
her five sisters to young noblemen of the highest 
rank; and provided for her younger brother, a 
young man of twenty, by marrying him to an im- 
mensely rich old duchess of eighty. The Earl of 
Warwick took all this pretty graciously for a man 
of his proud temper, until the question arose to 
whom the hang’s sister, Margaret, should be mar- 
ried. The Earl of Warwick said, 4< To one of the 
French Bang’s sons,” and was allowed to go, ever 
to the French King to make friendly proposals for 
that purpose, and to hold all manner of friendly 
interviews with him. But, while he was so en- 
gaged, the WoodviHe party married the young 
lady to the Duke of Burgundy! Upon this he came 
back in great rage and scorn, and shut himself up 
discontented, in his Castle of Middleham.

was pitched up between the Earl of Warwick and 
Ike King, and lasted until the Earl married hie 
daughter, against the King's wishes, to die Duke 
of Clarence. While the marriage was being ceb- 
heated at Calais, the people in the north of Eng- 
land, where the mfluenee of the Nevil family was 
strongest, broke out into rebeUian; their complaint 
was, that England was oppressed and plundered 
by the Woodyille family, whom they demanded to 
hare removed horn power. As they were joined 
by great numbers of people, and as they openly 
declared that they were supported by the Earl of 
Warwick, the King did not know what to do. At 
last, as he wrote to the earl beseeching his aid, he 
and his new son-in-law eame over to England, and 
began to arrange the business by Shutting the King 
up in Middleham Castle in the safe keeping of the 
Archbishop of York; so England was not only in 
the strange position of having two kings at once, 
but they were both prisoners at the same time. 

Even as yet, however, the King-Maker was so 
far true to the King, that he dispensed a new rising 
of the Lancastrians, took their leader prisoner, and 
brought him to the King, who ordered him to be 
immediately executed. He presently allowed the 
King to return to London, mad there innumerable 
pledges of forgiveness and friendship were exchanged 
between them, and between the Nevils and the 
Woodvilbs; the King's eldest daughter was pro- 
mised in marriage to the heir of the Nevil family; 
and more friendly oaths were sworn, and more 
friendly promises made, than this book would hold.

They lasted about three months. At the end of 
that time, the Archbishop of York made & feast 
for the King, the Earl of Warwick, and the Duke 
of Clarence, at his house, the Moor, in Hertford- 
shire. The King was washing his hands before 
supper, when some one whispered him that a body 
of a hundred men were lying in ambush outside 
the house. Whether this were true or untrue, the 
King took fright, mounted his horse, and rode 
through the dark night to Windsor Castle* Aik- 
other reconciliation was patched up between him 
and the King-Maker, but it was a short one, and 
It was the last. A new rising took place in Lin- 
colnshire, and the King marched to repress it. 
Having done so, he proclaimed that both the Earl 
of Warwick and the Duke of Clarence were trai- 
tors, who had secretly assisted it, and who had 
been prepared publicly to join it, on. the following 
day. In these dangerous circumstances they both 
took ship and sailed away to the French court 

And here a meeting took place between the 
Earl of Warwick and his old enemy, the Dowager 
Queen Margaret, through whom his father had had 
his head struck off, and to whom he had been a 
bitter foe. But, now, when he said that he had 
done with the ungrateful and perfidious Edward of 
York, and that henceforth he devoted himself to 
the restoration of the House of Lancaster, either 
in the person of her husband or of her little son, 
she embraced him as if he had ever been her dearest 
friend. She did more than that ; she married her 
son to his second daughter, the Lady Anne. How-

ever agreeable this marriage was to the two new 
friends, it was very disagreeable to the Duke of 
Clarence, who perceived that his father-in-law, the 
King-Maker, would never make Amt King, now. 
80, being but a weak-minded young traitor, pos- 
sessed of very little worth or sense, he readily 
listened to an artful court lady sent over for the 
purpose, and promised to turn traitor once more, 
and go over to his brother, King Edward, when a 
fitting opportunity should come. 

The Earl of Warwick, knowing nothing of this, 
soon redeemed his promise to the Dowager Queen 
Margaret, by invading England and landing at 
Plymouth, where he instantly proclaimed King 
Henry, and summoned all Englishmen between the 
ages of sixteen and sixty, to join his banner. 
Then, with his army increasing as he marched 
along, he went northward, and came so near King 
Edward, who was in that part of the country, that 
Edward had to ride hard for it to the coast of 
Norfolk , and thence to get away in such ships as 
he could find, to Holland. Thereupon, the trium- 
phant King-Maker and his false son-in-law, the 
Duke of Clarence, went to London, took the old 
King out of the Tower, and walked him in a 
great procession to St. Paul's cathedral with the 
crown upon his head. This did not improve the 
temper of the Duke of Clarence, who saw himself 
farther off from being King than ever; but he kept 
his secret, and said nothing. The Nevil family 
were restored to all their honors and glories, and 
the WoodviUes and the rest were disgraced. The

King-Maker, less sanguiniuy than the King, shed 
no blood except that of the Earl of Worcester , who 
had been so cruel to the people as to have gained 
the title of the Butcher. Him they caught hidden 
in a tree, and him they tried and executed. No 
ether death stained the King-Maker's triumph. 

To dispute this triumph, hack came King Ed- 
ward again, next year, landing at Eawenspur, 
coming on to York, causing all his men to cry 
“Long live King Henry!" and swearing on the 
altar, without a blush, that he came to lay no 
claim to the crown. Now was the time for the 
Duke of Clarence, who ordered his men to assume 
the White Hose, and declare for his brother. 'Pie 
Marquis of Montague, though the Earl of War- 
wick's brother, also declining to fight against King 
Edward, he went on successful to London, where 
die Archbishop of York let him into the CSity , and 
where the people made great demonstrations in his 
favor. For this they had four reasons* Firstly, 
there were great numbers of the King's adherents 
hiding in the City and ready to break out*, secondly, 
die King owed them a great deal of money , which 
they could never hope to get if he were unsuccess- 
ful; thirdly, there was a young prince to inherit 
the crown; and fourthly, the King was gay and 
handsome, and more papular than a better man 
might have been with the City ladies. After a 
stay of only two days with these worthy supporters, 
the King marched out to Barnet Common, to give 
the Earl of Warwick battle. And now it was to

Be seen, for die last time, whether the King-Maker 
Was to cany die day. 

While the Battle was yet pending, the faint- 
hearted Duke of Clarence began to repent, and 
sent over secret messages to his father-in-law, offer* 
mg his services m mediation With the King; But, 
die Earl of Warwick disdainfully rejected them, 
and replied that Clarence was fake and perjured, 
and that he would settle the quarrel by the sworcL 
The battle began at four o’clock in the morning 
and lasted until ten, and during the greater part 
of die time it was fought in a thick mist — ab- 
surdly supposed to be raised by a magician. The 
loss of life was very great, for the hatred was 
strong on both sides. The King-Maker was de- 
feated, and the King triumphed. Both the Earl of 
Warwick and his brother were slain, and their 
bodies lay in St. Paul’s, for some days, as a spec- 
tacle to the people; 

Margaret’s spirit was not broken even by this 
great blow. Within five days she was in arms 
again, and raised her standard in Bath, whence 
she set off with her army, to try and join Lord 
Pembroke, who had a force in Wales. But, the 
King, coming up with her outside the town of 
Tewkesbury, and ordering his brother, the Dues 
of (SLCPuctfiWEB, who was a brave soldier, to at- 
tack her men, she sustained an entire defeat, and 
was taken prisoner, together with her son now only 
eighteen years of age. The conduct of the Bang 
to this poor youth was worthy of his cruel cha- 
racter. He ordered him to be led into his tent*

“And what,” said he, “brought you to England?” 
“I came to England,” replied the prisoner, with a 
spirit which a man of spirit might have admired in 
a captive, “to recover my father’s kingdom, which 
descended to him as his right, and from him de- 
scends to me, as mine.” The King, drawing off 
his iron gauntlet, struck him with it in the face; 
and the Duke of Clarence and some other lords, 
who were there, drew their noble swords, and killed 
him. 

His mother survived him, a prisoner, for five 
years; after her ransom by the King of France, 
she survived for six years more. Within three weeks 
of this murder, Henry died one of those convenient 
sudden deaths which were so common in the Tower, 
in plainer words, he was murdered by the King’s 
order. 

Having no particular excitement on his hands 
after this great defeat of the Lancaster party, and 
being perhaps desirous to get rid of some of his 
fat (for he was now getting too corpulent to be 
handsome), the King thought of making war on 
France. As he wanted more money for this pur- 
pose than the Parliament could give him, though 
they were usually ready enough for war, he in- 
vented a new way of raising it, by sending for the 
principal citizens of London, and telling them, 
with a grave face, that he was very much in want 
of cash, and would take it very kind in them if 
they would lend him some. It being impossible 
for them safely to refuse, they complied, and the 
monies thus forced from them were called — no

doubt to die great amusement of tlie King and the 
Court — as if they were free gifts, “Benevolences.” 
What with grants from Parliament, and what with 
Benevolences, the King raised an army and passed 
over to Calais. As nobody wanted war, however, 
the French King made proposals of peace, which 
were accepted, and a truce was concluded for seven 
long years. The proceedings between the Kings 
of France and England on this occasion, were very 
friendly, very splendid, and very distrustful. They 
finished with a meeting between the two Kings, on 
a temporary bridge over the river Somme, where 
they embraced through two holes in a strong wooden 
grating like a lion's cage, and made several bows 
and fine speeches to one another. 

It was time, now, that the Duke of Clarence 
should be punished for his treacheries; and Fate 
had Ins punishment in store. He was, probably, 
not trusted by the King — for who could trust 
him who knew him I — and he had certainly a 
powerful opponent in his brother Richard, Duke 
of Gloucester, who, being avaricious and ambitious, 
wanted to marry that widowed daughter of the 
Earl of Warwick’s who had been espoused to the 
deceased young Prince, at Calais. Clarence, who 
wanted all the family wealth for himself, secreted 
this lady, whom Richard found disguised as a ser- 
vant in the City of London, and whom he married; 
arbitrators appointed by the King, then divided the 
property between the brothers. This led to ill-will 
and mistrust between them. Clarence’s wife dying,

of such charges. He was found guilty, and seat*

was supposed at the time that he was told to choose 
the manner of his death, and that he chose to be 
drowned in a butt ef Malmsey wine. I hope the 
story may be true, for it would have been a be- 
coming death for snob & miserable creature. 

The King survived him some five years. He 
died in the forty-second year of his life, and the 
twenty-third of his reign. He had a very good 
capacity and some good points, hut he was selfish, 
careless, sensual, and cruel. He was a favorite 
with the people for his showy manners; and the 
people were a good example to him in the con- 
stancy of their attachment. He was penitent on 
his death-bed for his “benevolences,” and other 
extortions, and ordered restitution to be made to

CHAPTER XXIV. 

ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIFTH. 

The late Xing's eldest son., the Prince of 
Wales , called Edward after him , was only thirteen 
years of age at his father's death. He was at 
Ludlow Castle with his uncle, the Earl of Rivers. 
The prince’s brother, the Duke of York, only eleven 
years of age, was in London with his mother. The 
boldest, mast crafty, and most dreaded nobleman 
in England at that time was their unde Richard* 
Duke of Gloucester, and everybody wondered how 
the two poor boys would fare with such an unde 
for a friend or a foe. 

The Queen, their mother, being exceedingly 
uneasy about this, was anxious that instructions 
should be sent to Lord. Rivers to raise an army to 
escort the young King safely to London. But, 
Lord Hastings, who was of the Court party op- 
posed to the Woodvilles, and who disliked the 
thought of giving them that power, argued against 
the proposal, and obliged the Queen to be satisfied 
with an escort of two thousand horse. The Duke 
of Gloucester did nothing, at first, to justify sus- 
picion. He came from Scotfcmd (where he was 
commanding an army) to York, and was there the 
fast to swear allegiance to his nephew. He then

wrote a condoling letter to the Queen-Mother, and 
set off to be present at the coronation in London. 

Now, the young King, journeying towards Lon- 
don too, with Lord Rivers and Lord Gray, came 
to Stony Stratford, as his uncle came to Northamp- 
ton, about ten miles distant; and when those two 
lords heard that the Duke of Gloucester was so 
near, they proposed to the young King that they 
should go back and greet hin^ in his name. The 
boy being very willing that they should do so, they 
rode off and were received with great friendliness, 
and asked by the Duke of Gloucester to stay and 
dine with him. In the evening, while they were 
merry together, up came the Duke of Buckingham 
with three hundred horsemen; and next morning 
the two lords and the two dukes, and the three 
hundred horsemen, rode away together to rejoin 
the King. Just as they were entering Stony Strat- 
ford, the Duke of Gloucester, checking his horse, 
turned suddenly on the two lords, charged them 
with alienating from him the affections of his sweet 
nephew, and caused them to be arrested by the 
three hundred horsemen and taken back. Then, 
he and the Duke of Buckingham went straight to 
the King (whom they had now in their power), to 
whom they made a show of kneeling down, and 
offering great love and submission; and then they 
ordered his attendants to disperse and took him, 
alone with them, to Northampton. 

A few days afterwards they conducted him to 
London, and lodged him in the Bishop’s Palace. 
But, he did not remain there long; for, the Duka

of Buckingham with a tender face made a speech 
expressing how anxious he was for the Royal boy’s 
safety, and how much safer he would be in the 
Tower until his coronation, than he could be any- 
where else. So, to the Tower he was taken, very 
carefully, and the Duke of Gloucester was named 
Protector of the State. 

Although Gloucester had proceeded thus far 
with a very smooth countenance — and although 
he was a clever man, fair of speech, and not ill- 
looking, in spite of one of his shoulders being 
something higher than the other — and although he 
had come into the City riding bareheaded at the 
King’s side, and looking very fond of him — he 
had made the King’s mother more uneasy yet; and 
when the Royal boy was taken to the Tower, she 
became so alarmed that she took sanctuary in 
Westminster with her five daughters. 

Nor did she do this without reason, for, the 
Duke of Gloucester, finding that the lords who 
were opposed to the Woodville family were faithful 
to the young King nevertheless, quickly resolved 
to strike a blow for himself. Accordingly, while 
those lords met in council at the Tower, he and 
those who were in his interest met in separate 
council at his own residence, Crosby Palace, in 
Bishopsgate Street. Being at last quite prepared, 
he one day appeared unexpectedly at the council 
in the Tower, and appeared to be very jocular 
and merry. He was particularly gay with the 
Bishop of Ely: praising the strawberries that grew 
in his garden on Holborn Hill , and asking him to

have some gathered that he might eat them at 
dinner. The Bishop, quite proud of the honor > 
sent one of his men to fetch some; and the Duke, 
still very jocular and gay, went out; and the couzr- 
cil all said what a very agreeable duke he was! 
In a HttLe time, however, he came back quite al- 
tered — not at all jocular — • frowning and fierce 
— and suddenly said, 

“What do those persons deserve who have com- 
passed my destruction; I being the King’s lawful, 
as well as natural, protector?” 

To this strange question, Lord Hastings replied, 
that they deserved death, whosoever they were. 

“Then,” said the Duke, “I tell you that they 
are that sorceress my brother’s wife;” meaning the 
Queen; “and that other sorceress, Jane Shore. 
Who, by witchcraft, have withered my body, and 
caused my arm to shrink as I now show you.” 

He then pulled up his sleeve and showed them 
his arm, which was shrunken, it is true, but which 
had been so, as they all very well knew, from the 
hour of his birth. 

Jane Shore, being then the lover of Lord Hast- 
ings, as she had formerly been of the late King, 
that lord knew that he himself was attacked. So, 
he said, in some confusion, “Certainly, my Lord, 
if they have done this, they be worthy of punish- 
ment.” 

“If?” said the Duke of Gloucester; “do yon 
talk to me of ifs? I tell you that they have so 
done, and I will make it good upon thy body, 
thou traitor!”

With that, he strode the table a great blow 
with has fist. This was a signal to some of his 
people outside, to cry “Treason I” They immedia- 
tely did so, and there was a rush into the chamber 
of so many armed men that it was filled in a mo- 
ment. 

“First,” said the Duke of Gloucester to Lord 
Hastings, “I arrest thee, traitor! And let him,” he 
added to the armed men who toed: him, “have a 
priest at once, for by St Paul 1 will not dine until 
I have seen his head off!” 

Lord Hastings was hurried to the green by the 
Tower chapel, and there beheaded on a log of 
wood that happened to be lying on the ground. 
Then, the Duke dined with a good appetite, and 
after dinner summoning the principal citizens to 
attend ham, told them that Lord Hastings and the 
rest had designed to murder both himself and the 
Duke of Buckingham, who stood by his side, if he 
had not providentially discovered their design. He 
requested them to be so obliging as to inform their 
fellow-citizens of the truth of what he said, and 
issued a proclamation (prepared and neatly copied 
out beforehand) to the same effect 

On the same day that the Duke did these things 
in the Tower, Sir Richard Rateliffe , the boldest 
and most undaunted of Ins men, went down to 
Pontefract; arrested Lord Rivers, Lord Gray, and 
two other gentlemen; and publicly executed them 
on the scaffold, without any trial, for having in- 
tended the Duke’s death. Three days afterwards 
the Duke, not to lose time, went down the river

to Westminster in his barge, attended by fivers 
bishops, lords and soldiers, and demanded that the 
Queen should deliver her second son, the Duke of 
York, into his safe keeping. The Queen, being 
obliged to comply, resigned the child after she had 
wept over him; and Bichard of Gloucester placed 
him with his brother in the Tower. Then, he 
seized Jane Shore, and, because she had been the 
lover of the late King, confiscated her property, 
and got her sentenced to do public penance in the 
streets by walking in a scanty dress, with bare 
feet, and carrying a lighted candle, to St Paul’s 
Cathedral through the most crowded part of the 
City. 

Having now all things ready for his own ad- 
vancement, he caused a friar to preach a sermon 
at the cross which stood in front of St. Paul’s Ca- 
thedral, in which he dwelt upon the profligate 
manners of the late King, and upon the late shame 
of Jane Shore, and hinted that the princes were 
not his children. “Whereas, good people,” said 
the friar, whose name was Shaw, “my Lord the 
Protector, the noble Duke of Gloucester, that sweet 
prince, the pattern of all the noblest virtues, is the 
perfect image and express likeness of his father. 
There had been a little plot between the Duke and 
the friar, that the Duke should appear in the crowd 
at this moment, when it was expected that the 
people would cry “Long live King Kiehard!” 
either through the friar saying the words too soon, 
or through the Duke’s coming too late, the Dufco 
and the words did not come together,' and the

people only laughed, and the friar sneaked off 
ashamed. 

The Duke of Buckingham was a better hand 
at such business than the friar, so he went to the 
Guildhall next day, and addressed the citizens in 
the Lord Protector’s behalf. A few dirty men, 
who had been hired and stationed there for the 
purpose, crying when he had done, “God save 
King Bichard !” he made them a grave bow, and 
thanked them with all his heart. Next day, to 
make an end of it, he went with the mayor and 
some lords and citizens to Baynard Castle, by the 
river, where Bichard then was* and read an ad- 
dress, humbly entreating him to accept the Crown 
of England. Bichard, who looked down upon them 
out of a window and pretended to be in great 
uneasiness and alarm, assured them there was no- 
thing he desired less, and that his deep affection 
for his nephews forbade him to think of it To 
this the Duke of Buckingham replied, with pre- 
tended warmth, that the free people of England 
would never submit to his nephew’s rule, and that 
if Bichard, who was the lawful heir, refused the 
Crown, why then they must find some else to wear 
it The Duke of Gloucester returned that since 
he used that strong language, it became his pain- 
ful duty to think no more of himself and to accept 
the Crown. 

Upon that, the people cheered and dispersed*, 
and the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of 
Buckingham passed a pleasant evening, talking

over the play they had just acted with so much 
success, and every word of which they had pre- 
pared together. 


CHAPTER XXV. 

ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE THIRD. 

King Richard the Third was up betimes in the 
morning, and went to Westminster Hall. In the 
Hall was a marble seat, upon which he sat himself 
down between two great noblemen, and told the 
people that he began the new reign in that place, 
because the hrst duly of a sovereign was to admi- 
nister the laws equally to all, and to maintain 
justice. He then mounted his horse and rode back 
to the City, where he was received by the clergy 
and the crowd as if he really had a right to the 
throne , and really were a just man. The clergy 
and the crowd must have been rather ashamed of 
themselves in secret, I think, for being such poor- 
spirited knaves. 

The new King and his Queen were soon crowned 
with a great deal of show and noise, which the 
people liked very much; and then the King set 
forth on a royal progress through his dominions. 
He was crowned a second time at York, in order 
that the people might have show and noise enough; 
and wherever he went was received with shouts of 
rejoicing — from a good many people of strong 
lungs, who were paid to strain their throats in

crying “God save King Richard I” The plan was 
so successful that I am told it has been imitated 
since, by other usurpers, in other progresses through 
other dominions. 

While he was on this journey, King Richard 
stayed a week at Warwick. And from Warwick 
he sent instructions home for one of the wickedest 
murders that ever was done — the murder of the 
two young princes, his nephews, who were shut 
np in the Tower of London. 

Sir Robert Brackenbury was at that time Go- 
vernor of the Tower. To him, by the hands of a 
messenger named John Green, did King Richard 
send a letter, ordering him by some means to put 
the two young princes to death. But Sir Robert 
— I hope because he had children of his own, 
and loved them — sent John Green back again, 
riding and spurring along the dusty roads, with 
the answer that he could not do so horrible a piece 
of work. The King having firowningly considered 
a little, called to him Sir James Tvbrel, his 
Master of the horse, and to him gave authority to 
take command of the Tower, whenever he would, 
for twenty-four hours, and to keep all the keys of 
the Tower during that space of time. Tyrrel, well 
knowing what was wanted, looked about him for 
two hardened ruffians, and chose John Dighton, 
one of his own grooms, and Miles Forest, who 
was a murderer by trade. Having secured these 
two assistants, he went, upon a day in August, to 
the Tower, showed his authority from the King, 
took the command for four-and-twenty hours, and

obtained possession of the keys. And when the 
black night came, he went creeping, creeping, like 
a guilty villain as he was, up the dark stone wind- 
ing stairs, and along the dark stone passages, until 
he came to the door of the room where the two 
young princes, having said their prayers, lay fast 
asleep, clasped in each other’s arms. And while 
he watched and listened at the door, he sent in 
those evil demons, John Dighton and Miles Forest, 
who smothered the two princes with the bed and 
pillows, and carried their bodies down the stairs, 
and buried them under a great heap of stones at 
the staircase foot. And when the day came, he 
gave up the command of the Tower, and restored 
the keys, and hurried away without once looking 
behind him; and Sir Robert Brackenbury went with 
fear and sadness to the princes’ room, and found 
the princes gone for ever. 

You know, through all this histoiy, how true it 
is that traitors are never true, and you will not be 
surprised to learn that the Duke of Buckingham 
soon turned against King Richard, and joined a 
great conspiracy that was formed to dethrone him, 
and to place the crown upon its rightful owner’s 
head. Richard had meant to keep the murder se- 
cret; but when he heard through his spies that this 
conspiracy existed, and that many lords and gen- 
tlemen drank in secret to the two young princes 
in the Tower, he made it known that they were 
dead. The conspirators, though thwarted for a 
moment, soon resolved to set up for the crown 
against the murderous Richard, Henry Earl of

Richmond , grandson of Catherine: that widow of 
Henry the Fifth, who married Owen Tudor. And 
as Henry was of the house of Lancaster, they pro- 
posed that he should marry the Princess Elizabeth, 
the eldest daughter of the late Fang, now the 
heiress of the house of York and thus by uniting 
\he rival families put an end to the fatal wars of 
the red and white Roses. All being settled, a 
time was appointed for Henry to come over from 
Brittany, and for a great rising against Richard to 
take place in several parts of England at the same 
hour. On a certain day, therefore, in October the 
revolt took place; but, unsuccessfully. Richard 
was prepared, Henry was driven back at sea by a 
storm, his followers in England were dispersed, 
and the Duke of Buckingham was taken and at 
once beheaded in the market-place at Salisbury. 

The time of his success was a good time, Ri- 
chard thought, for summoning a Parliament and 
getting some money. So, a Parliament was called, 
and it flattered and fawned upon him as much as 
he could possibly desire, and declared him to be 
the rightful King of England, and his only son 
Edward, then eleven years of age, the next heir to 
the throne. 

Richard knew full well that, let the Parliament 
say what it would, the Princess Elizabeth was re- 
membered by people as the heiress of the House 
of York; and having accurate information besides, 
of its being designed by the conspirators to marry 
her to Henry of Richmond, he felt that it would 
much strengthen him and weaken them, to be be-

forehand with them, and many her to his son. 
With this view he went to the Sanctuary at Yt* 
minster, where the late King’s widow and her 
daughter still were, and besought them to come to 
Court: where (he swore by anything and every- 
thing) they should he safely and honorably enter- 
tained. They came, accordingly, but had scarce^ 
been at Court a month when his son died sud- 
denly — or was poisoned — and his plan was 
crushed to pieces. 

In this extremity King Richard, always active, 
thought “I must make another plan.” And^ he ; 
made the plan of marrying the Princess Elizabeth 
himself, although she was his niece. There was 
one difficulty in the way: his wife, the Queen 
Anne, was alive. But, he knew (remembering his 
nephews) how to remove that obstacle, and * 
made love to the Princess Elizabeth, telling her lie 
felt perfectly confident that the Queen would die 
in February. The Princess was not a very scru- 
pulous young lady, for, instead of rejecting the 
murderer of her brothers with scorn and hatred, 
she openly declared that she loved him dearly, 
and, when February came and the Queen did not 
die, she expressed her impatient opinion that she 
was too long about it. However, King Richard 
was not so far out in his prediction, but that she 
died in March — he took good care of that — 
then this precious pair hoped to be married. But 
they were disappointed, for the idea of such a mar 
riage was so unpopular in the country , that the 
King’s chief counsellers, Ratcliffe and Catbsbt,

would by no means undertake to propose it, and 
the King w^s even obliged to declare in public 
that he had never thought of such a thing. 

He was, by this time, dreaded and hated by 
all classes of his subjects. His nobles deserted 
every day to Henry’s side; he dared not call an- 
other Parliament, lest his crimes should be de- 
nounced there; and, for want of money, he was 
obliged to get Benevolences from the citizens, which 
exasperated them all against him. It was said too, 
that, being stricken by his conscience, he dreamed 
frightful dreams, and started up in the night-time, 
wild with terror and remorse. Active to the last, 
through all this, he issued vigorous proclamations 
against Henry of Bichmond and all his followers, 
when he heard that they were coming against him 
With a Fleet from France; and took the field as 
fierce and savage as a wild boar — the animal re- 
presented on his shield. 

Henry of Richmond landed with six thousand 
men at Milford Haven, and came on against King 
Bichard, then encamped at Leicester with an army 
twice as great, through North Wales. OnBosworth 
Field, the two armies met; and Bichard, looking 
along Henry’s ranks, and seeing them crowded 
with the English nobles who had abandoned him, 
turned pale when he beheld the powerful Lord 
Stanley and his son (whom he had tried hard to 
retain) among them. But, he was as brave as he 
was wicked, and plunged into the thickest of the 
fight. He was riding hither and thither, laying 
about him in all directions, when he observed the

Earl of Northumberland — one of his few great 
allies — to stand inactive, and the main body of 
his troops to hesitate. At the same moment, his 
desperate glance caught Henry of Eichmond among 
a little group of his knights. Biding hard at him, 
and crying “Treason!” he killed his standard- 
bearer, fiercely unhorsed another gentleman, and 
aimed a powerful stroke at Henry himself, to cut 
him down. But, Sir William Stanley parried it as 
•it fell, and before Bichard could raise his arm 
again, he Was borne down in a press of numbers, 
unhorsed, and killed. Lord Stanley picked up the 
crown, all bruised and trampled, and stained with 
blood, and put it upon Bichmond’s head, amid loud 
and rejoicing cries of “Long live King Henry!” 

That night, a horse was led up to the church 
of the Grey Friars at Leicester: across whose back 
was tied, like some worthless sack, a naked body, 
brought there for burial. It was the body of the 
last of the Plantagenet line, King Bichard the 
Third, usurper and murderer, slain at the battle of 
Bosworth Field in the thirty-second year of his 
age, after a reign of two years.

Richard the Third. He was very cold, crafty, and 
calculating, and would do almost anything for 
money. He possessed considerable ability, but his 
chief merit appears to have been that he was not 
cruel when there was nothing to be got by it. 

The new King had promised the nobles who 
had espoused his cause that he would marry the 
princess Elizabeth. The first thing he did, was, 
to direct her to be removed from the castle of 
Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire, where Richard had 
placed her, and restored to the care of her mother 
in London. The young Earl of Warwick, Edward 
Plantagenet, son and heir of the late Duke of Cla- 
rence, had been kept a prisoner in this same old 
Yorkshire castle with her. This boy, who was now 
fifteen, the new King placed in the Tower for safe- 
ty. Then he came to London in great state, and 
gratified the people with a fine procession; on 
which kind of show he often very much relied for 
keeping them in good humour. The sports and 
feasts which took place were followed by a ter- 
rible fewer, called the Sweating Sickness; of which 
great numbers of people died. Lord Mayors and 
Aldermen are thought to have suffered most from 
it; whether because they were in the habit of over- 
eating themselves , or because they were very 
jealous of preserving filth and nuisances in the 
City (as they have been since), I don’t know. 

The King’s coronation was postponed on ac- 
count of the general ill-health, and he afterwards 
deferred his marriage , as if he were not very anxious 
that it should take place: and, even after that, de-

ferred the Queen’s coronation so long that he gave 
offence to the York party. However, he set these 
things right in the end, by hanging some men and 
seizing on the rich possessions of others; and grant- 
ing more popular pardons to the followers of the 
late King than could, at first, be got from him; 
and by employing about his Court some not very , 
scrupulous persons who had been employed in the 1 
previous reign. j 

As this reign was principally remarkable for 
two very curious impostures which have become 
famous in history, we will make those two stories 
its principal feature: 

There was a priest at Oxford of the name of 
Simons, who had for a pupil a handsome boy 
named Lambert Simnel, who was the son of a 
baker. Partly to gratify his own ambitious ends, 
and partly to carry out the designs of a secret 
party formed against the King, this priest declared 
that his pupil, the boy, was no other than the young 
Earl of Warwick; who (as everybody might have 
known) was safely locked up in the Tower of Lon- 
don. The priest and the boy went over to Irer 
land , and at Dublin enlisted in their cause all ranks 
of the people: who seem to have been generous 
enough, but exceedingly irrational. The Earl of 
Kildare, the governor of Ireland, declared that he 
believed the boy to be what the priest represented; 
and the boy, who had been well tutored by the 
priest, told them such things of his childhood, and 
gave them so many descriptions of the Royal fa* 
mily, that they were perpetually shouting and hur-

railing) and drinking bis health) and making all 
kinds of noisy and thirsty demonstrations, to ex- 
press their belief in him. Nor was this feeling con- 
fined to Ireland alone, for the Earl of Lincoln 
whom the late usurper had named as his successor, 
went over to the young Pretender; and, after hold- 
ing a secret correspondence with the Dowager 
Duchess of Burgundy — the sister of Edward the 
Fourth, who detested the present King and all his 
race — sailed to Dublin with two thousand Ger- 
man soldiers of her providing. In this promising 
state of the boy’s fortunes , he was crowned there, 
with a crown taken off the head of a statue of the 
Virgin Mary; and was then, according to the Irish 
custom of those days , carried home on the shoulders 
of a big chieftain possessing a great deal more 
strength than sense. Father Simons, you may be 
sure, was mighty busy at the coronation. 

Ten days afterwards, the Germans, and the 
Irish, and the priest, and the boy, and the Earl 
of Lincoln, all landed in Lancashire to invade Eng- 
land The King, who had good intelligence of 
their movements, set up his standard at Notting- 
ham, where vast numbers resorted to him every 
day, while the Earl of Lincoln could gain but very 
few. With his small force he tried to make for 
the town of Newark; but the King’s army, getting 
between him and that place, he had no choice but 
to risk a battle at Stoke. It soon ended in the 
complete destruction of the Pretender’s forces, one 
half of whom were killed; among them, the Earl 
himself. The priest and the baker’s boy were taken

prisoners. The priest, after confessing the trick, 
was shut up in prison, where he afterwards died — 
suddenly perhaps; the boy was taken into the King’s 
kitchen and made a turnspit. He was afterwards 
raised to the station of one of the King’s falconers; 
and so ended this strange imposition. 

There seems reason to suspect that the Dowager 
Queen — always a restless and busy woman — 
had had some share in tutoring the baker’s boo. 
The Bang was very angry with her, whether or no. 
He seized upon her property, and shut her up in 
a convent at Bermondsey. 

One might suppose that the end of this story 
would have put the Irish people on their guard; 
but, they were quite ready to receive a second im- 
postor, as they had received the first, and that 
same troublesome Duchess of Burgundy soon gave 
them the opportunity. All of a sudden there ap- 
peared at Cork, in a vessel arriving from Portugal, 
a young man of excellent abilities, of very hand- 
some appearance and most winning manners, who 
declared himself to be Bichard , Duke of York, the 
second son of King Edward the Fourth. “ 0,” said 
some, even of those ready Irish believers; “but 
surely that young Prince was murdered by Ids 
uncle in the Tower!” — “It is supposed so,” said 
the engaging young man; “and my brother uras 
killed in that gloomy prison; but I escaped — it 
don’t matter how, at present — and have been 
wandering about the world for seven long years.” 
This explanation being quite satisfactory to num - 
hers of the Irish people, they began again to shout

and to hurrah, and to drink his health, and to 
make the noisy and thirsty demonstrations all over 
again. And the big chieftain in Dublin began to 
look out for another coronation, and another young 
King to be carried home on his back. 

Now, King Henry being then on bad terms 
with France, the French King, Charles the Eighth 
saw that, by pretending to believe in the hand- 
some young man, he could trouble his enemy 
sorely. So, he invited him over to the French 
Court, and appointed him a body-guard, and treated 
bim in all respects as if he really were the Duke 
of York Peace, however, being soon concluded 
between the two Kings , the pretended Duke was 
tamed adrift, and wandered for protection to the 
Duchess of Burgundy. She, after feigning to in- 
quire into the reality of his claims, declared him 
ta be the very picture of her dear departed brother; 
gave him a body-guard at her Court, of thirty hal- 
berdiers; and called him by the sounding name of 
tbe White Bose of England. 

The leading members of the White Rose party 
m England sent over an agent, named Sir Robert 
Clifford, to ascertain whether the White Rose’s 
claims were good; the King also sent over his 
agents . to inquire into the Rose’s history. The 
White Roses declared the young man to be really 
tae Duke of York; the King declared him to be 
Periik Warbeck, the son of a merchant of the 
city of Tournay , who had acquired his knowledge 
°f England, its language and manners, from the 
English merchants who traded in Flanders; it was

also stated by the Royal agents that he had been 
in the service of Lady Brompton, the wife of an 
exiled English nobleman, and that the Duchess of 
Burgundy had caused him to be trained and taught, 
expressly for tins deception. The King then re- 
quired the Archduke Philip , who was the sovereign 
of Burgundy, to banish this new Pretender, or to 
deliver him up; but, as the Archduke replied that 
he could not control the Duchess in her own land, 
the King, in revenge, took the market of English 
cloth away from Antwerp, and prevented all com- 
mercial intercourse between the two countries. 

He also, by arts and bribes, prevailed on Sr 
Robert Clifford to betray his employers; and he 
denouncing several famous English noblemen as 
being secretly the friends of Perkin Warbeck, the 
King had three of the foremost executed at once. 
Whether he pardoned the remainder because they 
were poor, I do not know; but it is only too pro- 
bable that he refused to pardon one famous noble- 
man against whom the same Clifford soon after- 
wards informed separately, because he was rich. 
This was no other than Sir William Stanley, who 
had saved the King’s life at the battle of Bos worth 
Field. It is very doubtful whether his treason 
amounted to much more than his having said, that 
if he were sure the young man was the Duke of 
York, he would not take arms against him. What- 
ever he had done he admitted, like an honourable 
spirit; and he lost his head for it, and the covetous 
King gained all his wealth. 

Perkin Warbeck kept quiet for three years;

but, as die Flemings began to complain heavily of 
the loss of their trade by the stoppage of the Ant- 
werp market on his account, and as it was not un- 
likely that they might even go so far as to take 
Ms life or give him up, he found it necessary to 
do something. Accordingly he made a desperate 
sally, and landed, with only a few hundred men, 
on the coast of Deal. But he was soon glad to get 
back to the place from whence he came; for the 
country people rose against his followers, killed a 
great many, and took a hundred and fifty pri- 
soners: who were all driven to London tied together 
with ropes, like a team of cattle. Every one of 
them was hanged on some part or other of the sea- 
shore , in order that if any more men should come 
over with Perkin Warbeck, they might see the 
bodies as a warning before they landed. 

Then the wary King, by making a treaty of 
commerce with the Flemings, drove Perkin War- 
beck out of that country; and, by completely gain- 
ing over the Irish to bis side, deprived him of that 
asylum too* He wandered away to Scotland , and 
told his story at that Court. King James the 
Fourth of Scotland, who was no friend to King 
Henry, and had no reason to be (for King Henry 
had bribed his Scotch lords to betray him more 
than once, but had never succeeded in his plots), 
gave him a great reception, called him his cousin, 
and gave him in marriage the Lady Catherine 
Gordon, a beautiful and charming creature related 
to the royal house of Stuart.

Pretender, the King still undermined, and bought, 
and bribed, and kept his doings and Perkin War- 
beck's story in the dark, when he might, one woulcl 
imagine, have rendered the matter clear to all Eng- 
land. But, for all his bribing of the Scotch lord* 
at the Scotch King’s Court, he could not procure 
the Pretender to be delivered up to him. James, 
though not very particular in many respects, would 
not betray him, and the ever-busy Duchess of Bur- 
gundy so provided him with arms , and good soldiers, 
and with money besides, that he had soon a little 
army of fifteen hundred men of various nations. 
With, these, and aided by the Scottish King in per- 
son, he crossed the borders into England, and made 
a proclamation to the people, in which he called 
the King “Henry Tudor;” offered large rewards 
to any who should take or distress him; and an- 
nounced himself as King Richard the Fourth, come 
to receive the homage of his faithful subjects. 
His faithful subjects, however, cared nothing for 
him, and hated his faithful troops: who, being 
of different nations, quarrelled also among them- 
selves. Worse than this, if worse were possible, 
they began to plunder the country; upon which 
the White Rose said, that he would rather lose 
his rights, than gain them through the miseries 
of the English people. The Scottish King made 
a jest of his scruples, but they and their whole 
force went back again without fighting a battle. 

The worst consequence of this attempt was, that 
a rising took place among the people of Cornwall, 
who considered themselves too heavily taxed to

meet the charges of the expected war, Stimulated 
by Flammock, a lawyer, and Joseph, a black* 
smith, and joined by Lord Audley and some other 
country gentlemen, they marched on all the way 
to Deptford Bridge, where they fought a battle 
with the King’s army. They were defeated — 
though the Cornish men fought with great bravery 

— and the lord was beheaded, and the lawyer and 
the blacksmith were hanged, drawn, and quartered* 
The rest were pardoned. The Kin g, who believed 
every man to be as avaricious as himself, and 
thought that money could settle anything, allowed 
them to make bargains for their liberty with the

aboard slip with everything necessary for their 
comfort and protection, and sailed for Ireland. 

But, the Irish people had had enough of counter- 
feit Earls of Warwick and Dukes of York, for one 
while; and would give the White Bose no aid. So, 
the White Bose — encircled by thorns indeed — 
resolved to go with his beautiful wife to Cornwall 
as a forlorn resource, and see what might be made 
of the Cornish men, who had risen so valiantly a 
little while before, and had fought so bravely at 
Deptford Bridge. 

To Whitsand Bay, in Cornwall, accordingly, 
came Perkin War beck and bis wife; and the lovely 
lady be shnt up for safety in the Castle of St 
Michael’s Mount, and then inarched into Devon- 
shire at the head of three thousand Cornish men. 
These were increased to six thousand by the time 
of his arrival in Exeter; but, there the people made 
a stout resistance, and he went on to Taunton, 
where he came in sight of the King’s army. The 
stout Cornish men, although they were few in num- 
ber, and badly armed, were so bold, that they 
never thought of retreating, but bravely looked 
forward to a battle on the morrow. Unhappily, for 
them, the man who was possessed of so many en- 
gaging qualities , and who attracted so many people 
to his side when he had nothing else with which 
to tempt them, was not as brave as they. In the 
night, when the two armies lay opposite to each 
other, he mounted a swift horse and fled. When 
morning dawned, the poor confiding Cornish men, 
discovering that they had no leader, surrendered

to the King's power. Some of them were hanged, 
and the rest were pardoned, and went miserably 
home. 

Before the King pursued Perkin War beck to 
the sanctuary of Beaulieu in the New Forest, where 
it was soon known that he had taken refuge he 
sent a body of horsemen to Saint Michael's Mount, 
to seize his wife. She was soon taken and brought 
as a captive before the King. But she was so 
beautiful, and so good, and so devoted to the man 
in whom she behoved, that the King regarded her 
with compassion, treated her with great respect, 
and placed her at Court, near the Queen's person. 
And many years after Perkin Warbeck was no 
more, and when his strange story had become like 
a nursery tale, she was called the White Rose, by 
the people, in remembrance of her beauty. 

Tbe sanctuary at Beaulieu was soon surrounded 
by the King's men; and the King, pursuing his 
usual dark artful ways, sent pretended friends to 
Perkin Warbeok to persuade him to come out mid 
surrender himself 'This he soon did; tie King 
having taken a good look at the man of whom, be 
had heard so much — from behind a screen — di- 
rected him to be well mounted, and to ride behind 
him at a little distance, guarded, but not bound in 
any way. So they entered London with the King's 
favorite show — a procession; and some of the 
people hooted as the Pretender rode slowly through 
the streets to the Tower; hut the greater part were 
quiet, and very curious to see him. From the 
Tower, he was taken to the Palace at Westminster,

and there lodged like a gentleman, though closely 
watched. He was examined every now and then 
as to his imposture; but the King was so secret in 
all he did, that even then, he gave it a conse- 
quence, which it cannot be supposed to have in it- 
self deserved. 

At last Perkin Warbeck ran away, and took 
refuge in another sanctuary hear Richmond in Sur- 
rey. From this he was again persuaded to deliver 
himself up; and being conveyed to London, he 
stood in the stocks for a whole day, outside West- 
minster Hall, and there read a paper purporting 
to be his full confession, and relating his history 
as the King’s agents had originally described it. 
He was then shut up iii the Tower again , in the 
company of the Earl of Warwick, who had now 
been there for fourteen years: ever since his re- 
moval out of Yorkshire , except when the King had 
had him at Court, and had shown him to the people, 
to prove the imposture of the Baker’s boy. It is 
but too probable, when we consider the crafty 
character of Henry the Seventh, that ihese two 
were brought together for a cruel purpose. A plot - 
was soon discovered between them and the keepers, 
to murder the Governor, get possession of the keys, 
and proclaim Perkin Warbeck as King Richard the 
Fourth. That there was some such plot, is likely; 
that they were tempted into it, is at least as likely; 
that the unfortunate Earl of Warwick — last made 
of the Plantagenet line — was too unused to the 
world, and too ignorant and simple to know much 
about it, whatever it was, is perfectly certain; and

that it was the King's interest to get rid of him, 
is no less so. He was beheaded on Tower Hill, 
and Perkin Warbeck was hanged at Tyburn. 

Such was the end of the pretended Duke of 
York, whose shadowy history was made more 
shadowy — and ever will be henceforth — by the 
mystery and craft of the King. If he had turned 
his great natural advantages to a more honest ac- 
count, he might have lived a happy and respected 
life, even in those days. But he died upon a gal- 
lows at Tyburn, leaving the Scottish lady who had 
loved him so well, kindly protected at the Queen's 
Court After some time she forgot her old loves 
and troubles, as so many people do with Time’s 
merciful assistance and married a Welsh gentleman. 
Her second husband, Sir Matthew Cbadog, more 
honest and more happy than her first, lies beside 
her in a tomb in the old church of Swansea. 

The ill-blood between France and England in 
his reign, arose out of the continued plotting of 
the Duchess of Burgundy, and disputes respecting 
the affairs of Brittany. The King feigned to be 
very patriotic, indignant, and warlike; but he al- 
ways contrived so as never to make war in reality, 
and always to make money. His taxation of the 
people, on pretence of war with France, involved, 
atone time, a very dangerous insurrection, headed 
hy Sir John Egremont, and a common man called 
John, k Chambre. But it was subdued by the royal 
forces, under the command of the Earl of Surrey. 
The knighted John escaped to the* Duchess of 
Burgundy, who was ever ready to receive any one

who gave the King tronble; and the plain John 
was hanged at York, in the midst of a number of 
his men, hut on a much higher gibbet, as being a 
greater traitor. Hung high or hung low, how- 
ever, hanging is much the same to the person 
hung. 

Within a year after her marriage, the Queen 
had given birth to a son, who was -called Prince 
Arthur, in remembrance of the old British prince 
of romance and story*, and who, when all these 
events had happened, being then in his M&enth 
year, was married to Catherine, the daughter of 
the Spanish monarch, with great rejoicings and 
bright prospects; but in a very few months he 
sickened ^and died. As soon as the King had re- 
covered from his grief, he thought & a pitythat 
the fortune of the Spanish Princess, mnounfoaig to 
two hundred thousand crowns , should go ont of the 
‘fondly; and therefore arranged that foe young widow 
should marry his second son Henry, then twelve 
years of age, when he too should be fifteen. There 
were objections to tins marriage on the part of foe 
clergy; but as foe infallible Pope was gained over, 
and as he must be right, that settled foe business 
for foe time. The King’s eldest daughter was pro- 
vided for, and a long course of disturbance was 
considered to be set at rest, by her being married 
to the Scottish King. 

And: now foe Queen died. When foe King had 
got over that grief too , his mind once more reverted 
to his darling money for consolation, and he thought 
°f marrying the dowager Queen of Naples, who was

practicable to gain the money , however practicable 
it might have been to gain the lady, he gave up. 
the idea. He was not so fond of her but that he 
soon proposed, to marry the Dowager Duchess of 
Savoy, and soon afterwards the widow of the King 
of Castile who was raving mad. But he made a 
money-bargain instead, and married neither. 

The Duchess of Burgundy, among the other 
discontented people to whom she had given, re&ige, 
had sheltered Edmund d® da Pole (younger brother 
of that Earl ef Lincoln who was killed at Stoke), 
now Earl of Suffolk* The King had prevailed upon 
him to return, to the marriage of Prince Arthur; 
hut hei soon afterwards went away again; and then 
the Kin g, suspecting a conspiracy, resorted to his 
favoariteplan oi sending him some treacherous friends, 
and buying of those scowndrels the secrets they 
disclosed or invented. Some arrests and executions 
took place in consequence. In the end, the King, 
on a promise of not taking his life, obtained pos- 
session of the person of Edmund de la Pole, and 
shut him up in the Tower. 

This was his last enemy. If he had lived much 
longer he would have made many more among the 
people, by the grinding exaction to which he con-

this juncture, and ended the King’s reign. He died 
of the gout on the twenty-second of April, one 
thousand five hundred and nine, in the fifty-third 
year of his age, after reigning twenty-four years; 
and was buried in the beautiful Chapel of West- 
minster Abbey, which he had himself founded, and 
which still bears his name. 

It was in this reign that the great Christopher 
Columbus, on behalf of Spain, discovered what 
was then called The New World. Great wonder, 
interest, and hope of wealth being awakened in 
England thereby, the King and the merchants of 
London and Bristol fitted out an English expedi- 
tion for further discoveries in the New World, and 
entrusted it to Sebastian Cabot, of Bristol, the 
son of a Venetian pilot there. He was very suc- 
cessful in his voyage, and gained high reputation, 
both for himself and England. 


1 CHAPTER XXVII. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH. 

We now come to King Henry the Eighth, 
whom it has been too much the fashion to call 
“Bluff King Hal,” and “Burly King Harry,” and 
other fine names; but whom I shall take the li- 
berty to call, plainly, one of the most detestable 
villains that ever drew breath. You will be able 
to judge, long before we come to the end of his 
life, whether he deserves the character.

He was just eighteen years of age when he 
came to the throne. People said he was hand- 
some then; but I don't believe it He was a big, 
burly, noisy, small-eyed, large-faced, doubled- 
chinned, swinish lookmg fellow in later life (as we 
know from the likenesses of him, painted by the 
famous Hans Holbein), and it is not easy to be- 
lieve that so bad a character can ever have been 
veiled under a prepossessing appearance. 

He was anxious to make himself popular, and 
<he people, who had long disliked the late King, 
were very willing to believe that he deserved to be 
so. He was extremely fond of show and display, 
and so were they. Therefore there was great re- 
joicing when he married the Princess Catherine, 
and when they were both crowned. And the King 
fought at tournaments and always came off victo- 
rious — for the courtiers took care of that — and 
there was a general outcry that he was a wonder- 
ful man. Empson, Dudley, and their supporters 
were accused of a variety of crimes they had never 
committed, instead of the offences of which they 
really had been guilty; and they were pilloried, 
and set upon horses with their faces to die tails, 
and knocked about, and beheaded, to the satisfac- 
tion of the people, and the enrichment of the King. 

The Pope, so indefatigable in getting the world 
into trouble, had mixed himself up in a war on the 
continent of Europe, occasioned by the reigning 
Princes of little quarrelling states in Italy having 
at various times married into other Royal families, 
and so led to their claiming a share in those petty

Governments. The King, who discovered that he 
was very fond of the Pope, sent a herald to the 
King of Prance, to say that he must not make war 
upon that holy personage, because he was the 
father of all Christians. As; the French King did 
not mind this relationship in the least , and also re* 
fused to admit a claim King Henry made to cer- 
tain lands in France, wax was declared between 
the two countries. Not to perplex this story with 
an account of the tricks and designs of all the so- 
vereigns who were engaged in it, it is enough to 
say that England made & blundering alliance with 
Spain, and got stupidly taken in by that country, 
which made its own terms with France when it 
could, and left England in the lurch. Sib Edward 
Howard, & hold admiral, son of the Earl of Sur* 
rey r distinguished himself by his bravery against 
the French in this business; but, unfortunately, he 
was; more brave than wise, for, skimming into the 
French harbour of Brest with only a few rowboats, 
he attempted (in revenge for the defeat and death 
of Sir. Thomas Knyvett, another bold English 
Admiral) to take some strong French ships, well 
defended with batteries of cannon. The upshot 
was, that he was left on board of oue of them (in 
consequence of its shooting away from his own 
boat), with not more than about a dozen men, and 
was thrown into the sea and drowned: though not 
until he had taken from his breast his gold chain 
and gold whistle, which were the signs of his office, 
and had cast them into the sea to prevent their 
being made a boast of by the enemy. After this

defeat — which was a great one, for Sir Edward 
Howard was a man of valor and fame — the King 
took it into his head to invade Franco in person, 
first executing that dangerous Earl of Suffolk whom 
his father had left in the Tower, and appointing 
Queen Catherine to the eharge of hie kingdom in 
his absence. He sailed to Calais, where he was 
joined by Maximilian , Emperor of Germany, who 
pretended to be his soldier, and who took pay in 
his service: with a good deal of nonsense of that 
sort, flattering enough to the vanity of a vain 
blusterer. The King might be successful enough 
in sham fights, hut his idea of real battles chiefly 
consisted in pitching silken tents of bright colors 
that were ignommiousiy blown down by the wind, 
and in making a vast display of gaudy flags and 
golden curtains. Fortune, however, favored him 
better than he deserved, for, after much waste of 
time in tent pitching, flag flying, gold curtaining, 
and other such masquerading, he gave the French 
battle at a place called Guinegate: where they took 
such an unaccountable panic, and fled with such 
swiftness , that it was ever afterwards called by the 
English the Battle of Spurs. Instead of following 
up his advantage, the King, finding that he had 
had enough of real fighting, came home again. 

The Scottish King, though nearly related to 
Henry by marriage, had taken part against him 
in this war. The Earl of Surrey, as the English 
general, advanced to meet him when he came out 
of his own dominions and crossed the river Tweed. 
The two armies came up with one another when

the Scottish King had also crossed the river Till, 
and was encamped upon the last of the Cheviot 
Hills, called the Hill of Flodden. Along the plain 
below it, the English, when the hour of battle 
came, advanced. The Scottish army, which had 
been drawn up in five great bodies, then came 
steadily down, in perfect silence. So they, in their 
turn, advanced to meet the English army which 
came on in one long line; and they attacked it 
with a body of spearmen, under Lord Home. At 
first they had the best of it, but the English re- 
covered themselves so bravely, and fought with 
such valor, that when the Scottish King had al- 
most made his way up to the Royal standard, he 
was slain, and the whole Scottish power routed. 
Ten thousand Scottish men lay dead that day on 
Flodden Field, and among them, numbers of the 
nobility and gentry. For a long time afterwards, 
the Scottish peasantry used to believe that their 
Bang had not been really killed in this battle, be- 
cause no Englishman had found an iron belt he 
wore about his body as a penance for having been 
an unnatural and undutiful son. But, whatever 
became of his belt, the English had his sword and 
dagger, and the ring from his finger, and his body 
too, covered with wounds. There is no doubt of 
it, for it was seen and recognised by English gen- 
tlemen who had known the Scottish King well 
When King Henry was making ready to renew 
the war in France, the French King was contem- 
plating peace. His queen dying at this time, he

old, to many King Henry's sister, die Princess 
Mary, who, besides being only sixteen, was be* 
trothed to the Duke of Suffolk. As the inclinations 
of young Princesses were not much considered in 
such matters, the marriage was concluded, and the 
poor girl was escorted to France, where she was 
immediately left as the French King's bride, with 
only one of all her English attendants. That one 
was a pretty young girl named Anne Boleyn, 
niece of the Earl of Surrey, who had been made 
Duke of Norfolk after the victory of Flodden Field. 
Anne Boleyn's is a name to be remembered, as 
you will presently find. 

And now the French King, who was very proud 
of his young wife, was preparing for many years 
of happiness, and she was looking forward, I dare 
say, to many years of misery, when he died within 
three months, and left her a young widow. The 
new FVench monarch, Francis the first, seeing 
how important it was to his interests that she should 
take for her second husband no one but an Eng- 
lishman, advised her first lover, the Duke of Suf- 
folk, when King Henry sent him over to France 
to fetch her home, to marry her. The Princess 
being herself so fond of that Duke, as to tell him 
that he must either do so then, or for ever lose her, 
they were wedded; and Henry afterwards forgave, 
them. In making interest with the King, the Duke 
of Suffolk had addressed his most powerful favorite 
and adviser, Thomas Wolsey — a name very fa- 
mous in history for its rise and downfall. 

Wolsey was the son of a respectable butcher

at Ipswich, in Suffolk, who gave him so excellexn 
an education that he became a tutor to the family 
of the Marquis of Dorset who afterwards got kiir 
appointed one of the late King’s chaplains. Or] 
the accession of Henry the Eighth , he was pro- 
moted mid taken into great favor. He was now 
Archbishop of York; the Pope had made his* & 
Cardinal besides; and whoever wanted influence in 
England, or favor with the King, whether he wero 
a foreign monarch, or an English nobleman, wan 
obliged to make a friend of the great Cardinal 
Wolsey. 

He was a gay man, who could dance and jest, 
and sing and drink; and those were the roada to so 
much, or rather so little, of a heart as King Henry 
had. He was wonderfully fond of pomp and glitter, 
and so was the King. He knew a good deal of 
the Church learning of that time , much of which 
consisted in finding artful excuses and pretences 
for almost any wrong thing, and in arguing that 
black was white, or any other color. This kind 
of learning pleased the King too. For many saeh 
reasons, die Cardinal was high in estimation with 
the King, and being a man of far greater ability, 
knew as well how to manage him, as a clever 
keeper may know how to manage a wolf or a tiger, 
or any other cruel and uncertain beast, that may 
turn upon him and tear him any day, Never had 
there been seen in England such state as my Lord 
Cardinal kept His wealth was enormous: equal, 
it was reckoned, to the riches of the Crown. His 
palaces were as splendid as the King’s, and his

retnwe eight hundred strong. He* held his Court, 
Messed out from top to toe in flaming scarlet, and 
hw very shoes were golden, set with precious stones. 
His followers rode on blood horses, while he, with 
a wonderful affectation of humility' in the midst of 
his great splendor, ambled on a mule with a red 
refret saddle and bridle and golden stirrups. 

Through the influence of this stately priest, a 
grand meeting was arranged to take place , in France, 
b&t on ground belonging to England, between the 
Ewacii and English Bangs. A prodigious show of 
friendship and rejoicing was to be made on the 
WHasion, and heralds were sent to proclaim with 
bnwen trumpets through all the principal cities of 
Europe, that on a certain day, the Kings of France 
o&d England, as companions and brothers in arms, 
eac h attended by eighteen followers , would hold a 
tournament against all knights who might choose 
to come* 

’Charles, the new Emperor of Germany (the 
oM ene being dead), wanted to prevent too cordial 
affiance between these sovereigns , and so came 
war to England before the King could repair to 
&& place of meeting; and besides making an 
agreeable impression upon him, secured Wolsey’s 
aterest by promising that his influence should make 
Pope when the next vacancy occurred. On 
day when the Emperor left England, the King 
an d all the Court went over to Calais, and thence 
to the place of meeting , between Ardres and Guisnes, 
oommouly called the Field of the Cloth of Gold. 
Here, all manner of expense and prodigality was

There were sham castles , temporary chapefcj

splendid jewelled collar, and how Francis gave 
Henry, in return, a costly bracelet All this and 
a great deal more was so written about, and sung 
about, and talked about at that time (and, indeed, 
since that time too), that the world has had good 
cause to be sick of it, for ever. 

Of course, nothing came of all these fine doings 
but a speedy renewal of the war between England 
and France, in which the two Royal companions 
and brothers in arms longed very earnestly to da- 
mage one another. But, before it broke out again, 
the Duke of Buckingham was shamefully executed 
on Tower Hill, on the evidence of a discharged 
servant — really for nothing, except the folly of 
having believed in a friar of the . name of Hop- 
kins, who had pretended to be a prophet, and who 
had mumbled and jumbled out some nonsense about 
the Duke’s son being destined to be very great in 
the land. It was believed that the unfortunate 
Duke had given offence to the great Cardinal by 
expressing his mind freely about the expense and 
absurdity of the whole business of the Field of the 
Cloth of Gold. At any rate, he was beheaded, as 
I have said, for nothing. And the people who saw 
it done were very angry, and cried out that it was 
the work of “the butcher’s son!” 

The new war was a short one, though the Earl 
of Surrey invaded France again, and did some in- 
jury to that country. It ended in another treaty 
of peace between the two kingdoms, and in the 
discovery that the Emperor of Germany was not 
,sueh a good friend to England in reality, as he

pretended to be. Neither did be keep bis premise 
to Wolsey to make him Pope, though the King 
urged him. Two Popes died in pretty quick sue- 
cession, hurt ike foreign priests were too much for 
the Cardinal, and kept Mm out of the post. So 
the Cardinal and King together found oat Mat the 
Emperor of Germany was not a man to keep faith 
with; Moke off a projected marriage between the 
King’s daughter Mart, Princess of Wales, and 
that sovereign; and began to consider whether it 
might not be well to marry Me young lady, either 
to Francis himself, or to his eldest son. 

There now arose at Wittenberg, in Germany, 
the great leader of the mighty change in England 
which is called The Information, and which set 
the people free from their slavery to the priests. 
This was a learned Doctor, named Martin Lu- 
ther, who knew all about Mem, for he had been 
a priest and even a monk, himself. The preaching 
and writing of Wickliffe , mentioned in a former 
article , had set a number of men thinking on this 
subject ; and Luther , finding one day, to his great 
surprise, that there really was a book called the 
New Testament which the priests did not allow to 
he read, and which contained truths that they sup- 
pressed, began to be very vigorous against the 
whole body, from Me Pope downward. It hap- 
pened, while he was yet only beginning his vast 
work of awakening the nation, Mat an impudent 
fellow named Tetzel, a friar of very had charac- 
ter, came into his neighbourhood selling what were 
called Indulgences, by wholesale, to raise money

8t>r beautifying the great Cathedral of St, Peter's, 
at Borne. Whoever bought an Indulgence of the 
Pope was supposed to buy himself off from the 
punishment of Heaven for his offences. Luther 
told the people that these Indulgences were worth- 
less bits of paper, before God, and that Tetzel 
and his masters were a crew of impostors in selling 
them. 

The King and the Cardinal were mightily in- 
dignant at this presumption; and the King (with 
the help of Sir Thomas More, a wise man, whom 
he afterwards repaid by striking off his head) even 
wrote a book about it, with which the Pope was 
so well pleased that he gave the King the title of 
Defender of the Faith. The King and the Cardinal 
also issued flaming warnings to the people not to 
read Luther's books, on pain of excommunication. 
But, they did read them for all that; and the ru- 
mour of what was in them, spread far and wide. 

When this great change was thus going on, the 
King began to show himself in bis truest and worst 
celftra Anne Boleyn, the, pretty little girl who 
had gone abroad to France with: his- sister, was by 
this time grown up to be very beautiful, and was 
one of the ladies in attendance on Queen Catherine. 
Now, Queen Catherine was no longer young or 
handsome, and it is likely that die was not parti- 
cularly good-tempered, having been always rather 
melancholy, and having been made more so by the 
deaths of four of her children when they were very 
young. So, the King fell in love with the fair 
Anne Boleyn, and said to himself, “How can I

best get rid of my own troublesome wife whom 1 
am tired of, and marry Anne?” 

You recollect that Queen Catherine had been 
the wife of Henry’s young brother. What does the 
King do, after thinking it over, but calls his fa- 
vorite priests about him, and says, O, his mind is 
in such a dreadful state, and he is so frightfully 
uneasy, because he is afraid it was not lawful for 
him to marry the Queen! Not one of those priests 
had the courage to hint that it was rather curious 
he had never thought of that before, and that his 
mind seemed to have been in a tolerably jolly con- 
dition during a great many years , in which he cer- 
tainly had not fretted himself thin; but, they all 
said, Ah! that was very true, and it was a serious 
business; and perhaps the best way to make it 
right, would be for His Majesty to be divorced! 
The King replied, Yes, he thought that would 
be the best way, certainly; so they all went to 
work. 

If I were to relate to you the intrigues and 
plots that took place in the endeavour to get this 
divorce, you would think the History of England 
the most tiresome book in the world. So I shall 
say no more, than that after a vast deal of nego- 
ciation and evasion, the Pope issued a commission 
to Cardinal Wolsey and Cardinal Campeggio, 
(whom he sent over from Italy for the purpose) to 
try the whole case in England. It is supposed • 
and I think with reason — that Wolsey was the 
Queen’s enemy, because she had reproved him for 
his proud and gorgeous manner of life. But, he

did not at first know that the King wanted to many 
Anne Boleyn; and when he did know it, he even 
went down on his knees , in the endeavour to dis- 
suade him. 

The Cardinals opened their court in the Con- 
vent of the Black Friars, near to where the bridge 
of that name in London now stands; and the King 
and Queen, that they might be near it, took up 
their lodgings at the adjoining palace of Bridewell, 
of which nothing now remains but a bad prison* 
On the opening of the court, when the King and 
Queen were called on to appear, that poor ill-used 
lady, with a dignity and firmness and yet with a 
womanly affection worthy to be always admired, 
went and kneeled at the King’s feet, and said that 
she had come, a stranger, to his dominions; that 
she had been a good and true wife to him for 
twenty years; and that she could acknowledge no 
power in those Cardinals to try whether she should 
be considered his wife after all that time, or should 
be put away. With that, she got up and left 
the court, and would never afterwards come back 
to it 

The King pretended to be very much over- 
come, and said, 0! my lords and gentlemen, what 
a good woman she was to be sure, and how de- 
lighted he would be to live with her unto death, 
but for that terrible uneasiness in his mind which 
was quite wearing him away! So, the case went 
on , and there was nothing but talk for two months. 
Then Cardinal Campeggio who, on behalf of the 
Pope, wanted nothing so much as delay, adjourned

it for two more; and before that time was elapsed, 
the/ Pope himself adjourned it indefinitely, by re- 
quiring tine King and Queen to come to Some and 
have it tried there. But by good luck for the Bang, 
word was brought to him by some of his people, 
that they had happened to meet at supper Thomas 
Cranmrb, a; learned Doctor of Cambridge , who had 
proposed to urge the Pope on, by referring the 
case to all the learned doctors and bishops r here 
and; there and everywhere , and getting their opinions 
that the King’s marriage was unlawful. The King, 
who was now getting into a hurry to marry Anne 
Boleyn, thought this such a good idea, that he 
sent for Cranmer, post haste, and said to Lord 
Rochegrt, Anne Boieyn’s father, “Take this 
learned Doctor down to your country-house, and 
there let him have; a good room for a study, and 
no end of books out of which to prove that X may 
marry your daughter.” Lord Rochfort, not at all 
reluctant, made the learned Doctor as comfortable 
as he could, and the learned Doctor went to work 
to prove his case. All this time, the King and 
Anne Boleyn were writing letters to one another 
ahnost daily, fall of impatience to have the case 
settled; and Anne Boleyn was showing herself (as 
I think) very worthy of the fate which afterwards

in an y case; but, between tbe hatred of tbe party 
of tbe Queen that was , and tbe hatred of the party 
of the Queen that was to be, he fell suddenly and 
heavily. Going down one day to the Court of 
Chancery, where he now presided, he was waited 
upon by the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, who 
told him that they brought an order to him to re- 
sign that office, and to withdraw quietly to a house 
he had at Esher, in Surrey. The Cardinal re- 
fusing, they rode off to the Kin g, and next day 
same back with a letter from him, on reading which, 
the Cardinal submitted. An inventory was made 
out of all the riches in his palace at York Place 
(now Whitehall), and he went sorrowfully np the 
river, in his barge, to Putney. An abject man be 
was, in spite of his pride, for being overtaken, as 
he was riding out of that place towards Esher, by 
one of the King’s chamberlains who brought him a 
kind message and a ring, he alighted from his 
mule, took off his cap, and kneeled down in the 
dirt. His poor fool, whom in his prosperous days 
he had always kept in his palace to entertain him, 
cut a far better figure than he; ior, when the Car- 
dinal said to the chamberlain that he had nothing 
to send to his lord the King as a present, but that 
jester who was a most excellent one, it took six 
strong yeomen to remove the faithful fool from his 
master.

hundred and sixty servants with him, and seventy-

ciliating that be won all hearts. And indeed, even 
in his proud days, be had done some magnificent 
things for learning and education. At last, he was 
arrested for high treason, and coming slowly on 
his journey towards London, got as far as Lei-

very ill, he said, when the monks came out at the 
gate with lighted torches to receive him , that he 
had come to lay his bones among them. He had

King, He would not have given me over, in my 
grey hairs. Howbeit, this is my just reward for 
my pains and diligence, not regarding my service 
to God, but only my duty to my Prince.” The 
news of his death was quickly carried to the King, 
who was amusing himself with archery in the garden 
of the magnificent Palace at Hampton Court, which 
that very Wolsey had presented to him. The greatest 
emotion his Royal mind displayed, at the loss of 
a servant so faithful and so ruined, was a parti- 
cular desire to lay hold of fifteen hundred pounds

which the Cardinal was reported to have hidden 
somewhere. 

The opinions concerning the divorce, of the 
learned doctors and bishops and others, being at 
last collected, and being generally in the King's 
favor, were forwarded to the Pope, with an en- 
treaty that he would now grant it. The unfortu- 
nate Pope, who was a timid man, was half dis- 
tracted between his fear of his authority being set 
aside in England if he did not do as he was asked, 
and his dread of offending the Emperor of Ger- 
many, who was Queen Catherine’s nephew. In 
this state of mind , he still evaded and did nothing. 
Then, Thomas Cromwell, who had been one of 
Wolsey’s faithful attendants and had remained so, 
even in his decline, advised the King to take the 
matter into his own hands, and make himself the 
head of the whole Church. This, the King, by 
various artful means, began to do, but he re- 
compensed the clergy by allowing them to burn as 
many people as they pleased, for holding Luther’s 
opinions. You must understand that Sir Thomas 
More, the wise man who had helped the King with 
his book, had been made Chancellor in Wolsey’s 
place. But, as he was truly attached to the Church 
as it was, even in its abuses, he in this state of 
things resigned. 

Being now quite resolved to get rid of Queen 
Catherine, and marry Anne Boleyn without more 
ado, the Kin g made Cranmer Archbishop of Can- 
terbury, and directed Queen Catherine to leave the 
Court. She obeyed, but replied that wherever she

went, she was Queen of England still, and would 
remain so, to the last. The King then married 
Anne Boleyn privately; and the new Archbishop 
of Canterbury, within half a year, declared his 
marriage with Queen Catherine void, and crowned 
Anne Boleyn Queen. 

She might have known that no good could ever 
come from such wrong, and that the corpulent 
brute who had been so faithless and so cruel to his 
first wife, could be more faithless and more cruel 
to bis second. She might have known that, even 
when he was in love with her, he had been a mean 
and selfish coward, running away, like a frightened 
cur, from her society and her house, when a 
dangerous sickness broke out in it, and when she 
might easily have taken it and died, as several 
of the household did. But, Anne Boleyn arrived 
at all this knowledge too late, and bought it at a 
dear price. Her bad marriage with a worse man 
came to its natural end. Its natural end was not, 
as we shall too soon see, a natural death for her. 


CHAPTER XXVHL 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH. 

The Pope was thrown into a very angry state 
of mind when he heard of the King's marriage, and 
filmed exceedingly. Many of the English monks 
and friars, seeing that their order was in danger) 
did the same; some even declaimed against ti®

King in church before his face, and were not to 
ha stopped until he himself roared out “Silencer’ 
The King, not much the worse for this, took ; t 
pretty quietly, and was very glad when his Queen 
gave birth to a daughter, who was christened 
Elizabeth, and declared Princess of Wales as her 
sister .Mary had already been. 

One of the most atrocious features of this reign 
was that Henry the Eighth was always trimming be- 
tween the reformed religion and the unreformed one; 
so that the more he quarrelled with the Pope, the 
more of his own subjects be roasted alive for not 
holding the Pope’s opinions. Thus, an unfortunate 
student named John Frith, and a poor simple tai- 
lor named Andrew Hewet who loved him very much 
and said that whatever John Frith believed he be- 
lieved, were burnt in Smithheld — to show wbat a 
capital Christian the King was. 

But, these were speedily followed by two much 
greater victims, Sir Thomas More, and John Fisher 
the Bishop of .Rochester. The latter, who was a good 
and amiable old man, had committed no greater 
offence than believing in Elizabeth Barton, called 
the Maid of Kent — another of those ridiculous 
women who pretended to be inspired, and to make 
4dl sorts of heavenly revelations, though they indeed 
uttered nothing hut vile nonsense. For this offence, 
as it was pretended, but really for denying the King 
to he the supreme Head of the Church, he got into 
trouble, and was put in prison; but, even then, he 
might have been suffered to die naturally (short 
work having been made of executing the Kentish

Maid and her principal followers), but that the Pope, 
to spite the King, resolved to make him a cardinal. 
Upon that, the King made a ferocious joke to the 
effect that the Pope might send Fisher a red hat — 
which is the way they make a cardinal — but he 
should have no head on which to wear it; and he 
was tried with all unfairness and injustice, and sen- 
tenced to death. He died like a noble and virtuous 
old man, and left a worthy name behind him. The 
King supposed, I dare say, that Sir Thomas More 
would be frightened by this example; but, as he was 
not to be easily terrified, and, thoroughly believing 
in the Pope, had made up his mind that the King 
was not the rightful Head of the Church; he posi- 
tively refused to say that he was. For this crime 
he too was tried and sentenced, after having been 
in prison a whole year. When he was doomed to 
death, and came away from his trial with the edge 
of the executioner’s axe turned towards him — as 
was always done in those times when a state pri- 
soner came to that hopeless pass — he bore it quite 
serenely, and gave his blessing to his son, who 
pressed through the crowd in Westminster Hall and 
kneeled down to receive it. But when he got to the 
Tower Wharf, on his way back to his prison, and 
his favorite daughter Margaret Soper, a very good 
woman, rushed through the guards again and again, 
to kiss him and to weep upon his neck, he was over- 
come at last. He soon recovered, and never more 
showed any feeling but cheerfulness and courage. 
When he was going up the steps of the scaffold to 
his death, he said jokingly to the Lieutenant of the

Tower, observing that they were weak and shook 
beneath his tread, “I pray you, master lieutenant, 
see me safe up, and for my coming down I can 
shift for myself.” Also he said to the executioner, 
after he had laid his head upon the block, “Let me 
put my beard out of the way; for that, at least, has 
never committed any treason.” Then his head was 
struck off at a blow. These two executions were 
worthy of King Henry the Eighth. Sir Thomas 
More was one of the most virtuous men in his do* 
minions, and the Bishop was one of his oldest and 
truest Mends. But to be a Mend of that fellow 
was almost as dangerous as to be his wife. 

When the news of these two murders got to 
Borne, the Pope raged against the murderer, more 
than ever Pope raged since the world began, and 
prepared a Bull, ordering his subjects to take arms 
against him and dethrone him. The King took all 
possible precautions to keep that document out of 
his dominions, and set to work in return to sup- 
press a great number of the English monasteries 
and abbeys. 

This destruction was begun by a body of com- 
missioners of whom Cromwell (whom the King had 
taken into great favor) was the head; it was car- 
ried on through some few years to its entire com- 
pletion. There is no doubt that many of these re- 
ligious establishments were religious in nothing but 
in name, and were crammed with lazy, indolent, 
and sensual monks. There is no doubt that they 
imposed upon the people in every possible way; 
that they had images moved by wires , which they

pretended were miraculously moved by Heaven; 
that they had among them a whole ton measure 
full of teeth, all purporting to have come out of 
the head of one saint, who must indeed have been 
a very extraordinary person with that enormous 
allowance of grinders; that they had hits of coal, 
which they said had fried Saint Lawrence, bits of 
toe-nails which they said belonged to other famous 
saints; penknives, and boots, and girdles, which 
“they said belonged to others ; and that *all these 
bits of rubbish were called Relics, and adored by 
the ignorant people. But, on the other hand, there 
is no doubt either, that the King's officers and men 
punished the good monks with the bad, did great in- 
justice, demolished many beautiful things and many 
valuable libraries, destroyed numbers of paintings, 
stained glass windows, fine pavements, and car- 
vings; and that the whole court were ravenously 
greedy and rapacious for the division of this great 
spoil among them. The King seems to have grown 
almost mad in the ardour of this pursuit, for he 
declared Thomas k Becket a traitor, though he had 
bfeen dead so many years, and had hiB body dug 
up out of Ms grave. He must have been as mira- 
culous as the monks pretended, if they had told 
the truth, for he was found with one head on his 
shoulders , and they had shown another as Mb un- 
doubted and genuine head ever since Ms death; it 
had brought them vast sums of money, too. The 
gold and jewels on his Shrine filted ’two great cheats, 
and eight men tottered as they earned them away.

die fact: that, when they were all suppressed, one 
hundred and thirty thousand pounds a -year — in 
those days an immense sum — came to the Crown* 
These things were not done without causing 
great discontent among the. people. The monks 
had been good, landlords and hospitable entertainers 
of all travellers , and had been accustomed to give 
awajr a great deal of com, and fruit, and meat, 
and other things* In those: days it was difficult to 
change, goods into money, in consequence of the 
roads being very few and very bad, and the carts 
and waggons of the worst description; and they 
mush either have given away some of the good 
things they possessed in enormous quantities, or 
have suffered them to spoil and moulder. So, many 
of the people missed what it was more agreeable 
to get idly than to work for;, and. the monks who 
were driven out of their homes and wandered about, 
encoraaged their discontent, and there were conse- 
quently great risings in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. 
These were, put down by terrific executions ,, from 
which the monks themselves did not escape , and 
the King went on grunting and growling in his 
own fat way, like, a Royal pig* 

I have told all this story of the religious houses 
at one time, to make it plainer, and to get back 
to the King’s domestic affaim.

time dead; and the Bang was* by this time as tired 
of his second Queen as he had been of his first*

with another lady in the service of Anne. See how 
wicked deeds are punished, and how bitterly and 
self-reproachftdly the Queen must now have thought 
of her own rise to the throne! The new fancy was 
a Lady Jane Seymour; and the King no sooner 
set his mind on her than he resolved to have Anne 
Boleyn’s head. So, he brought a number of accu- 
sations against Anne, accusing her of dreadfhl Crimea 
which she had never committed, and implicating in 
them her own brother and certain gentlemen in her 
service, among whom one Norris, and Mark Smea- 

ton, a musician, jre best remembered. As the lords 
and councillors were as afraid of the King and as 
subservient to him as the meanest peasant in Eng- 
land, they brought in Anne Boleyn guilty , and the 
other unfortunate persons accused with her, guilty 

too. Those gentlemen died like men, with the ex- 
ception of Smeaton, who had been tempted by the 
King into telling lies, which he called confessions, 
and who had expected to be pardoned; but who, I 
am very glad to say, was not. There was then only 
the Queen to dispose of. She had been surrounded 
in the Tower with women spies, had been mon- 
strously persecuted and foully slandered, and had 
received no justice. But her spirit rose with her 
afflictions, and, after having in vain tried to soften 
the King by writing an affecting letter to him which 
still exists, “from her doleful prison in the Tower,” 
she resigned herself to death. She said to those 
about her, very cheerfully, that she had heard say 
the executioner was a good one, and that she had 
a little neck (she laughed and clasped it with her

bands as she said that), and would soon be out of 
her pain. And she was soon out of her pain, poor 
creature, on the Green inside the Tower, and her 
body was flung into an old box and put away in 
the ground under the chapel. 

There is a story that the King sat in his palace 
listening very anxiously for the sound of the cannon 
which was to announce this new murder; and that, 
when he heard it come booming on the air, he rose 
up in great spirits and ordered out his dogs to go 
a-hunting. He was bad enough to do it; but whe- 
ther he did it or not, it is certain that he married 
Jane Seymour the very next day. 

1 have not much pleasure in recording that she 
lived just long enough to give birth to a son who 
was christened Edward, and then to die of a fever; 
for, I cannot but think that any woman who mar- 
ried such a ruffian, and knew what innocent blood 
was on his hands, deserved the axe that would as- 
suredly have fallen on the neck of Jane Seymour, 
if she had lived much longer. 

Cranmer had done what he could to save some 
of the Church property for purposes of religion 
and education; but, the great families had been so 
hungry to get hold of it, that very little could be 
rescued for such objects. Even Miles Covbrdale, 
who did the people the inestimable service of trans- 
lating the Bible into English (which the unreformed 
religion never permitted to be done), was left in 
poverty while the great families clutched the Church 
lands and money* The people had been told that 
when the Crown came into possession of these funds-

it would not; be accessary to tax them;, bat they 
were taxed afresh directly afterwards. It was for- 
tunate for them., indeed, that so many nobtea were 
so greedy for this wealth; since; if it had remained 
with the Crown , there might have been no end to 
tyranny for hundreds of years. One of the. most 
active writers on: the Church’s side against the. King 
was a member of - his own family — a sort of dis- 
tant cousin, Reginald Pole by name — who at- 
tacked him in the most; violent manner (though he 
received a pension from him all the time); and 
fought for the Church with his pen, day and night. 
As he was beyond the King’s, reach — being in 
Italy — the. King politely invited him over to dis- * 
cuss the subject; but he, knowing better than to 
come, and wisely staying where he was, the King’s 
rage fell upon Ins brother Lard Montague, the Mar- 
quis of Exeter, and some other gentlemen: who 
were tried for high treason in corresponding with 
him, and aiding him — which they probably did 
— and were all executed. The Pope made Regi- 
nald Pole a cardinal; but, so much, against his will, 
that it is thought he even aspired in bia.own mind 
to the vacant throne of England^ and nad hopes 
of marrying the Princess Mary. His being made, a 
high priest, however., put an end to ell that. His 
mother, the venerable Countess of Salishuiy, who 
was , unfortunately for; herself, within, the: tyrant’s 
reach, wax the last of hia relatives on whom his 
wrath fell. When she was told to lay her grey head 
upon the bloek, she answered the executioner, “No! 
My head never committed treason, and if you want

it, 70a shall seize it” So, she ran round and round 
the scaffold with the executioner striking at her, and 
her grey hair bedabbled with blood; and even when 
they held her down upon the block she mored her 
head about to the last, resolved to be no party to 
her own barbarous murder. All this the people bore, 
as they had borne everything else. 

Indeed they bore much more; for the slow fires 
of Smithfield were continually burning, and people 
were constantly being roasted to death — still to 
show what a good Christian the King Iras. He de- 
fied the Pope and his Bull, which was now issued, 
and had come into England; but he burned innu- 
merable people whose only offence was that they 
differed from the Pope’s religious opinions. There 
was a Wretched man named Lambert among others, 
who was tried for this before the King, and with 
whom six bishops argued one after another. When 
he was quite exhausted (as well he might be, after 
six bishops) be threw himself on the King’s mercy; 
but the King blustered out that he had no mercy 
for heretics. So, he too fed the fire. 

All this the people bore, and more than all this 
yet The national spirit seems to have been banish- 
ed from the kingdom at this time. The very 
people who were executed for treason, the very 
wires and friends of the “bluff” King, spoke of 
Mm on the scaffold as a good prince, and a gentle 
prince — just as serfs in similar circumstances have 
been known to do, under the Sultan and Bashaws 
of the East, or under the fierce old tyrants of Rus- 
sia, who poured boiling and freezing water on them

alternately, until they died. The Parliament were 
as bad as the rest, and gave the King whatever he 
wanted; among other vile accommodations, they 
gave him new powers of murdering at his will and 
pleasure, any one whom he might choose to call a 
traitor. But the worst measure they passed was an 
Act of Six Articles, commonly called at the time 
“the whip with six strings;” which punished offences 
against the Pope’s opinions without mercy, and en- 
forced the very worst parts of the monkish religion. 
Cranmer would have modified it, if he could; but, 
being overborne by the Romish party, had not the 
power. As one of the articles declared that priests 
should not marry, and as he was married himself, 
he sent his wife and children into Germany, and 
began to tremble at his danger; none the less be- 
cause he was, and had long been, the King’s friend. 
This whip of six strings was made under the King’s 
own eye. It should never be forgotten of him how 
cruelly he supported the worst of the Popish doc- 
trines when there was nothing to be got by oppo- 
sing them. 

This amiable monarch now thought of taking 
another wife. He proposed to the French King to 
have some of the ladies of the French Court exhi- 
bited before him, that he might make his Royal 
choice; but the French King answered that he would 
rather not have his ladies trotted out to be shown 
like horses at a fair. He proposed to the Dowager 
Duchess of Milan, who replied that she might have 
thought of such a match if she had had two heads; 
but, that only owning one, she must beg to keep

it safe. At last Cromwell represented that there 
was a Protestant princess in Germany — those 
who held the reformed religion were called Pro- 
testants, because their leaders had Protested against 
the abuses and impositions of the unreformed Church 
•—named Aims op Cleves, who was beautiful, 
and would answer the purpose admirably. The 
King said was she a large woman, because he 
must have a fat wife? “0 yes,” said Cromwell; 
“she, was very large — just the thing.” On hear- 
ing this the King sent over his famous painter, 
Hans Holbein, to take her portrait. Hans made 
her out to be so good-looking that the King was 
satisfied and the marriage arranged. But, whether 
anybody had paid Hans to touch up the picture; 
or whether Hans, like one or two other painters, 
flattered a princess in the ordinary way of business, 
I cannot say; all I know is, that when Anne came 
over and the King went to Bochester to meet her, 
and first saw her without her seeing him, he swore 
she was a great Flanders mare, and said he would 
never marry her. Being obliged to do it, now 
matters had gone so far, he would not give her the 
presents he had prepared, and would never notice 
her; and he never forgave Cromwell his part in 
the affair. His downfall dates from that time. 

It was quickened by his enemies in the interests 
of the unreformed religion, putting in the King’s 
vay, at a state dinner, a niece of the Duke of 
Norfolk, Catherine Howard, a young lady of 
fascinating manners, though small in stature and 
not particularly beautiful. Falling in love with

her on the spot, the King soon divorced Anne of 
Cleves after making her the subject of much brutal 
talk, on pretence that she had been previously be- 
trothed so some one else — which would never do 
for one of his dignity — and married Catherine. 
It is probable that on his wedding-day , of all days 
in the year, he sent his faithful Cromwell to the 
scaffold, and had his head struck off. Be further 
celebrated the occasion by burning at one time, 
and causing to be drawn to the fire on the same 
hurdles, some Protestant prisoners for denying the 
Pope’s doctrines, and some Roman Catholie pri- 
soners for denying his own supremacy. Still the 
people bore it, and not a gentleman in England 
raised bis band. 

But, by a just retribution, it soon came out 
that Catherine Howard, before her marriage, had 
been really guilty of such crimes as the King had 
falsely attributed to his second wife Anne Boleyn; 
so, again the dreadful axe made the King a wi- 
dower, and this Queen passed away as so many in 
that reign had passed away before her. As an ap- 
propriate pursuit under the circumstances , Henry 
then applied himself to superintending the compo- 
sition of a religious book called “A necessary 
doctrine for any Christian Man.” He must have 
been a little confused in his mind, I think, at about 
this period -, for he was so false to himself as to be 
true to some one: that some one being Cranmer, 
whom the Duke of Norfolk and others of his enemies 
tried to ruin, but to whom the King was stedfast, 
and to whom he one night gave his ring, charging

him when he should find himself, next day, ac- 
cused of treason, to show it to the council board. 
This, Cranmer did to the eo&ftwion of bis enemies. 
I suppose the King thought he might went him a 
little longer. 

He married yet once more. Tes. Strange to 
say, he found in England another woman who 
would become his wife, and she was Catherine 
Parr, widow of Lord Latimer. She leaned to- 
wards the reformed religion-, and, it is some com- 
fort to know, that she tormented the King con- 
siderably by arguing a variety of doctrinal points 
with him on all possible occasions. She had very 
nearly done this to her own destruction. After one 
of these conversations, the King in a very black 
mood actually instructed GinoDOm, one of his bi- 
shops who favoured the Popish opinions , to draw 
a bill of accusation against her, which would have 
inevitably have brought her to the scaffold where 
her predecessors had died, but that one of her 
friends picked up the paper of instructions, which 
had been dropped in the palace , and gave her 
timely notice. She fell ill with terror, but managed 
the King so well when he came to entrap her into 
forther statements, by saying that she had only 
spoken on such points to divert his mind and to 
get some information from his extraordinary wis- 
dom, that be gave her a kiss and called her his 
sweetheart. And , when the Chancellor came next 
day, actually to take her to the Tower, the King 
sent him about his business , and honored him with 
the epithets of a beast, a knave, and a fool. So

near was Catherine Parr to the block, and so nar- 
_ now was her escape! 

There was war with Scotland in this reign, and 
a short clumsy war with France for favoring Scot- 
land; but, the events at home were so dreadful, 
and leave such an enduring stain on the country, 
that I need say no more of what happened abroad.' 

A few more horrors, and this reign is over. 
There was a lady, Anne Askew, in Lincolnshire, 
who inclined to the Protestant opinions, and whose 
husband, being a fierce Catholic, turned her out 
of his house. She came to London, and was con- 
sidered as offending against the six articles, and 
was taken to the Tower, and put upon the rack. 
— probably because it was hoped that she might 
in her agony criminate some obnoxious persons; if 
falsely, so much the better. She was tortured with- 
out uttering a cry, until the Lieutenant of the 
Tower would suffer his men to torture her no 
more; and then two priests who were present ac- 
tually pulled off their robes and turned the wheels 
^of the rack with their own hands, so rending and 
twisting and breaking her that she was afterwards 
carried to the fire in a chair. She was burned 
with three others, a gentleman, a clergyman, and 
a tailor; and so the world went on. 

Either the King became afraid of the power of 
the Duke of Norfolk, and his son the Earl of Sur- 
rey, or they gave him some offence, but he re- 
solved to pull them down, to follow all the rest 
who were gone. The son was tried first — of 
course for nothing — and defended himself bravely;

but of course be was found guilty, and of course 
he was executed. Then his father was laid hold 
of, and left for death too. 

But the King himself was left for death too, by 
a Greater King, and the earth was to be rid of 
him at last. He was nowa swollen, beastly, hideous 
spectacle, with a great hole in his leg, and so 
odious to every sense that it was dreadful to ap- 
proach him. When he was found to be dying, 
Cranmer was sent for from his palace at Croydon, 
and came with all speed, but found him speechless. 
Happily, in that hour he perished. He was in the 
fifty-sixth year of his age, and the thirty-eighth 
of his reign*. 

Henry the Eighth has been favored by some 
Protestant writers, because the Reformation was 
achieved in his time. But the mighty merit of it 
lies with other men and not with him, and it can 
be rendered none the worse by this monster’s crimes, 
and none the better by any defence of them. The 
plain truth is, that he was a most intolerable ruffian, 
a disgrace to human nature, and a blot of blood 
and grease upon the History of England. 


CHAPTER XXIX. 

ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SIXTH. 

Henry the eighth had made a will, appointing 
a council of sixteen to govern the kingdom for his 
son, while he was under age (he was now only

ten years old), and another council of twelve to 
help them*. The most powerful of the first council 
was the Earl op Hertford, the young Bang’s 
uncle, who lost no time in bringing his nephew 
with great state up to Enfield, and thenee to the 
Tower* It was considered at the time a striking 
proof of virtue in the young King that he was 
sorry for his father’s death ; but, as common sub- 
jects have that virtue, too, sometimes, we will say 
no more about it. 

There was a curious part of the late King’s 
will, requiring his executors to fulfil whatever pro- 
mises he had made. Some of the court wondering 
what these might be, the Earl of Hertford and the 
other noblemen interested, said that they were pro- 
mises to advance and enrich them . So, the Earl of 
Hertford made himself Duke of Somerset, and 
made his brother Edward Seymour a baron; and 
there were various similar promotions, all very 
agreeable to the parties concerned, and very duti- 
ful, no doubt, to the late King’s memory. To be 
more dutiful still, they made themselves rich out 
of the Church lands, and were very comfortable* 
The new Duke of Somerset caused himself to be 
declared Protector of the kingdom, and was, in- 
deed, the king. 

As young Edward the Sixth had been brought 
up in the principles of the Protestant religion, 
everybody knew that they would be maintained. 
But Cranmer, to whom they were chiefly entrusted, 
advanced them steadily and temperately. Many 
superstitious and ridiculous practices were stopped,

but those which were harmless were not interfered 
with. 

The Dike of Somerset, the Protector, was 
anxious to have the young King engaged in mar* 
riage to the young Queen of Scotland, in order to 
prevent that princess from making m alliance with 
an y foreign power; bit, as a large party in Scot- 
land were unfavourable to this plan he invaded 
that country. His excuse for so doing was, that 
the Border men — that is, the Scotch who lived in 
that part of the country where England and Scot' 
land joined — troubled the English very much. 
But there were two sides to this question, for the 
English Border men troubled the Scotch too; and 
through many long years there were perpetual 
border quarrels which gave rise to numbers of old 
tales and songs. However, the Protector invaded 
Scotland, and Arran, the Scottish Regent, with an 
army twice as large as his, advanced to meet him. 
They encountered on the banks of the river Esk, 
within a few miles of Edinburgh; and there, after 
a little .skirmish , the Protector made such moderate 
proposals , in offering to retire if the Scotch would 
only engage not to marry their princess to any 
foreign prince, that the Regent thought the Eng- 
lish were afraid. But in this he made a horrible 
mistake; for the English soldiers on land, and the 
English sailors on the water, so set Upon the 
Scotch, that they broke and fled, And more than 
ten thousand of them were killed* It was a dread- 
ful battle, for the fugitives were slain without 
mercy. The ground for four miles, all the way to

Edinburgh, was strewn with dead men, and with 
arms, and legs, and beads. Some, bid themselves 
in streams and were drowned; some, threw away 
their armour and were killed running, almost naked; 
but in this battle of Pinkey the English lost only 
two or three hundred men. They were much better 
clothed than the Scotch, and were exceedingly 
astonished by the poverty of their appearance and 
of their country. 

A Parliament was called when Somerset came 
back, and it repealed the whip with six strings, 
and did one or two other good things, though it 
unhappily retained the punishment of burning, for 
those people who did not make believe to believe, 
in all religious matters, what the Government had 
declared that they must and should believe. It also 
made a foolish law (meant to put down beggars), 
that any man who lived idly and loitered about, 
for three days together, should be burned with a 
hot iron, made a slave, and wear an iron fetter. 
But this savage absurdity soon came to an end, 
and went the way of a great many other foolish laws. 

The Protector was now so proud that he sat in 
Parliament, before all the nobles, on the right 
hand of the throne. Many other noblemen, who 
only wanted to be as proud if they could get a 
chance, became his enemies of course, and it is 
supposed that he came back suddenly from Scot- 
land because he had received news that his brother, 
Lord Seymour, was becoming dangerous to him. 
This lord was now High Admiral of England: a 
very handsome man, and a great favorite with the

Court ladies — even with the young Princess 
Elizabeth , who romped with him a little more than 
young princesses in these times do with any one. 
He had married Catherine Parr, the late King’s 
widow, who was now dead; and to strengthen his 
power he secretly supplied the young King with 
money. He may even have engaged with some of 
his brother’s enemies in a plot to carry the boy 
off. On these and other accusations, at any rate, 
he was confined in the Tower, impeached, and 
found guilty; his own brother’s name being — un- 
natural and sad to tell — the first signed to the 
warrant for his execution. He was executed on 
Tower Hill, and died denying his treason. One 
of his last proceedings in this world was to write 
two letters: one to the Princess Elizabeth, and one 
to the Princess Mary: which a servant of his took 
charge of, and concealed in his shoe. These letters 
are supposed to have urged them against his brother, 
and to revenge his death. What they truly con- 
tained is not known, but there is no doubt that he 
had, at one time, obtained great influence over the 
Princess Elizabeth. 

All this while , the Protestant religion was making 
progress. The images which the people had gra- 
dually come to worship, were removed from the 
churches; the people were informed that they need 
not confess themselves to priests unless they chose; 
a common prayer-book was drawn up in the Eng- 
lish language, which all could understand; and 
many other improvements were made: still mo- 
derately, for Cranmer was a very moderate man,

and even restrained the Protestant clergy from 
violently abusing the unreformed religion — as 
they very often did, and which was not a good 
example. But* the people were at this time in great 
distress. The rapacious nobility who had eome 
into possession of the Church lands, were very 
bad landlords. They enclosed great quantities of 
ground for the feeding of sheep, which was tta 
more profitable than the growing of crops; 
this increased the general distress. So the people, 
who still understood little of what was going on 
about them and still readily believed what the hoffio* 
less monks told them — many of whom had bow 
their good friends in their better days — took it 
into their heads, that all this was owing to there- 
formed religion, and therefore rose in many-parts 
of the country. 

The most powerful risings were in Devonshire 
and Norfolk. In Devonshire, the rebellion was W 
strong that ten thousand men united within a fe* 
days, and even laid siege to Exeter. But Lo$i> 
Russell, coming to tho assistance of the citizen 8 
who defended that town, defeated the rebels* 
not only hanged the Mayor of one place, but hanged 
tho vicar of another from his own church steeple. 
What with hanging and killing by the sword, few 
thousand of the rebels are supposed to have folk® 
in that one county. In Norfolk (where the rising 
was more against the inclosure of open lands thus 
against the reformed religion), the popular leads* 
was a man named Robert Ret, a tanner of Tfj m 
mondham. The mob were in the first instance.

dted against the tanner by one John Flowerdbw, 
a gentleman, who owed him a' grudge; but, the tan- 
ner was more than a match for the gentleman, since 
is soon got the people on his side, and established 
himself, near Norwich with quite an army. There 
was a large oak-tree in that place, on a spot called 
Mbushold Hill, which Ket named the Tree of Re- 
formation ; and under its green boughs, he and his 
men sat, in the Midsummer weather, holding courts 
of justice and debating affairs of state. They were 
impartial enough to allow some rather thresome 
public speakers to get up into this Tree of Refor- 
mation, and point out their errors to them, in long 
discourses, while they lay listening (not always 
without gome grumbling and growling) in the shade 
Wow. At last, one sunny July day, a herald 
appeared below the tree, and proclaimed Ket and 
*11 his men traitors, unless from that moment they 
Aspersed and went home; in which case they were 
to receive a pardon. But, Ket and his men made 
%ht of the herald and became stronger than ever, 
uatil the Earl of Warwick went after them with a 
sufficient force , and cut them all to pieces. A few 
hanged, drawn, and quartered as traitors, and 
fteir limbs were sent into various country places to 
to a terror to tbepeople. Nine of them were banged 
upon nine green branches of the Oak of Reformation ; 
*&d so, for the time, that tree may be said to have 
withered away. 

The Protector, though a haughty man, had 
impassion for the real distresses of the common 
People, and a sincere desire to help them. But he

was too proud and too high in degree to hold even 
their favor steadily, and many of the nobles always 
envied and hated him, because they were as proud 
and not as high as he. He was at this time build- 
ing a great Palace in the Strand, to get the stone 
for which he blew up church steeples with gun- 
'powder, and pulled down bishops’ houses; thus 
making himself still more disliked. At length, his 
principal enemy, the Earl of Warwick — Dudley 
by name, and the son of that Dudley, who had 
made himself so odious with Empson, in the reign 
of Henry the Seventh — joined with seven other 
members of the Council against him, formed a se- 
parate Council, and becoming stronger in a few 
days, sent him to the Tower under twenty-nine ar- 
ticles of accusation. After being sentenced by the 
Council to the forfeiture of all his offices and lands, 
he was liberated and pardoned, on making a very 
humble submission, He was even taken back into 
the Council again, after having suffered this fall, 
and married his daughter, Lady Anne Seymour, 
to Warwick’s eldest son. But such a reconciliation 
was little likely to last, and did not outlive a year. 
Warwick having got himself made Duke of North- 
umberland, and having advanced the more important 
of his friends, then finished the history by causing 
the Duke of Somerset and his friend Lord Obey, 
and others, to be arrested for treason, in having 
conspired to seize and dethrone the King. They 
were also accused of having intended to seize the 
new Duke of Northumberland, with his friends Lord 
Northampton and Lord Pembroke; to murder them

if they found need; and to raise the City to revolt. 
All this the fallen Protector positively denied, ex- 
cept that he confessed to having spoken of the 
murder of those three noblemen, but having never 
designed it. He was acquitted of the charge of 
treason, and found guilty of the other charges; so 
when the people — who remembered his having 
been their friend, now that he was disgraced and 
in danger — saw him come out from his trial 
with the axe turned from him, they thought he 
was altogether acquitted, and set up a loud shout 
of joy. 

But the Duke of Somerset was ordered to be 
beheaded on Tower Hill, at eight o’clock in the 
morning, and proclamations were issued bidding 
the citizens keep at home until after ten. They 
filled the streets, however, and crowded the place 
of execution as soon as it was light, and, with sad 
faces and sad hearts, saw the once powerful Pro- 
tector ascend the scaffold to lay his head upon the 
dreadful block. While he was yet saying his last 
words to them with manly courage, and telling 
them, in particular, how it comforted him, at that 
pass, to have assisted in reforming the national 
religion, a member of the council was seen riding 
up on horseback. They again thought that the 
Duke was saved by his bringing a reprieve, and 
again shouted for joy. But the Duke himself told 
them they were mistaken, and laid down his head 
and had it struck off at a blow. 

Many of the bystanders rushed forward and 
steeped their handkerchiefs in his blood, as a mark

of their affection. He had, indeed, been capable of 
many good acts, and one of them was discovered 
after he was no more. The Bishop of Durham , a 
very good man, had been informed against to the 
Council when the Duke was in power, as having 
answered a treacherous letter proposing a rebellion 
against the reformed religion. As the answer could 
not be found, he could not he declared guilty*, but 
it was now discovered, hidden by the Duke himself 
among some prfrate papers , in his regard for that 
good man. The Bishop lost his office, and was 
deprived of his possessions. 

It is not very pleasant to know that while his 
uncle lay in prison under sentence of death, the 
young King was being vastly entertained by plays, 
and dances, and sham fights; but there is no doubt 
of it, for he kept a journal himself. It is pleasanter 
to know that not a single Roman Catholic was burnt 
in this reign for holding that religion, though two 
wretched victims suffered for heresy. One, a woman 
named Joan Bocher, for professing some opinions 
that even she could only explain in unintelligible 
jargon. The other, a Dutchman, named Yon Pams, 
who practised as a surgeon in London. Edward 
was, to Ms credit, exceedingly unwilling to sign 
the warrant for the Roman’s execution; shedding 
tears before he did so, and telKng Cranmer, who 
urged him to it (though Cranmer really would have 
spared the woman at first, but for her own deter- 
mined obstinacy) that the guilt was not his, but 
that of the man who so strongly urged the dreadful 
act. We shall see too soon, whether the time ever

came when Cranmer is likely to have remembered 
this with sorrow and remorse. 

Cranmer and Ridley (at first Bishop of Ro- 
chester, and afterwards Bishop of London) were 
the moat powerful of the clergy of this reign. Others 
were imprisoned and deprived of their property for 
still adhering to the unreformed religion; the most 
important among whom were Gardiner, Bishop of 
Winchester, Heath, Bishop of Worcester, Da t. 
Bishop of Chichester, aud Bonner, that Bishop of 
London who was superseded by Ridley. The Prin- 
cess Mary, who inherited her mother’s gloomy tem- 
per, and hated the reformed religion as connected 
with her mother’s wrongs and sorrows — she knew 
nothing else about it, always refusing to read a 
single book in which it was truly described — held 
by the unreformed religion too, and was the only 
person in the kingdom for whom the old Mass was 
allowed to be performed; nor would the young King 
have made that exception even in her favour; but 
for. the strong persuasions of Cranmer and Ridley. 
He always viewed it with horror; and when he fell 
into a sickly condition, after having been very ill, 
first of the measles and then of the small -pox, he 
was greatly troubled in mind to think that if he 
died and she the next heir to the throne succeeded, 
the Roman Catholic religion would be set up again. 

This uneasiness, the Duke of Northumberland 
was not slow to encourage: for, if the Princess 
Mary came to the throne, he who had taken part 
with the Protestants was sure to be disgraced. Now, 
the Duchess of Suffolk was descended from King

Henry the Seventh, and if she resigned what little 
or no right she had, in favor of her daughter. 
Lady Jane Grey, that would be the succession to 
promote the Duke’s greatness; because Lord Guil- 
ford Dudley, one of his sons, was, at this very 
time, newly married to her. So, he worked upon 
the King’s fears, and persuaded him to set aside 
both the Princess Mary and the Princess Elizabeth, 
and assert his right to appoint his successor. Accord- 
ingly the young King handed to the Crown lawyers 
a writing signed half-a-dozen times over by himself 
appointing Lady Jane Grey to succeed to the Crown, 
and requiring them to have his will made out accord- 
ing to law. They were much against it at first and 
told the King so ; but the Duke of Northumberland 
being so violent about it that the lawyers even ex- 
pected him to beat them, and hotly declaring that 
stripped to his shirt he would fight any man in 
such a quarrel, they yielded. Cranmer, also, at 
first hesitated, pleading that he had sworn to main- 
tain the succession of the Crown to the Princess 
Mary; but, he was a weak man in his resolutions, 
and soon signed the document with the rest of the 
council. 

It was completed none too soon, for Edward 
was now sinking in a rapid decline, and by way 
of making him better, they handed him over to a 
woman-doctor who pretended to be able to cure it 
He soon got worse. On the sixth of July, in the 
year one thousand five hundred and fifty-three, he 
died, very peaceably and piously; praying God, 
with his last breath, to protect the reformed religion.

This King died in the sixteenth year of his 
age, and in the seventh of his reign. It is difficult 
to judge what the character of one so young might 
afterwards have become, among so many bad, am- 
bitious, quarrelling nobles. But, he was an amiable 
boy, of very good abilities, and had nothing coarse 
or cruel or brutal in his disposition — which in the 
son of such a father is rather surprising. 


CHAPTEB XXX. 

ENGLAND UNDER QUEEN MARY. 

The Duke of Northumberland was very anxious 
to keep the young King’s death a secret, in order 
that he might get the two Princesses into his power. 
But, the Princess Mary, being informed of that event 
as she was on her way to London to see her sick 
brother, turned her horse’s head, and rode away 
into Norfolk. The Earl of Arundel was her friend, 
and it was he who sent her warning of what had 
happened. 

As the secret could not be kept, the Duke of 
Northumberland and the Council sent for the Lord 
Mayor of London and some of the aldermen and 
made a merit of telling it ta them. Then, they 
made it known to the people, and set off to inform 
Lady Jane Grey that she was to be Queen. 

She was a pretty girl of only sixteen, and was 
amiable, learned, and clever. When the lords who 

came to her, fell on their knees before her, and

told her what tidings they brought, she was so 
astonished that she fainted. On recovering, she ex- 
pressed her sorrow for the young King’s death, and 
said that she knew she was unfit to govern the 
kingdom, but, that if she must be Queen, die 
prayed Gk>d to direct her. She was then at Sion 
House, near Brentford, and the lords took her down 
the river in state to the Tower, that she might re- 
main there (as the custom was) until she was crowned. 
But the people were not at all favorable to Lady 
Jane, considering that the right to be Queen was 
Mary’s , and greatly disliking the Duke of North- 
umberland. They were not put into a better humour 
by the Duke’s causing a vintner’s servant, one Ga- 
briel Pot, to be taken up for expressing his dis- 
satisfaction among the crowd, and to have his ears 
nailed to the pillory, and cut off. Some powerful 
men among the nobility declared on Mary’s side. 
They raised troops to support her cause, had her 
proclaimed Queen at Norwich, and gathered around 
y^her at the castle of Framlingham, which belonged 
to the Duke of Norfolk. For she was not considered 
so safe as yet, but that it was best to keep her in / 
a* castle on the sea-coast , from whence she might 
be sent abroad, if necessary. 

The Council would have dispatched Lady Jane’s 
father, the Duke of Suffolk, as the general of the 
army against this force; but as Lady Jane implared * 
that her father might remain with her, and as he 
was known to be but a weak man, they told the 
Duke of Northumberland that he must take the 
command himself. He was not very. ready to do

86, as he mistrusted the Council much, but there 
was no help for it, and he set forth with a heavy 
heart: observing to a lord who rode beside him 
through Shoreditch at tibe head of the troops, that, 
although the people pressed in great numbers to 
look at them, they were terribly silent. 

And his fears for himself turned out to be true. 
While he was waiting at Cambridge for farther help 
from the Council, the Council took it in their heads 
to turn their backs on Lady Jane’s cause, and to 
take up the Princess Mary’s. This was chiefly 
owing to the before -mentioned Earl of Arundel, 
who represented to the Lord Mayor and aldermen, 
h a second interview with those sagacious persons, 
that, as for himself, he did not perceive the Re- 
formed religion to be in much danger — which 
Lord Pembroke backed by flourishing his sword as 
another kind of persuasion. The Lord Mayor and 
aldermen, thus enlightened, said, there could be no 
doubt that the Princess Mary ought to be Queen. 
So, she was proclaimed at the Cross by St. Paul^ 
and barrels of wine were given to the people, and 
they got very drunk, and danced round blazing 
bonfires — little thinking, poor wretches ; what 
other bonfires would soon be blazing in Queen 
Mary’s name I 

After a fen days’ dream of royalty, Lady Jane 
Grey resigned the Crown with great willingness, 
saying that she had only accepted it in obedience 
to her f&ther and mother; and went gladly back to 
her pleasant house by the river, and her books. 
Mary then came on towards London; and at Wan-

stead, in Essex, was joined by her half sister, the 
Prineess Elizabeth. They passed through the streets 
of London to the Tower , and there the new Queen 
met some eminent prisoners then confined in it, 
kissed them, and gave them their liberty. Among 
these were that Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, 
who had been imprisoned in the last reign for 
holding to the unreformed religion. Him she soon 
made chancellor. 

The Duke of Northumberland had been taken 
prisoner, and, together with his son and five others, 
was quickly brought before the Council. He, not 
unnaturally, asked that Council, in his defence, 
whether it was treason to obey orders that had been 
issued under the great seal, and if it were, whether 
they, who had obeyed them too, ought to be his 
judges? But they made light of these points, and, 
being resolved to have him out of the way, soon 
sentenced him to death. He had risen into power 
upon the death of another man, and made but a 
< poor show (as might be expected) when he himself 
lay low. He entreated Gardiner to let him live, if 
it were only in a mouse’s hole; and when he as- 
cended the scaffold to be beheaded on Tower Hill, 
addressed the people in a miserable way, saying 
that he had been incited by others, and exhorting 
them to return to the unreformed religion, which 
he told them was his faith. There seems reason to 
suppose that he expected a pardon even then, in 
return for this confession; but it matters little whe- 
ther ho did or not. His head was struck off, and

Sir John Gates and Sir Thomas Palmer, two better 
and more manly gentlemen, suffered with him. 

Mary was now crowned Queen. She was thirty- 
seven years of age, short and thin, wrinkled in the 
face, and very unhealthy. But she had a great liking 
for show and for bright colours, and all the ladies 
of her Court were magnificently dressed. She had a 
great liking too for old customs, without much sense 
in them; and she was oiled in the oldest way, and 
blessed in the oldest way, and done all manner of 
things to in the oldest way, at her coronation. I 
hope they did her good. 

She soon began to show her desire to put down 
the Reformed religion, and put up the unreformed 
one: though it was dangerous work as yet* the 
people being something wiser than they used to 
be. They even cast a shower of stones — and 
among them a dagger — at one of the royal chap- 
lains, who attacked the Reformed religion in a pub- 
lic sermon. But, the Queen and her' priests went 
steadily on. Ridley, the powerful bishop of the 
last reign, was seized and sent to the Tower. La- 
timer, also a celebrated prelate of the last reign, 
was likewise sent to the Tower, and Cranmer 
speedily followed. Latimer was an aged man; and 
as his guards took him through Smithfield, he 
looked round it, and said, “This is a place that 
bath long groaned for me.” For he knew well, 
what kind of bonfires would soon be burning. Nor 
was the knowledge confined to him. The prisons 
were fast filled with the chief Protestants, who 
were there left rotting in darkness, hunger, dirt*

and separation from their friends; many, who had 
time left them for escape, fled from the kingdom; 
and the dullest of the people began* now, to see 
what was coming. 

It came on fast. A Parliament was got together, 1 
not without strong suspicion of unfairness, and they 
annulled the divorce, formerly pronounced by Cran- 
mer between the Queen’s mother and King Heniy 
the Eighth , and unmade all the laws on the sub- 
ject of religion that had been made in the last King 
Edward’s reign. They began their proceedings in 
violation of the law, by having the old mass said 
before them in Latin, and by turning out a bishop 
who would not kneel down. They also declared 
guilty of treason Lady Jane Grey, for aspiring to 
the Crown, her husband, for being her husband, 
and Cranmer for not believing in the mass aforesaid. 
They then prayed the Queen graciously to choose 
a husband for herself, as soon as might be. 

Now, the question who should be the Queens 
husband had given rise to a great deal of discus- 
sion, and to several contending parties. Some said 
Cardinal Pole was the man — but the Queen was 
of opinion that he was not the man, being too old 
and too much of a student. Others said that the 
gallant young Courtenay, whom the Queen had 
. made Earl of Devonshire, was the man — and the 
Queen thought so too, for a while, but she changed 
her mind. At last it appeared that Philip, P kdXCB 
op Spain, was certainly the man — • though cer- 
tainly not the people’s man, for they detested the 
idea of such a marriage from the beginning to the

end, and murmured that the Spaniard would estab- 
lish in England, by the aid of foreign soldiers, the 
worst abuses of the Popish religion, and even the 
terrible Inquisition itself. 

These discontents gave rise to a conspiracy for 
marrying young Courtenay to the Princess Eliza- 
beth, and setting them up, with popular tumults 
all over the kingdom, against the Queen. This was 
discovered in time by Gardiner' but in Kent, the 
old bold county, the people rose in their old bold 
way. Sir Thomas Wyat, a man of great daring, 
was their leader. He raised his standard at Maid- 
stone, marched on to Kochester, established himself 
in die old castle there, and prepared to hold out 
against the Duke of Norfolk, who came against him 
with a part of the Queen’s guards and a body of 
five hundred London men. The London men, how- 
ever, were all for Elizabeth, and not at all for 
Mary. They declared, under the castle walls, for 
Wyat; the Duke retreated; and Wyat came on to 
Deptforth, at the head of fifteen thousand men. 

But these, in their turn, fell away. When he 
came to Southwark, there were only two thousand 
left. Not dismayed by finding the London citizens 
in arms, and the guns at the Tower ready to op- 
pose Ms crossing the river there, Wyat led them 
off to Kingston -upon -Thames, intending to cross 
file bridge that he knew to be in that place, and 
bo to work his way round to Ludgate, one of the 
old gates of the City. He found the bridge broken 
down, but mended it, and came across, and bravely 
fought his way up Fleet Street to Ludgate HilL

Finding the gate closed Against him, he fought his 
way back again, sword in hand, to Temple Bar. 
Here, being overpowered, he surrendered himself, 
and three or four hundred of his men were taken, 
besides a hundred killed. Wyat, in a moment of 
weakness (and perhaps of torture) was afterwards 
made to accuse the Princess Elizabeth as his ac- 
complice to some very small extent. But his man- 
hood soon returned to him, and he refused to save 
his life by making any more false confessions. He 
was quartered and distributed in the usual brutal 
way, and from fifty to a hundred of his followers 
were hanged. The rest were led out, with halters 
round their necks, to be pardoned, and to make a 
parade of crying out, “God save Queen Mary!” 

In the danger of this rebellion, the Queen 
showed herself to be a woman of courage and spirit 
She disdained to retreat to any place of safety, and 
went down to the Guildhall, sceptre in hand, and 
made a gallant speech to the Lord Mayor and ci- 
tizens. But on the day after Wyat’s defeat, she did 
the most cruel act, even of her cruel reign, in signing 
the warrant for the execution of Lady Jane Grey. 

They tried to persuade Lady Jane to accept 
the unreformed religion, but she steadily refused. 
On the morning when she was to die, she saw 
from her window the bleeding and headless body 
of her husband, brought back in a cart from the 
scaffold on Tower Hill where he had laid down his 
life. But, as she had declined to see him before 
his execution, lest she should be overpowered and 
not make a good end, so, she even now showed a

constancy and calmness that will never be for- 
gotten* She came np to the scaffold with a firm 
step and a quiet face, and addressed the bystanders 
in a steady voice. They were not numerous, for 
she was too young, too innocent and fair, to be 
murdered before the people on Tower Hill, as her 
husband had just been: so, the place of her exe- 
cution was within the Tower itself. She said that 
she bad done an unlawful act in taking what was 
Queen Mary’s right, but that she had done so with 
no bad intent, and that she died a humble Christian. 
She begged the executioner to despatch her quickly, 
and she asked him “Will you take my head off 
before I lay me down?” He answered, “No, Ma- 
dam ,” and then she was very quiet while they 
bandaged her eyes. Being blinded, and unable to 
see the block on which she was to lay her young 
head, she was seen to feel about for it with her 
hands, and was heard to say, confused, “0 what 
shall I do! Where is it?” Then they guided her to 
the right place, and the executioner struck off her 
head. You know too well, now, what dreadful 
deeds the executioner did in England, through 
many, many years, and how his axe descended on 
the hateful block through the necks of some of the 
bravest, wisest, and best in the land. But it never 
struck so cruel and so vile a blow as this. 

The father of Lady Jane soon followed, but 
was little pitied. Queen Mary’s next object was to 
lay hold of Elizabeth, and this was pursued with 
great eagerness. Five hundred men were sent to 
her retired house at Ashridge, by Berkhampstead,

with orders to bring her up, alive or dead. T hey 
got there at ten at night, when she was sick in 
bed. But, their leaders followed her lady into her 
bedchamber, whence she was brought out betimes 
next morning, and put into a litter to be conveyed 
to London. She was so weak and ill, that she 
was five days on the road; still, she was so re- 
solved to be seen by the people that she had the 
curtains of the litter opened, and so, very pels 
and sickly, passed through the streets. She wrote 
to her sister, saying she was innocent of any 
crime, and asking why she was made a prisoner; 
but she got no answer and was ordered to the 
Tower. They took her in by the Traitor’s 
to which she objected, but in vain. One of die 
lords who conveyed her offered to cover her with 
his cloak, as it was raining, but she put it away 
from her, proudly and scornfully, and passed into 
the Tower, and sat down in a court-yard on a 
stone. They besought her to come in out of the 
wet, but she answered that it was better sitting 
there, than in a worse place. At length she went 
to her apartment, where she was kept a prisoner, 
though not so close a prisoner as at Woodstock, 
whither she was afterwards removed, and whew 
she is said to have one day envied a milkmaid 
whom she heard singing in the sunshine as sh 0 
went through the green fields. Gardiner, than whom 
there were not many worse men among the 
add sullen priests, cared little to keep secret his 
stern desire for her death: being used to say that 
it was of little service to shake off the leaves, and

lop the branches of the tree of heresy, if its root, 
the hope of heretics , were left. He failed, how- 
ever, in his benevolent design. Elizabeth was, at 
length, released, and Hatfield House was assigned 
to her as a residence, under the care of one Sir 
Taomas Pope. 

It would seem that Philip, the Prince of Spain, 
was a main cause of this change in Elizabeth’s for- 
tunes. He was not an amiable man, being, on the 
contrary, proud, overbearing and gloomy, but he 
and the Spanish lords who came over with him, 
assuredly did discountenance the idea of doing any 
violence to the Princess. It may have been prudent, 
but we will hope it was manly and honorable. The 
Queen had been expecting her husband with great 
impatience, and at length he came, to her great 
joy though he never cared much for her. They 
were married by Gardiner, at Winchester, and 
there was more holiday-making among the people; 
but they had their old distrust of this Spanish mar- 
riage, in which even the Parliament shared. Though 
they were far from honest, and were strongly sus- 
pected to have been bought with Spanish money, 
they would pass no bill to enable the Queen to set 
aside the Princess Elizabeth and appoint her own 
successor. 

Although Gardiner failed in this object, as well 
as in the darker one of bringing the Princess to 
file scaffold, he went on, at a great pace, in the re- 
vival of the unreformed religion. A new Parliament 
was packed, in which there were no Protestants. 
Preparations wore made to receive Cardinal P ole

in England as tlie Pope’s messenger, bringing his 
holy declaration that all the nobility who had ac- 
quired Church property, should keep it — which 
was done to enlist their selfish interest on the 
Pope’s side. Then a great scene was enacted, which 
was the triumph of the Queen’s plans. Cardinal 
Pole arrived with great splendor and dignity, and 
was received with great pomp. The Parliament 
joined in a petition expressive of their sorrow at 
the change in the national religion, and praying 
him to receive the country again into the Popish 
Church. With the Queen sitting on her throne, and 
the King on one side of her , and the Cardinal on 
the other, and the Parliament present, Gardiner 
read the petition aloud. The Cardinal then made 
a great speech, and was so obliging as to say that, 
all was forgotten and forgiven, and that the king- 
dom was solemnly made Roman Catholic again. 

Everything was now ready for the lighting of 
the terrible bonfires. The Queen having declared 
to the Council, in writing, that she would wish 
none of her subjects to be burnt without some of 
the Council being present, and that she would par- 
ticulary wish there to be good sermons at all 
burnings, the Council knew pretty well what was 
to be done next. So, after the Cardinal had bles- 
sed all the bishops as a preface to the burnings, 
the Chancellor Gardiner opened a High Court at 
Saint Mary Overy, on the Southwark side of Lon- 
don Bridge, for the trial of heretics. Here, two of 
the late bishops, Hooper and Rogers, who had 
been already unjustly and violently examined be-

fore the Council, were brought to be tried. Hooper 
was tried first for being married, though a priest, 
and for not believing in the mass. He admitted 
both of these accusations, and said that the mass 
was a wicked imposition. Then they tried Bogers, 
who said the same. Next morning the two were 
brought up to be sentenced, and then Bogers said 
that, his poor wife being a German woman and a 
stranger in the land, he hoped she might be allowed 
to come to speak to him before he died. To this 
the inhuman Gardiner replied, that she was not 
his wife. “Tea, but she is, my lord,’* said Bogers, 
“and she hath been my wife these eighteen years.” 
His request was still refused, and they were both 
sent to Newgate; all those who stood in the streets 
to sell things, being ordered to put out their lights 
that the people might not see them. But, the peo- 
ple stood at their doors with candles in their hands, 
and prayed for them as they went by. Soon after- 
wards, Bogers was taken out of jail to be burnt in 
Smithfield; and, in the crowd as he went along, he 
saw his poor wife and his ten children, of whom 
the youngest was a little baby. And so he was 
burnt to death. 

The next day, Hooper, who was to be burnt at 
Gloucester, was brought out to take his last jour- 
ney, and was made to wear a hood over his face 
that he might not be known by the people. But, 
they did know him for all that, down in his own 
part of the country, and when he came near Glou- 
cester they lined die road , making prayers and la- 
mentations. His guards took him to a lodging,

where he slept soundly all night, and at nine 
o’clock next morning was brought forth, leaning 
on a staff; for he had taken cold in prison And 
was infirm. The iron stake, and the iron chain 
which was to bind him to it, were fixed. up near a 
great elm -tree in a pleasant open place before the 
cathedral, where, on peaceful Sundays, he had been 
accustomed to preach and to pray, when he was 
Bishop of Gloucester. This tree, which had no 
leaves then, it being February, was filled with peo- 
ple; and the priests of Gloucester College were 
looking complacently on from a window, and there 
was a great concourse of spectators in every spot 
from which a glimpse of the dreadful sight could 
be beheld. When the old man kneeled down on 
the small platform at the foot of the stake, and 
prayed aloud, the nearest people were observed 
to be so attentive to his prayers that they were 
ordered to stand further back; for it did not suit 
the Romish Church to have those Protestant words 
heard. His prayers concluded, he went up to the 
stake and was stripped to his shirt, and chained 
ready for the fire. One of his guards had such 
compassion on him that, to shorten his agonies, he 
tied some packets of gunpowder about him. Then 
they heaped up wood and straw and reeds, and set 
them all alight. But, unhappily, the wood was 
green and damp, and there was a wind blowing 
that blew what flame there was, away. Thus, 
through three quarters of an hour, the good old 
man was scorched and roasted and smoked, as the 
fire rose and sank; and all that time they saw him,

as he burned, moving his lips in pra year, and beat* 
mg his breast with one hand, even after the other 
*as burnt away and had fallen off. 

Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer were taken to 
Oxford to dispute with a commission of priests 
and doctors about the mass. They were shame- 
fully treated, and it is recorded that the Oxford 
scholars hissed and howled and groaned, and mis- 
conducted themselves in an anything but scholarly 
way — which, of course, they have never done, on 
any public occasion, since. The prisoners were 
taken back to jail, and afterwards tried in St Ma- 
ry’s Church. They were all found guilty. On the 
sixteenth of the month of October, Ridley and La- 
tuner were brought out, to make another of the 
dreadful bonfires. 

The scene of the suffering of these two good 
Protestant men was in the City ditch, near Baliol 
College. On coming to the dreadful spot, they 
kissed the stakes , and then embraced each other. 
And then a learned doctor got up into a pulpit 
which was placed there, and preached a sermon 
from the text “Though I give my body to be 
burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me no- 
thing.” When you think of the charity of burning 
fflsn alive, you may imagine that this learned doc- 
tor had a rather brazen face. Ridley would have 
answered his sermon when it came to an end, but 
wob not allowed. When Latimer was stripped, it 
appeared that he had dressed himself, under his 
°&er clothes, in a new shroud; and, as he stood 
hi it before all the people, it was noted of him, and

long remembered, that, whereas he had been stoop- 
ing and feeble but a few minutes before, he now 
stood upright and handsome, in the knowledge that 
he was dying for a just and a great cause. Rid- 
leyV brother -in -law was there, with bags of gun- 
powder; and when they were both chained up, he 
tied them round their bodies. Then, a light was 
thrown upon the pile to fire it “Be of good com- 
fort, Master Ridley,” said Latimer, at that awful 
moment, “and play the man! We shall this day 
light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, 
as I trust shall never be put out.” And then he 
was seen to make motions with his hands as if he 
were washing them in the flames, and to stroke his 
aged face with them, and was heard to cry: “Fa- 
ther of Heaven, receive my soul!” He died quickly, 
but the fire, after having burned the legs of Ridley, 
sunk. There he lingered chained to the iron post, 
and crying, “0! I cannot burn! O! For Christ sake 
let the fire come unto me!” And still when his 
brother-in-law had heaped on more wood, he was 
heard through the blinding smoke, still dismally 
crying: “O! I cannot bum, I cannot bum!” At 
last, the gunpowder caught fire, and ended his 
miseries. 

Five days after this fearful scene, Gardiner went 
to his tremendous account before God, for the cruel- 
ties he had so much assisted in committing* 

Cranmer remained still alive and in prison.

Gardiner’s work, even in his life-time, when Oar- 
diner was tired of it. Cranmer was now degraded 
as a priest, and left for death; but, if the Queen 
hated any one on earth, she hated him, and it was 
resolved that he should be ruined and disgraced to 
the utmost. There is no doubt that the Queen and 
her husband personally urged on these deeds, be- 
cause they wrote to the Council, urging them to be 
active in the kindling of the fearful fires. As Cran- 
mer was known not to be a firm man , a plan was 
had for surrounding him with artful people, and 
inducing him to recant to the unreformed religion. 
Deans and friars visited him, played at bowls with 
him, showed him various attentions, talked per- 
suasively with him, gave him money for his prison 
comforts, and induced him to sign, I fear, as many 
as six recantations. But when, after aU, he was 
taken out to be burnt, he was nobly true to his 
better self, and made a glorious end. 

After prayers and a sermon, Dr. Cole, the 
preacher of the day (who had been one of the art- 
fol priests about Cranmer in prison) required him 
to make a public confession of his faith before the 
people. This Cole did, expecting that he would 
declare himself a Roman Catholic. “I will make 
a profession of my faith,” said Cranmer, “and with 
a good will too.” 

Then, he arose before them all, and took from 
the sleeve of his robe a written prayer and read it 
aloud. That done, he kneeled and said the Lord’s 
Prayer , all the people joining; and then he arose 
again and told them that he believed in the Bible,

and that in what he had lately written, he had 
written what was not the truth, and because his 
hand had signed those papers, he would bum his 
right hand first when he came to the fire. As to 
the Pope he did refuse him and denounce him as 
the enemy of Heaven. Hereupon the pious Dr. 
Cole cried out to the guards to stop that heretic’s 
mouth and take him away. 

So, they took him away, and chained him to the 
stake, where he hastily took off his own clothes to 
make ready for the flames, and stood before them 
with a bald head and a white and flowing heard 
He was so firm now, when the worst was come, that 
he again declared against his recantation, and was 
eo impressive and so undismayed, that a certain 
lord, who was one of the directors of the execution, 
called out to the men to make haste i When the 
fire was lighted, Cranmer, true to his latest words, 
stretched out his right hand, and crying out ^This 
hand hath offended!” held it out among the flames, 
until it blazed and burned away. His heart was 
found entire among bis ashes , and he left at last 
a memorable name in English history. Cardinal 
Pole celebrated the day by saying his first mass, 
and next day be was made Archbishop of Canter- 
bury in Cranmer’s place. 

The Queen’s husband, who was now mostly 
abroad in Ms own dominions, and generally made 
a coarse jest of her to his more familiar couxtieis, 
was at war with France, and came over to seek the 
assistance of England. England was very unwiltog

detestation in Great Britain. Her memory has been 
held in such abhorrence that some writers hare 
arisen in later years to take her part, and to show 
that she was, upon the whole, quite an amiable 
and cheerful sovereign! u By their fruits ye shall

CHAPTER XXXI. 

ENGLAND UNDER QUEEN ELIZABETH. 

There was great rejoicing all over the land 
when the Lords of the Council went down to Hat- 
field, to hail the Princess Elizabeth as the new 
Queen of England. Weary of the barbarities of 
Mary’s reign, the people looked with hope and 
gladness to the new Sovereign. The nation seemed 
to wake from a horrible dream; and Heaven, so 
long hidden by the smoke of the fires that roasted 
men and women to death, appeared to brighten 
once more. 

Queen Elizabeth was five -and -twenty years of 
age when she rode through the streets of London, 
from the Tower to Westminster Abbey, to be crowned. 
Her countenance was strongly marked, but on the 
whole, commanding and dignified; her hair was red, 
and her nose something too long and sharp for a 
woman’s. She was not the beautiful creature her 
courtiers made out; but she was well enough, and

Ho doubt looked all the better for coining after the 
dark and gloomy Mary. She was well educated, 
but a roundabout writer, and rather a hard swearer 
and coarse talker. She was clever, but cunning 
and deceitful, and inherited much of her father’s 
violent temper. I mention this now, because she 
has been so overpraised by one party, and so over- 
abused by another, that it is hardly possible to 
understand the greater part of her reign without first 
understanding what kind of woman she really was. 

She began her reign with the great advantage 
of having a very wise and careful Minister. Sir 
William Cecil, whom she afterwards made Lord 
Burleigh. Altogether, the people had greater rea- 
son for rejoicing than they usually had, when there 
were processions in the streets; and they were happy 
with some reason. AH kinds of shows and images 
were set up; Goa and Magog were hoisted to the 
top of Temple Bar; and (which was more to the 
purpose) the Corporation dutifully presented the 
young Queen with the sum of a thousand marks 
in gold — so heavy a present, that she was obliged 
to take it into her carriage with both hands. The 
coronation was a great success; and on the next 
day, one of the courtiers presented a petition to 
the new Queen, praying that as it was the custom 
to release some prisoners on such occasions, she 
would have the goodness to release the four Evan- 
gelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and also 
the Apostle Saint Paid, who had been for some 
time shut up in a strange language so that the 
people could not get at them.

152 a child's history or England. 

To this, the Queen replied that it would be 
better first to inquire of themselves whether they 
desired to be released or not; and, as a means of 
finding out, a great public discussion — a sort of 
religious tournament — was appointed to take place 
between certain champions of the two religions, in 
Westminster Abbey. You may suppose that it 
soon made pretty clear to common sense, that ftf 
people to benefit by what they repeat or read, it 
is rather necessary that they should understand 
something about it. Accordingly, a Church Service 
in plain English was settled, and other laws sad 
regulations were made, completely establishing the 
great work of the Reformation. The Romish bi- 
shops and champions were not harshly dealt with, 
all things considered; and the Queen's Ministers 
were both prudent and merciful. 

The one great trouble, of this reign, and the 
unfortunate cause of the greater part of such 
turmoil and bloodshed as occurred in it, was Mae? 
Stuart, Queen of Scots. We will try to under- 
stand, in as few words as possible, who Mary was, 
what she was, and how she came to be a thorn in 
the royal pillow of Elizabeth. 

She was the daughter of the Queen Regent of 
Scotland, Mary of Guise. She had been married, 
when a mere child, to the Danphin, the son and 
heir of the King of France. The Pope, who p** . 
tended that no one could rightfully wear the crown 
of England without his gracious permission, was 
strongly opposed to Elizabeth, who had not asked 
for it And as Mary Queen of Scots would have

inherited the English crown in right of her birth, 
supposing the English Parliament not to have 
altered the succession, the Pope himself, and most 
of the discontented who were followers of his, main- 
tained that Mary was 'the rightful Queen of Eng- 
land, and Elizabeth the wrongful Queen. Mary 
being so closely connected with France, and France 
being jealous of England, there was far greater 
danger in this than there would have been if she 
had had no alliance with that great power. And 
when her young husband, on the death of his father, 
became Fbancis the Second, King of France, the 
matter grew very serious. . For the young couple 
styled themselves Bang and Queen of England; and 
the Pope was disposed to help them by doing all 
the mischief he could. 

Now, the reformed religion, under the guidance 
of a stern and powerful preacher, named John 
Knox, and other .such men, had been making fierce 
progress in Scotland. It was still a half savage 
country, where there was a great deal of murdering 
and rioting continually going on; and the Reformers, 
instead of reforming those evils as they should have 
done, went to work in the ferocious old Scottish 
spirit: laying churches and chapels waste, pulling 
down pictures and altars, and knocking about the 
Grey Friars, and the Black Friars , and the White 
Friars, and the friars of all sorts of colours, in all 
directions. This obdurate and barsh spirit of the 
Scottish Reformers (the Scotch have always been 
rather a sullen and frowning people in religious 
matters) put up the blood of the Romish French

court, and caused France to send troops over to 
Scotland, with the hope of setting the Mars of $SL 
sorts of colours on their legs again; of conquering 
that country first, and England afterwards; and so 
crushing the Reformation all to pieces. The Soot* 
tish Reformers, who had formed a great league 
which they called The Congregation of the LoaA 
secretly represented to Elizabeth that, if the reformed 
religion got the worst of it with them, it would be 
likely to get the worst of it in England too; and 
thus, Elizabeth, although she had a high notion of 
the rights of Kings and Queens to do anything 
they liked, sent an army to Scotland to support 
the Reformers who were in arms against their 
sovereign. All these proceedings led to a treaty of 
peace at Edinburgh, under which the French con- 
sented to depart from the kingdom. By a separate 
treaty, Mary and her young husband engaged to 
renounce their assumed title of King and Queen of 
England. But this treaty they never fulfilled. 

It happened, soon after matters had got to this 
state, that the young French King died, leaving 
Mary a young widow. She was then invited by 
her Scottish subjects to return home and reign over 
them; and as she was not now happy where she 
was, she, after a little time, complied. 

Elizabeth had been Queen three years, when 
Mary Queen of Scots embarked at Calais for her 
own rough, quarrelling country. As she came out 
of the harbour, a vessel was lost before her eyes, 
and she said, u O! good God! what an omen this 
is for such a voyage!” She was very fond of France,

and sat on the deck, looking back at it and weeping, 
until it was quite dark. When she went to bed, she 
directed to be called at day -break, if the French 
coast were still visible, that she might behold it 
for the last time. As it proved to be a dear morn- 
ing, this was done, and she again wept for the 
country she was leaving, and said many times, 
“Farewell, France! Farewell, France! I shall never 
see thee again!” All this was long remembered after- 
wards, as sorrowful and interesting in a fair young 
princess of nineteen; and I am afraid it gradually 
came, together with her other distresses, to sur- 
round her with greater sympathy than she deserved. 

When she came to Scotland, and took up her 
abode at the palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh, she 
found herself among uncouth strangers, and wild 
uncomfortable customs, very different from her ex- 
periences in the court of France. The very people 
who were disposed to love her, made her head ache 
when she was tired out by her voyage, with a sere-, 
nade of discordant music — a fearful concert of 
bagpipes , I suppose — and brought her and her 
train home to her palace on miserable little Scotch 
horses that appeared to be half- starved. Among 
the people who were not disposed to love her, she 
found the powerful leaders of the Reformed Church, 
who were bitter upon her amusements, however in- 
nocent, and denounced music and dancing as workB 
of the devil. John Knox himself often lectured her, 
violently and angrily, and did much to make her 
life unhappy. All these reasons confirmed her old 
attachment to the Romish religion, and caused her t

there is no doubt, most imprudently and dangerously, 
both for herself and for England too, to give a so- 
lemn pledge to the heads of the Romish Church that 
if she ever succeeded to the English crown, she 
would set up that religion again. In reading her 
unhappy history, you must always remember this, 
and also that during her whole life she was con- 
stantly put forward against the Queen, in some form 
or other, by the Romish party. 

That Elizabeth, on the other hand, was not in- 
clined to like her, is pretty certain. Elizabeth was 
very vain and jealous, and had an extraordinary 
dislike to people being married. She treated Lady 
Catherine Grey, sister of the beheaded Lady Jane, 
with such shameful* severity for no other reason 
than her being secretly married, that she died and 
her husband was ruined; so when a second marriage 
for Mary began to be talked about, probably Eli- 
zabeth disliked her more. Not that Elizabeth wanted 
suitors of her Own, for they started up from all sorts 
of places: Spain, Austria, Sweden and England. 
Her English lover at this time, and one whom she 
much favoured too, was Lord Robert Dudley, 
Earl of Leicester — himself secretly married to 
Amy Robsart, the daughter of an English gen- 
tleman, whom he was strongly suspected of causing 
to be murdered, down at his country seat, Cumnor 
Hall in Berkshire, that he might he free to marry 
the Queen. Upon this story, the great writer, Sm 
Walter Scott, has founded one of his best ro- 
mances. But if Elizabeth knew how to lead her 
handsome favorite on for her own vanity and plo*-

sure, she knew how to stop him for her own pride; 
and his lore and all the other proposals came to 
nothing. The Queen always declared in good set 
speeches, that she would never be married at all, 
hat would live and die a Maiden Queen. It was 
% very pleasant and meritorious declaration I sup- 
pose; but it has been puffed and trumpeted so much, 
that I am rather tired of it myself. 

Divers princes proposed to marry Mary, but the 
English court had reasons for being jealous of them 
aU, and even proposed, as a matter of policy, that 
she should marry that very Earl of Leicester, who 
had aspired to be the husband of Elizabeth. At 
last, Lord Darnley, son of the Earl of Lennox, 
and himself descended from the Royal Family of 
Scotland, went over with Elizabeth’s consent to try 
Us fortune at Holyrood. He was a tall simpleton, 
and could dance and play the guitar, but I know 
of nothing else he could do, unless it were to get 
vwy drunk, and eat gluttonously, and make a con- 
temptible spectacle of himself in many mean and 
vain ways. However, he gained Mary’s heart, not 
&daixirag in the pursuit of his object to ally him- 
self with one of her secretaries, David Rizzio, who 
had great influence with her. He soon married the 
queen. This marriage does not say much for her, 
hut what followed it will presently say less. 

Mary’s brother, the Earl op Murray, and head 
of the Protestant party in Scotland, had opposed 
marriage, partly on religious grounds, and 
partly, perhaps, from personal dislike of the very 
cuatemptible bridegroom. When it had taken place,

through Mary’s gaining over to it the more power- 
ful of the lords about her, she banished Murray 
for his pains; and when he and some other nobles 
rose in arms to support the Beformed religion, she 
herself, within a month of her wedding day, rode 
against them in armour, with loaded pistols at her 
saddle. Driven out of Scotland, they presented 
themselves before Elizabeth — who called them 
traitors in public, and assisted them in private, ac- 
cording to her crafty nature. 

Mary had been married but a little while, when 
she began to hate her husband, who, in his turn, 
began to hate that David Bizzio, with whom he had 
leagued to gain her favor, and whom he now be- 
lieved to be her lover. He hated Bizzio to that 
extent, that he made a compact with Lobd Buthven 
and three other lords to get rid of him by murder. 
This wicked agreement they made in solemn se- 
eresy upon the first of March, fifteen hundred and 
sixty-six, and on the night of Saturday the ninth, 
the conspirators were brought by Damley up, a 
private staircase, dark and steep, into a range of 
rooms where they knew that Mary was sitting at 
supper with her sister, Lady Argyle, and this 
doomed man. When they went into the room, and 
Damley took the Queen round the waist, and Lord 
Buthven, who had risen from a bed of sickness to 
do this murder, came in, gaunt and ghastly, lean- 
ing on two men, Bizzio ran behind the Queen for 
shelter and protection. “Let him come out of the 
room,” said Buthven. “He shall not leave the 
room,” replied the Queen. “I read his danger **

your face, and it is my will that he remain here.” 
They then set upon him, struggled with him, over- 
turned the table, dragged him out, and killed him 
with fifty-six stabs. When the Queen heard that 
he was dead, she said, “No more tears. I will 
think now of revenge!” 

Within a day or two, she gained her husband 
over, and prevailed on the long idiot to abandon 
the conspirators and fly with her to Dunbar. There 
he issued a proclamation, audaciously and falsely 
denying that he had had any knowledge of the 
late bloody business, and there they were joined 
by the Earl Bothwell and some other nobles. 
With their help, they raised eight thousand men, 
^turned to Edinburgh and drove the assassins into 
England. Mary soon afterwards gave birth to a 
son * — still thinking of revenge. 

That she should have had a greater scorn for 
her husband after this late cowardice and treachery 
than she had had before, was natural enough. 
There is very little doubt that she now began to 
love Bothwell instead, and to plan with him means 
of getting rid of Damley. Bothwell had such power 
over her that he induced her even to pardon the 
assassins of Bizzio. The arrangements for the 
christening of the young Prince were intrusted to 
him, and he was one of the most important people 
at the ceremony, where the child was named James: 
Elizabeth being his godmother, though not present 
on the occasion. A week afterwards Darnley, who 
had left Mary and gone to his father’s house at 
Glasgow, being taken ill with the small-pox, she

sent her own physician to attend him. But there 
is great reason to apprehend that this was merely 
a show and a pretence, and that she knew what 
was doing, when BothweU, within another month, 
proposed to one of the late conspirators against 
Bizzio, to murder Damley, “for that it was the 
Queen’s mind that he should be taken away.” It is 
certain that on that very day she wrote to her am- 
bassador in France, complaining of him, and yet 
went immediately to Glasgow, feigning to he very * 
anxious about him, and to love him very much. If 
she wanted to get him within her power, she suc- 
ceeded to her heart’s content; for she induced him 
to go back with her to Edinburgh, and to occupy, 
instead of the palace, a lone house outside the chy 
called the Kirk of Field. _ Here , he lived about a 
week. One Sunday night, she remained with ban 
until ten o’clock, and then left him, to go to Holy- 
rood to be present at an entertainment given in j 
celebration of the marriage of one of her favorite 
servants. At two o’clock in the morning the city 
was shaken by a great explosion, and the Kirk of 
Field was blown to atoms. 

Damley’s body was found next day lying under 
a tree at some distance. How it came there, un- 
disfigured and nnscorched by gunpowder, and how 
this crime came to be so clumsily and strangely 
committed, it is impossible to discover. The deceit- 
ful character of Mary, and the deceitful character 
of Elizabeth , have rendered almost every part 
their joint history uncertain and obscure. But, I 
fear that Mary was unquestionably a party to her

husband’s murder, and that this was the revenge 
she bad threatened. The Scotch people universally 
believed it. Voices cried out in the streets of 
Edinburgh in the dead of the night, for justice on 
the murderess. Placards were posted by unknown 
hands in the public places , denouncing Bothwell as 
the murderer, and the Queen as his accomplice; 
and when he afterwards married her (though him- 
self already married) , previously making a show of 
taking her prisoner by force, the indignation of the 
people knew no bounds. The women particularly 
are described as having been quite frantic with 
their guilty Queen, and to have hooted and cried 
after her in the streets with terrific vehemence. 

Such guilty unions seldom prosper. This hus- 
band and wife had lived together but a month, 
when they were separated for ever by the suc- 
cesses of a band of Scotch nobles who associated 
against them for the protection of the young Prince: 
whom Bothwell had vainly endeavoured to lay 
bold of, and whom he would certainly have mur- 
dered, if the Earl op Mar, in whose hands the 
boy was, had not been firmly and honorably faith- 
ful to his trust. Before this angry power, Both- 
well fled abroad, where he died, a prisoner and 
mad, nine miserable years afterwards. Mary being 
found by the associated lords to deceive them at 
every turn, was sent a prisoner to Lochleven 
Castle, which, as it stood in the midst of a lake, 
could only be approached by boat. Here, one 
Lord Lindsay, who was so much of a brute that 
foe nobles would have done better if they had

chosen a mere gentleman for their messenger, made 
her sign her abdication, and appoint Murray, Re- 
gent of Scotland. Here, too, Murray saw her in 
a sorrowing and humbled state. 

She had better have remained in the castle of 
Lochleven, dull prison as it was , with the rippling 
of the lake against it, and the moving shadows of 
the water on the room -walls; but she could not 
rest there, and more than once tried to escape. 
The first time she had nearly succeeded, dressed 
in the clothes of her own washerwoman: when, 
putting up her hand to prevent one of the boatmen 
from lifting her veil, the men suspected her, seeing 
how white it was, and rowed her back again. A 
short time afterwards , her fascinating manners en- 
listed in her cause a boy in the Castle, called the 
little Douglas, who, while the family were at 
supper, stole the keys of the great gate, went 
softly out with the Queen, locked the gate on the 
outside, and rowed her away across the lake, sink* 
ing the keys as they went along. On the opposite 
shore she was met by another Douglas, and some 
few lords, and so accompanied rode away on horse- 
back to Hamilton, where they raised three thousand 
men. Here, she issued a proclamation, declaring 
that the abdication she had signed in her prison 
was illegal, and requiring the Regent to yield to 
his lawful Queen. Being a steady soldier, and in 
no way discomposed although he was without an 
army, Murray pretended to treat with her, until 
he had collected a force about half equal to her 
own, and then he gave her battle. In one quarter*

of-an-hour he cut down all her hopes. She had 
another weary ride on horseback of sixty long 
Seotch miles, and took shelter at Dundrennau 
Abbey, whence she fled for safety to Elizabeth’s 
dominions. 

Mary Queen of Scots came to England — to 
her own ruin, the trouble of the kingdom, and the 
misery and death of ipany — in the year one thou- 
sand five hundred and sixty-eight. How she left 
it and the world, nineteen years afterwards, we 
have now to see. 


CHAPTER XXXII. 

ENGLAND UNDER QUEEN ELIZABETH. 

When Mary Queen of Scots arrived in Eng- 
land, without money and even without any other 
clothes than those she wore, she wrote to Elizabeth, 
representing herself as an innocent and injured 
piece of Royalty, and entreating her assistance to 
oblige her Scottish subjects to take her back again 
and obey her. But, as her character was already 
known in England to be a very different one from 
what she made it out to be, she was told in answer 
that she must first clear herself. Made uneasy by 
this condition, Mary, rather than stay in England, 
would have gone to Spain, or to France, or would 
even have gone back to Scotland. But, as her doing 
either would have been likely to trouble England 
afresh, it was decided that she should be detained

here. She first came to Carlisle, and, after that, 
was moved about from castle to castle, as was con- 
sidered necessary; but England she never left 
again. 

After trying very hard to get rid of the neces- 
sity of clearing herself, Mary, advised by Lobd 
Heebies, her best friend in England, agreed to 
answer the charges against her, if the Scottish 
noblemen who made them would attend to maintain 
them, before such English noblemen as Elizabeth 
might appoint for that purpose. Accordingly, such 
an assembly, under the name of a Conference, met, 
first at York, and afterwards at Hampton Court 
In its presence Lord Lennox, Darnley’s father, 
openly charged Mary with the murder of his son; 
and whatever Mary’s friends may now say or write 
in her behalf, there is no doubt that when her bro- 
ther Murray produced against her a casket contain- 
ing certain guilty letters and verses , which he 
stated to have passed between her and Bothwell, 
she withdrew from the inquiry. Consequently, it 
is to be supposed that she was then considered 
guilty by those who had the best opportunities of 
judging of the truth, and that the feeling which 
afterwards arose in her behalf was a very generous 
but not a very reasonable one. 

However, the Duke of Norfolk, an honorable 
bnt rather weak nobleman, partly because Mary 
was captivating, partly because he was ambitious, 
and partly because he was over persuaded by a**" 
ful plotters against Elizabeth, conceived a strong , 
idea that he would like to marry the Queen of

Seats — though he was a little frightened, too, by 
the letters in the casket This idea being secretly 
encouraged by some of Elizabeth's court, and even 
by the favorite Earl of Leicester (because it was 
objected to by other favorites who were his rivals), 
Mary expressed her approval of it , and the King 
of France and the King of Spain are supposed to 
We done the same. It was not so quietly planned, 
though, but that it came to Elizabeth's ears, who 
warned the Duke u to be careful what sort of pillow 
be was going to lay his head upon.” He made a 
humble reply at the time, but turned sulky soon 
afterwards, and, being considered dangerous, was 
sent to the Tower. 

Thus, from the moment of Mary’s coming to 
England she began to be the centre of plots and 
miseries. 

A rise of the Catholics in the north was the 
next of these, and it was only checked by many exe- 
cutions and much bloodshed. It was followed by 
a great conspiracy among the Pope and some of 
the Catholic sovereigns of Europe to depose Eliza- 
beth, place Mary on the throne, and restore the 
tmreformed religion. It is almost impossible to 
doubt that Mary knew and approved of it; and the 
Pope himself was so hot in the matter that he 
maned a bull, in which he openly called Elizabeth 
the “pretended Queen” of England, excommuni- 
cated her, and excommunicated all her subjects who 
Bhould continue to obey her. A copy of this miser- 
able paper got into London, and was found one 
morning publicly posted on Ihe Bishop of London's

gate. A great hue and cry being raised, another 
copy was found in the chamber of a student of 
Lincoln’s Inn, who confessed, being put upon the 
rack, that he had received it from one John Pel- 
ton, a rich gentleman who lived across the Thames, 
near Southwark. This John Felton, feeing put upon 
the rack too, confessed that he had posted the pla- 
card on the Bishop’s gate. For this offence he was, 
within four days, taken to St. Paul’s Churchyard* 
and there hanged and quartered. As to the Pope’s 
bull, the people by the Reformation having thrown 
off the Pope, did not care much, you may suppose, 
for the Pope’s throwing off them. It was a mere 
dirty piece of paper, and not half so powerful as 
a street ballad. 

On the very day when Felton was brought to 
his trial, the poor Duke of Norfolk was released. 
It would have been well for him if he had kept 
away from the Tower evermore, and from the snares 
that had taken him there. But, even while he was 
in that dismal place he corresponded with Mary, 
and as soon as he was out of it he began to plot 
again. Being discovered in correspondence with 
the Pope, with a view to a rising in England which 
should force Elizabeth to consent to his marriage 
with Mary, and to repeal the laws against the Ca- 
tholics , he was recommitted to the Tower and 
brought to trial. He was found guilty by the unan- 
imous verdict of the Lords who tried him, and 
was sentenced to the block. 

It is very difficult to make out, at this distance 
of time, and between opposite accounts, whether

Elizabeth really was a humane woman, or desired 
to appear so, or was fearful of shedding the blood 
of people of great name who were popular in the 
country. Twice she commanded and countermanded 
the execution of this Duke, and it did not take 
place, at last, until five months after his trial. The 
scaffold was erected on Tower Hill, and there he 
died like a brave man. He refused to have his 
eyes bandaged, saying that he was not all afraid 
of death; and he admitted the justice of his sentence, 
and was much regretted by the people. 

Although Mary had shrunk at the most impor 
tant time from disproving her guilt, she was very 
careful never to do anything that would admit it. 
All such proposals as were made to her by Eliza- 
beth for her release, required that admission in 
some form or other, and therefore came to nothing. 
Moreover, both women being artful and treacherous, 
and neither ever trusting the other, it was not likely 
that they could ever make an agreement So, the 
Parliament, aggravated by what the Pope had done, 
made new and strong laws against the spreading 
of the Catholic religion in England, and declared 
it treason in any one to say that the Queen and 
her successors were not the lawful sovereigns of 
England. It would have done more than this, but 
for Elizabeth’s moderation. 

Since the Beformation, there had come to be 
three great sects of religious people — or people 
who Called themselves so — in England; that is 
to say, those who belonged to the Beformed Church, 
those who belonged to the unreformed Church, and

those who were called the Puritans, because they 
said that they wanted to have everything very pure 
and plain in all Church service. These* last were 
for the most part an uncomfortable people, who 
thought it highly meritorious to dress in a hideous 
manner, talk through their noses, and oppose all 
harmless enjoyments. But they were powerful too, 
and very much in earnest; and they were, one and 
all, the determined enemies of the Queen of Scots. 
The Protestant feeling in England was further 
strengthened by the tremendous cruelties to which 
Protestants were exposed in France and in the 
Netherlands. Scores of thousands of them were 
put to death in those countries with every cruelty 
that can be imagined, and at last, in the autumn 
of the year one thousand five hundred and seven* 
ty-two, one of the greatest barbarities ever commit- 
ted in the world took place at Paris. 

It is called in history, The Massacre of Saint 
Bartholomew, because it took place on Saint 
Bartholomew’s Eve. It fell on Saturday the twenty- 
third of August On that day all the great leaders 
of the Protestants (who were there called Hugue- 
nots) were assembled together, for the purpose, as 
was represented to them, of doing honor to the 
marriage of their chief, the young King of Navarre, 
with the sister of Charles the Ninth: a miserable 
young king who then occupied the French throne. 
This dull creature was made to believe by his mo- 
ther and other fierce Catholics about him that the 
Huguenots meant to take his life; and he was per- 
suaded to give secret orders that, on the tolling of

a great bell, they should be fallen upon by an 
overpowering force of armed men, and slaughtered 
wherever they could be found. When the appointed 
hour was close at hand, the stupid wretch, trembling 
from head to foot, was taken into a balcony by his 
mother to see the atrocious work begun. The mo- 
ment the bell tolled, the murderers broke forth/ 
During all that night and the two next days, they 
broke into the houses, fired the houses, shot and 
stabbed the Protestants, men, women and children, 
and flung their bodies into the streets. They were 
shot at in the streets as they passed along; and 
their blood ran down the gutters. Upwards of ten 
thousand Protestants were killed in Paris alone} 
and in all France four or five times that number. 
To return thanks to Heaven for these diabolical 
murders, the Pope and his train actually went in 
public procession at Rome; and as if this were not 
shame enough for them, they had a medal struck 
to commemorate the event. But, however comfor- 
table the wholesale murders were to those high 
authorities, they had not that soothing effect upon 
the doll -King. I am happy to state that he never 
knew a moment's peace afterwards; that he was 
continually crying out that he saw the Huguenots 
covered with blood and wounds falling dead before 
him; and that he died within a year, shrieking and 
yelling and raving to that degree that if all the 
Popes who had ever lived had been rolled into one, 
they would not have afforded His guilty Majesty 
the slightest consolation.

170 A child’s HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 

When the terrible news of the massacre arrived 
in England, it made a powerful impression indeed 
upon the people. If they began to run a little wild 
against the Catholics at about this time, this fear- 
ful reason for it, coming so soon after the days of 
.Bloody Queen Mary, must be remembered in their 
excuse. The Court was not quite so honest as the 
people — but perhaps it sometimes is not. It re- 
ceived the French ambassador, with all the lords 
and ladies dressed in deep mourning and keeping 
a profound silence. Nevertheless, a proposal of 
marriage which he had made to Elizabeth only two 
days before the eve of Saint Bartholomew, on be- 
half of the Duke of Alenin, the French King’s 
brother, a boy of seventeen, still went on; while on 
the other hand, in her usual crafty way, the Queen 
secretly supplied the Huguenots with money and 
weapons. 

I must say that for a Queen who made all those 
fine speeches , of which I have confessed myself to 
be rather tired, about living and dying a Maiden 
Queen, Elizabeth was “going” to be married pretty 
often. Besides always having some English fa- 
vorite or other, whom she by turns encouraged, 
and swore at, and knocked about — for the maiden 
Queen was very free with her fists — she held this 
French Duke off and on through several years. 
When he at last came over to England, the mar- 
riage articles were actually drawn up, and it was 
settled that the wedding should take place in six 
weeks. The Queen was then so bent upon it, that 
she prosecuted a poor Puritan named Stubbs, and

a poor bookseller named Page, for writing and 
publishing a pamphlet against it. Their right hands 
were chopped off for this crime; and poor Stubbs 
— more loyal than I should have been myself 
under the circumstances — immediately pulled off 
bis hat with his left hand and cried, “God save the 
Queen!” Stubbs was cruelly treated, for the mar- 
riage never took place after all, though the Queen 
pledged herself to the Duke with a ring from her 
own finger, fie went away, no better than he came, 
when the courtship had lasted some ten years altoge- 
ther; and he died a couple of years afterwards, 
mourned by Elizabeth, who appears to have been 
really fond of him. It is not much to her credit, 
for he was a bad enough member of a bad family. 

To return to the Catholics. There arose two 
orders of priests, who were very busy in England, 
and who were much dreaded. These were the Je- 
suits (who were everywhere, in all sorts of disgui- 
ses), and the Seminary Priests. The people had 
a great horror of the first, because they were known 
to have taught that murder was lawful if it were 
done with an object of which they approved; and 
they had a horror of the second because they came 
to teach the old religion, and to be the successors 
of “Queen Mary’s priests,” as those yet lingering 
in England were called, when they should die out 
The severest laws were made against them, and 
were most unmercifully executed. Those who shel- 
tered them in their houses often suffered heavily 
for what was an act of humanity; and the rack, 
that cruel torture which tore men’s limbs asunder,

was constantly kept going. What these unhappy 
men confessed, or what was ever confessed by any 
one under that agony, must always he received 
with great doubt, as it is certain that people have 
frequently owned to the most absurd and impos- 
sible crimes, only to escape such dreadful suffering. 
But I cannot doubt it to have been proved by pa- 
pers , that there were many plots , both among the 
Jesuits, and with France, and with Scotland, and 
with Spain, for the destruction of Queen Elizabeth, 
for the placing of Mary on the throne, and for the 
revival of the old religion. 

If the English people were too ready to believe 
in plots, there were, as I have said, good reasons 
for it. When the massacre of Saint Bartholomew 
was yet fresh in their recollection, a great Pro- 
testant Dutch hero, the Prince op Orange, was 
shot by an assassin, who confessed that he had 
/ been kept and trained for the purpose in a college 
of J esuits. The Dutch, in this surprise and distress, 
offered to make Elizabeth their sovereign, but she 
declined the honor, and sent them a small army 
instead, under the command of the Earl of Lei- 
cester, who, although a capital Court favorite, was 
not much of a general. He did so little in Holland, 
that his campaign there would probably have been 
forgotten, but for its occasioning the death of one 
of the best writers, the best knights, and the best 
gentlemen, of that or any age. This was Sir P®' 
lip Sidney, who was wounded by a musket bah 
in the thigh as he mounted a fresh horse, after ha- 
ving had his own kille d under him .- He bad to I

ride beck, wounded, a long distance, and was very 
faint with fatigue and loss of blood, when some 
water, for which he had eagerly asked, was handed 
to him. But be was so good and gentle even then, 
that seeing a poor badly wounded common soldier 
lying on the ground, looking at the water with 
longing eyes, he said, “Thy necessity is greater 
than mine,” and gave it up to him. This touching 
action of a noble heart is perhaps as well known 
as any incident in history — is as famous far and 
*ide as the blood-stained Tower of London, with 
its axe, and block, and murders out of number. So 
delightful is an act of true humanity, and so glad 
am mankind to remember it. 

At home, intelligence of plots began to thicken 
every day. I suppose the people never did live 
wider such continual terrors as those by which they 
were possessed now, of Catholic risings, and burn- 
ings, and poisonings, and I don’t know what. Still, 
we must always remember that they lived near and 
close to awful realities of that kind , and that with 
their experience it was not so difficult to believe in 
any enormity. The government had the same fear, 
and did not take the best means of discovering the 
truth; for besides torturing the suspected, it em- 
ployed paid spies, who will always lie for their 
own profit; and it even made some of the conspira- 
cies it brought to light, by sending false letters to 
disaffected people, inviting them to join in pretended 
plots, which they too readily did. 

But, one great real plot was at length disco- 
vered, and it ended the career of Mary, Queen o£

Scots. A seminary priest named Ballard, and a 
Spanish soldier named Savage, set on and encou- 
raged by certain French priests, imparted a design 
to one Antony Babington — a gentleman of for- 
tune in Derbyshire, who had been for some time a 
secret agent of Mary’s — for murdering the Queen. 
Babington then confided the scheme to some other 
Catholic gentlemen who were his friends, and they 
joined in it heartily. They were vain weak-headed 
young men, ridiculously confident, and preposterously 
proud of their plan; for they got a gimcrack paint- 
ing made, of the six choice spirits who were to 
murder Elizabeth, with Babington in an attitude for 
the centre figure. Two of their body, however, one 
of whom was a priest, kept Elizabeth’s wisest mi- 
nister, Sir Francis Walsingham, acquainted with 
the whole project from the first. The conspirators 
were completely deceived to the final point, when 
Babington gave Savage, because he was shabby, a 
ring from his finger, and some money from his 
purse, wherewith to buy himself new clothes in 
which to kill the Queen. Walsingham, having then 
full evidence against the whole band, and two let- 
ters of Mary’s besides, resolved to seize them. 
Suspecting something wrong, they stole out of the 
city, one by one, and hid themselves in St. John’s 
Wood, and other places which really were hiding 
places then; but they were all taken, and all exe- 
cuted. When they were seized, a gentleman was 
sent from Court to inform Mary of the fact, and of 
her being involved in the discovery. Her friends 
have complained that she was kept in very hard

and severe custody. It does not appear very likely, 
for she was going out a hunting that very morning* 
Queen Elizabeth had been warned long a go, by 
one in Prance who had good information of what 
was secretly doing, that in holding Mary alive, she 
held “the wolf who would devour her.” The Bi- 
shop of London had, more lately, given the Queen’s 
favorite minister the advice, in writing, “forthwith 
j to cut off the Scottish Queen’s head.” The question 
| now was, what to do with her. The Earl of Lei- 
| cester wrote a little note home from Holland, re- 
| commending that she should be quietly poisoned; 
j that noble favorite having accustomed his mind, it 
j is possible, to remedies of that nature. His black 
advice, however, was disregarded, and she was 
brought to trial- at Fotheringay Castle in Northamp- 
tonshire, before a tribunal of forty, composed of 
both religions. There, and in the Star Chamber at 
Westminster, the trial lasted a fortnight. She de- 
fended herself with great ability, but could only 
deny the confessions that had been made by Ba- 
j bington and others; could only call her own letters, 

' produced against her by her own secretaries, forge- 
ries; and, in short, could only deny everything* 
She was found guilty, and declared to have incur-

proved the sentence, and prayed the Queen to have 
it executed. The Queen replied that she requested 
them to consider whether no means could be found 
of saving Mary’s life without endangering her own. 
The Parliament rejoined, No, and the citizens illu- 
minated their houses and lighted bonfires, in token

of their joy that all these plots and troubles were 
to he ended by the death of the Queen of Scots. 

She, feeling sure that her time was now come, 
wrote a letter to the Queen of England, making 
three entreaties; first, that she might be buried in 
France; secondly, that she might not be executed 
in secret, but before her servants and some others; 
thirdly, that after her death, her servants should 
not be molested, but should be suffered to go home 
with the legacies she left them. It was an affecting 
letter, and Elizabeth shed tears over it, but sent no 
answer. Then came a special ambassador from 
France, and another from Scotland, to intercede 
for Mary’s life; and then the nation began to cla- 
mour, more and more, for her death. 

What the real feelings or intentions -of Elisa- 
beth were, can never be known now; but I strongly 
suspect her of only wishing one thing more than 
Mary’s death, and that was to keep free of the 
blame of it On the first of February, one thou- 
sand five hundred and eighty-seven, Lord Burleigh 
having drawn out the warrant for the execution, 
the Queen sent to the secretary Davison to bring 
it to her, that she might sign it: which she did. 
Next day, when Davison told her it was sealed, 
she angtily asked him why such haste was neces- 
sary? Next day but one she joked about it, and 
swore a little. Again, next day but one, she Beam- 
ed to complain that it was not yet done, but still 
she would not be plain with those about her. So, 
on the seventh, the Earl of Kent and Shrewsbury, 
with the Sheriff of Northamptonshire, came with

the warrant to Fotheringay , to tell the Queen of 
Scots to prepare for death. 

When those messengers of ill omen were gone, 
Mary made a frugal supper, drank to her servants, 
read over her will, went to bed, slept for some 
hours, and then arose and passed the remainder 
of the night saying prayers. In the morning she 
dressed herself in her best clothes, and at eight 
o^clock When the sheriff came for her to her chapel, 
took leave of her servants who were there assembled 
laying with her, and went down stairs, carrying 
a Bible in one hand and a crucifix in the other. 
Two of her women and four of her men were 
allowed to be present. in the hall, where a low 
scaffold, only two feet from the ground, was erected 
and covered with black; and where the executioner 
from the Tower, and his assistant, stood, dressed 
in black velvet. The hall was full of people. 
While the sentence was being read she sat upon a 
stool, and when it was finished she again denied 
her guilt, as she had done before. The Earl of 
Kent and the Dean of Peterborough , in their Pro- 
testant zeal, made some very unnecessary speeches 
to her, to which she replied that she died in the 
Catholic religion, and they need not trouble them- 
selves about that matter. When her head and neck 
were uncovered by the executioners, she said that 
she had not been used to be undressed by such 
hands, or before so much company. Finally, one 7 
of her women fastened a cloth over her face, and 
she laid her neck upon the block, and repeated 
more than once in Latin, “Into thy hands, O Lord,

I commend my spirit!” Some say her head w&b 
struck off in two blows, some say in three. How- 
ever that be, when it was held up, streaming with 
blood, the real hair beneath the false hair she had 
long worn was seen to be as grey as that of a wo- 
man of seventy, though she was at that time only 
in her forty-sixth year. All her beauty was gone. 

But she was beautiful enough to her little dog, 
who cowered under her dress, frightened, when she 
went upon the scaffold, and who lay down beside 
her headless body when all her earthly sorrows 
were over. 


CHAPTER XXXIII. 

ENGLAND UNDER QUEEN ELIZABETH. 

On its being formally made known to Elizabeth 
that the sentence had been executed on the Queen 
of Scots, she showed the utmost grief and rage, 
drove her favorites from her with violent indigna- 
tion, and sent Davison to the Tower; from which 
place he was only released in the end by paying 
an immense fine which completely ruined him. 
Elizabeth not only over-acted her part in making 
these pretences, but most basely reduced to poverty 
one of her faithful servants, for no other fault than 
obeying her commands. 

James, King of Scotland, Mary's son, made a 
show likewise of being very angry on the occasion; 
but, as he was a pensioner of England to the

amount of five thousand pounds a year, and had 
known very little of his mother, and possibly re* 
garded her as the murderer of his father besides, 
he soon took it quietly. 

Philip, King of Spain, however, threatened to 
do greater things than ever had been done yet, to 
set up the Catholic religion and punish Protestant 
England. Elizabeth , hearing that he and the Prince 
of Parma were making great preparations for this 
purpose, in order to be beforehand with them, sent 
out Admiral Drake (a famous navigator, who had 
sailed about the world, and had already brought 
great plunder from Spain) to the port of Cadiz, 
where he burnt a hundred vessels full of stores. 
This great loss obliged the Spaniards to put off 
the invasion for a year, but it was none the less 
formidable for that, amounting to one hundred and 
thirty ships, nineteen thousand soldiers, eight thou- 
sand sailors, two thousand slaves, and between 
two and three thousand great guns. England was 
not idle in making ready to resist this great force. 
All the men between sixteen years old and sixty, 
were trained and drilled; the national fleet of ships 
(in number only thirty-four at first) was enlarged 
hy public contributions and by private ships, fitted 
out by noblemen; the City of London, of its own 
accord, furnished double the number of ships and 
men that it was required to provide; and if ever 
the national spirit was up in England it was up all 
through the country to resist the Spaniards. Some 
of the Queen’s advisers were for seizing the prin- 
cipal English Catholics, and putting them to death,

but the Queen — who, to her honor, used to say 
that she would never believe any ill of her sub- 
jects , which a parent would not believe of her own 
children — rejected the advice, and only confined 
a few of those who were the most suspected among 
them, in the fens in Lincolnshire. The great body 
of Catholics deserved this confidence; for they be- 
haved most loyally, nobly, and bravely. 

So, with all England firing up like one strong 
angry man, and with both sides of the Thames 
fortified, and with the soldiers under arms, and 
the sailors in their ships, the country waited for the 
coining of the proud Spanish fleet, which was called 
The Invincible Armada. The Queen herself, 
riding on a white horse, with armour on her back, 
and the .Earl of Essex and the Earl of Leicester 
holding her bridle rein, made a brave speech to 
the troops at Tilbury Fort opposite Gravesend, 
which was received with such enthusiasm as is 
seldom known. Then came the Spanish Armada 
into the English Channel, sailing along in the form 
of a half moon, of such great size, that it was 
seven miles broad. But the English were quickly 
upon it, and woe then to all the Spanish ships that 
dropped a little out of the half moon, for the Eng- 
lish took them instantly! And it soon appeared 
that .the great Armada was anything but invincible, 
for, on a summer night, bold Drake sent eight 
blazing fire-ships right into the midst of it In 
terrible consternation the Spaniards tried to get 
out to sea, and so became dispersed; the English 
pursued them at a great advantage; a storm cam®

on, and drove the Spaniards among rocks and 
shoals; and the swift end of the Invincible fleet 
was that it lost thirty great ships and ten thousand 
men, and, defeated and disgraced, sailed home 
again. Being afraid to go by the English Channel, 
it sealed all round Scotland and Ireland; and some 
of the ships getting cast away on the latter coast 
in bad weather, the Irish, who were a kind of 
savages, plundered . those vessels and killed their 
crews. So ended this great attempt to invade and 
conquer England; and I think it will be a long 
time before any other invincible fleet coming to 
England with the same object, will fare much better 
than the Spanish Armada. 

Though the Spanish king had had this bitter 
taste of English bravery, he was so little the wiser 
for it as still to entertain his old designs, and even 
to conceive the absurd idea of placing his daughter 
on the English throne. But the Earl of Essex, 
Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Thomas Howard, and 
Borne other distinguished leaders, putting to sea 
from Plymouth, entered the port of Cadiz once 
more, obtained a complete victory over the ship- 
ping assembled there, and got possession of the 
town. In obedience to the Queen’s express in- 
structions, they behaved with great humanity; and 
the principal loss of the Spaniards was a vast sum 
of money which they had to pay for ransom. This 
Was one of many gallant achievements on the sea, 
effected in this reign. Sir Walter Raleigh himself, 
after marrying a maid of honor and giving offence 
to the Maiden Queen thereby, had already sailed

to South America in search of gold, and written an 
excellent account of his voyage. 

The Earl of Leicester was now dead, and so 
was Sir Thomas Walsingham, whom Lord Burleigh 
was soon to follow. The principal favorite was 
the Earl of Essex , a spirited and handsome man, 
a favorite with the people too as well as with the 
Queen, and possessed of many admirable qualities. 
It was much debated at Court whether there should 
be peace with Spain or no , and he was very urgent 
for war. He also tried hard to have his own way 
in the appointment qf a deputy to govern in Ire- 
land. One day, while this question was in dispute, 
he hastily took offence, and turned his back upon 
the Queen; as a gentle reminder of which impro- 
priety, the Queen gave him a tremendous box on 
the ear, and told him to go to the devil. He went 
home instead, and did not reappear at Court for 
half a year or so, when he and the Queen were 
reconciled, though never (as some suppose) tho- 
roughly. 

From this time the fate of the Earl of Essex 
and that of the Queen seemed to be blended to- 
gether. The Irish were still perpetually quarrelling 
and fighting among themselves , and he went over 
to Ireland as Lord Lieutenant, to the great joy of 
his enemies (Sir Walter Raleigh among the rest) 
who were glad to have so dangerous a rival far oft 
Hot being by any means successful there, and 
knowing that his enemies would take advantage of 
that circumstance to injure him with the Queen, he 
came home again though against her orders. The

Queen being taken by surprise when be appeared 
before her, gave him her hand to kiss, and he was 
oveijoyed — though it was not a very lovely one 
by this time; but in the course of the same day 
she ordered him to confine himself to his room, 
and two or three days afterwards had him taken 
into custody. With the same sort of caprice — 
and as capricious an old woman she now was as 
; ever wore a crown or a head either — she sent 
him broth from her own table on his falling ill 
: from anxiety, and cried about him. 
j He was a man who could find comfort and oc- 
I cupation in his books , and he did so for a time —

} But it happened, unfortunately for him, that he 
, held a monopoly in sweet wines: which means that 

■ nobody could sell them without purchasing his per- 
j mission. This right, which was only for a term, 
I expiring, he applied to have it renewed. The Queen 
i refused, with the rather strong observation — but 

she did make strong observations — that an unruly 

■ beast must be stinted in his food. Upon this, the 
‘angry Earl who had been already deprived of many 
offices, thought himself in danger of complete ruin, 
and turned against the Queen, whom he called a 
vain old woman who had grown as crooked in her 
mind as she had in her figure. These uncompli- 
mentary expressions, the ladies of the Court im- 
mediately snapped up and carried to the Queen, 
whom they did not put in a better temper, you may 
believe. The same Court ladies, when they had 
beautiful dark hair of their own, used to wear

false red hair, to be like the Queen* Bo they 
were not very high-spirited ladies, however logh 
in rank. 

The worst object of the Earl of Essex and some 
Mends of his who used to meet at Lord South- 
ampton’s house, was to obtain possession of the 
Queen, and oblige her by force to dismiss her Ba- 
nisters and change her favorites. On Saturday the 
seventh of February, one thousand six hundred and 
one, the council suspecting this, summoned the 
Earl to come before them. He, pretending to be 
ill, declined; and it was then settled among his 
Mends, that as the next day would be Sunday 
when many of the citizens usually assembled $t 
the Cross by Saint Paul’s Cathedral, he should 
.make one bold effort to induce them to rise aud 
follow him to the Palace. 

So, on the Sunday morning, he and a small 
body of adherents started out of his house — Essex 
House by the Strand, with steps to the river 
having first shut up in it, as prisoners, some mem* 
bers of the council who came to examine him, and 
hurried into the City with the Earl at their head,* 
crying out, “For the Queen! For the Queen! A 
plot is laid for my life ! ” No one heeded them, how- 
ever, and when they came to Saint Paul’s there 
were no citizens there. In the meantime, the pri- 
soners at Essex House had been released by one 
of the Earl’s own friends; he had been promptly 
proclaimed a traitor in the City itself; and the 
streets were barricaded with carts and guarded by 
soldiers. The Earl got back to his house by water,

with great difficulty, and, after an attempt to de- 
fend it against the troops and cannon by which it 
was soon surrounded, gave himself up that night 
He was brought to trial on the nineteenth, and 
found guilty; on the twenty-fifth, he was executed 
on Tower Hill, where he died, at thirty-four years 
old, both courageously and penitently. His step- 
father suffered with him. His enemy, Sir Walter 
Raleigh, stood near the scaffold all the time — 
but not so near to it as we shall see him stand, 
before we finish his history. 

In this case, as in those of the Duke of Nor- 
folk and Mary Queen of Seots, the Queen bad 
commanded, and countermanded, and again com- 
manded, the execution. It is probable that the 
death of her young and gallant favorite, in the 
prime of his good qualities, was never off her 
mind afterwards, but she held out, the same vain, 
obstinate and capricious woman, for another year* 
Then she danced before her Court on a state oc- 
casion — and cut, I should think, a mighty ridi- 
culous figure, doing so in an immense ruff, sto- 
macher, and wig, at seventy years old. For an- 
other year still, she held out, but, without. any 
more dancing, and as a moody, sorrowful, broken 
creature. At last, on the tenth of March, one 
thousand six hundred and three, having been ill of 
* very bad cold, and made worse by the death of 
the Countess of Nottingham, who was her intimate 
friend, she fell into a stupor and was supposed to 
be dead. She recovered her consciousness, and 
then nothing would induce her to go to bed; for

she said she knew that if she did, she would never 
get up again. There she lay for ten days, on 
cushions on the floor, without any food, until flie 
Lord Admiral got her into bed at last, partly by 
persuasions and partly by main force. When they 
asked her who should succeed her, she replied that 
her seat had been the seat of Kings , and that she 
would have for her successor “No rascal’s son, but 
a King’s.” Upon this, the lords present stared at 
one another, and took the liberty of asking whom 
she meant; to which she replied, “Whom should I 
mean, but our cousin of Scotland!” This was on 
the twenty-third of March. They asked her once 
again that day, after she was speechless, whether 
she was still in the same mind? She struggled up 
in bed, and joined her hands over her head in the 
form of a crown, as the only reply she could make. 
At three o’clock next morning, she very quietly 
died, in the forty-fifth year of her reign. 

That reign had been a glorious one, and is 
made for ever memorable by the distinguished men 
who flourished in it. Apart from the great voyagers, 
statesmen, and scholars whom it produced, the 
names of Bacon, Spenser, and Shakespeare, will 
always be remembered with pride and veneration 
by the civilised world, and will always impart 
{though with no great reason, perhaps), some por- 
tion of their lustre to the name of Elizabeth. B 
was a great reign for discovery, for commerce, and 
for English enterprise and spirit in general. It was 
a great reign for the Protestant religion and for 
the Reformation which made England free. The

Queen was very popular, and in her Progresses, 
or journeys about her dominions, was everywhere 
received with the liveliest joy. I think the truth 
is, that she was not half so good as she has been 
made out, and not half so bad as she has been 
made out. She had her fine qualities, but she was 
coarse, capricious, and treacherous, and had all 
the faults of an excessively vain young woman 
long after she was an old one. On the whole, she 
had a great deal too much of her father in her, to 
please me. 

Many improvements and luxuries were intro- 
duced in the course of these five and forty years 
in the general manner of living; but cock-fighting, 
boll-baiting, and bear-baiting were still the national 
amusements; and a coach was so rarely seen, and 
was such an ugly and cumbersome affair when it 
was seen, that even the Queen herself, on many 
high occasions, rode on horseback on a pillion be- 
hind the Lord Chancellor.

Ding, covetous, wasteful, idle, drunken, greedy, 
dirty, cowardly, a great swearer, and the most con- 
ceited man on earth. His figure - — what is com- 
monly called rickety from his birth — presented 
the most ridiculous appearance that can be imagined, 
dressed in thick padded clothes, as a safeguard 
against being stabbed — of which he lived in con- 
tinual fear — of a grass -green colour from head 
to foot, with a hunting-horn dangling at the side 
instead of a sword, and his hat and feather sticking 
over one eye, or hanging on the back of his head, 
as he happened to toss it on. He used to loll on 
the necks of his favorite courtiers, and slobber 
their faces, and kiss and pinch their cheeks; and 
the greatest favorite, he ever had, used to sign him- 
self in his letters to his royal master, His Majesty’s 
“dog and slave,” and used to address his majesty as 
“his Sowship.” His majesty was the worst rider ever 
seen, and thought himself the best. He was one of 
the most impertinent talkers (in the broadest Scotch) 
ever heard, and boasted of being unanswerable in all 
manner of argument. He wrote some of the most 
wearisome treatises ever read, and thought himself 
a prodigy of authorship. He thought, and wrote, 
and said thqf a king had a right to make and un- 
make what laws he pleased, and ought to be ac- 
countable to nobody on earth. This is the plain, 
true character of the personage whom the greatest 
men about the court praised and flattered to that 
degree, that I doubt if there be anything more 
shameful in the annals of human nature. 

He came to the English throne with great ease.

The miseries of a disputed succession liad been felt 
so long 1 , and so dreadfully, that he was proclaimed 
within a few hours of Elizabeth’s death , and was 
accepted by the nation even without being asked 
to give any pledge that he would govern well, or 
that he would redress crying grievances. He took 
a month to come from Edinburgh to London; and, 
by way, I suppose, of exercising his new power, 
hanged a pickpocket on the journey without any 
trial, and knighted everybody he could lay hold of. 
He made two hundred knights before he got to his 
palace in London, and seven hundred before he had 
been in it three months. He also shovelled sixty- 
two new peers into the House of Lords — and 
there was a pretty large sprinkling of Scotchmen 
among them, you may believe. 

His Sbwship’s prime Minister, Cecil (for I can- 
not do better' than call his majesty what his favorite 
called him) was the enemy of Sir Walter Raleigh, 
and also of Sir Walter’s political friend, Lord 
Cobham; and his Sowship’s first trouble was a plot 
originated by these two , and entered into by some 
others, with the old object of seizing the King, and 
keeping him in imprisonment until he shonld change 
Ms ministers. There were Catholic priests in the 
plot, and there were Puritan noblemen too; for, 
although the Catholics and Puritans were strongly 
opposed to each other, they united at this time 
against his Sowship, because they knew that he 
bad a design against both, after pretending to be 
friendly to each; this design being to Have only 
one high and convenient form of the Protestant re-

ligion, which every body should be bound to belong 
to, whether they liked it or not. This plot was 
mixed up with another, which may or may not have 
had some reference to placing on the throne, at 
some time, the Lady Arabella Stuart, whose 
misfortune it was to be the daughter of the younger 
brother of his Sowship’s father, but who was quite 
innocent of any part in the scheme. Sir Walter 
Raleigh was accused on the confession of Lord 
Cobham — a miserable creature, who said one 
thing at one time, and another thing at another 
time, and could be relied upon in nothing. The 
trial of Sir Walter Baleigh lasted from eight in the 
morning until nearly midnight; and he defended 
himself with such eloquence, genius, and spirit 
against all accusations, and against the insults of 
Coke , the Attorney-General , who , according to the 
custom of the time, foully abused him that those 
who went there detesting the prisoner, came away 
admiring him, and declaring that anything so won- 
derful and so captivating was never heard. He was 
found guilty, nevertheless, and sentenced to death. 
Execution was deferred, however, and he was taken 
to the Tower. The two Catholic priests, less for- 
tunate, were executed, with the usual atrocity; and 
Lord Cobham and two others were pardoned on the 
scaffold. His Sowship thought it wonderfully know- 
ing in him to surprise the people by pardoning 
these three at the very block; but, blundering, and 
bungling, as usual, he had very nearly overreached 
himself. For the messenger on horseback, who 
brought the pardon, came so late, that he was

pushed to the outside of the crowd, and was obliged 
to shout and roar out what he came for. The miser- 
able Cobham did not gain much by being spared 
that day. He lived, both as a prisoner and a beg- 
gar, utterly despised, and miserably poor, for thir- 
teen years, and then died in an old out-house be- 
longing to one of his former servants. 

This plot got rid of, and Sir Walter Raleigh 
safely shut up in the Tower, his Sowship held a 
great dispute with the Puritans on their presenting 
a petition to him, and had it all his own way — 
not so very wonderful, as he would talk continually, 
and would not hear anybody else — and filled the 
Bishops with admiration. It was comfortably set- 
titci that there was to be only one form of religion, 
and that all men were to think exactly alike. But, 
akhough this was arranged two centuries and a 
half ago , and although the arrangement was sup- 
ported by much fining and imprisonment, I do not 
find that it is quite successful, even yet. 

His Sowship, having that uncommonly high 
opinion of himself as a king, had a very low opi- 
nion of Parliament, as a power that audaciously 
wanted to control him. When he called his first 
Parliament after he had been king a year, he ac- 
cordingly thought he would take pretty high ground 
with them, and told them that he commanded them 
“as an absolute king.” The Parliament thought 
these strong words, and saw the necessity of up- 
holding their authority. His Sowship had three 
children: Prince Henry, Prince Charles, and the 
Princess Elizabeth. It would have been well for

one of these ; end we shall too soon see which, if 
he had learnt a little wisdom concerning Parlia- 
ments from his father’s obstinacy. 

Now, the people still labouring under their old 
dread of the Catholic religion, this Parliament re- 
vived and strengthened the severe laws against it 
And this so angered Robert Catesby, a restless 
Catholic gentleman of an old family, that he formed 
one of the most desperate and terrible designs ever 
conceived in the mind of man; no less a scheme 
than the Gunpowder Plot 

Hid object was, when the King, lords, and com- 
mons , should be assembled at the next opening of 
Parliament, to blow them up, one and all, with a 
great mine of gunpowder. The first person to whom 
he confided this horrible idea was Thomas Winteb, 
a Worcestershire gentleman who had served in the 
army abroad , and had been secretly employed in 
Catholic projects. While Winter was yet undecided, 
and when he had gone over to the Netherlands, to 
learn from the Spanish Ambassador there, whether 
there was any hope of Catholics being relieved 
through the intercession of the King of Spain with 
his Sowship, he found at Ostend a tall, dark, daring 
man, whom he had known when they were both 
soldiers abroad, and whose name was Guido * — or 
Guy — Fawkes. Resolved -to join the plot, he 
proposed it to this man, knowing him to be the man 
for any desperate deed, and they came hack to 
England together. Here, they admitted two other 
conspirators: Thomas Percy, related to the Earl 
of Northumberland, and John Wright, his brother-

in-law. All these met together in a solitary house 
in the open fields , which were then near Clement’s 
Inn, now a closely blocked-up part of London; and 
when they had all taken a great oath of secrecy, 
Catesby told the rest what his plan was. They then 
went up stairs into a garret and received the Sa- 
crament from Father Gerard, a Jesuit, who is 
said not to have known actually of the Gunpowder 
Hot, but who, I think, must have had his suspi- 
cions that there was something desperate afoot. 

Percy was a Gentleman Pensioner, and as he 
had occasional duties to perform about the Court, 
then kept at Whitehall, there would be nothing 
suspicious in his living at Westminster. So, having 
looked well about him, and having found a house 
to let, the back of which joined the Parliament 
House, he hired it of a person named Ferris, for 
the' purpose of undermining the wall. Having got 
possession of this house, the conspirators hired an- 
other on the Lambeth side of the Thames, which 
they used as a storehouse for wood, gunpowder, 
and other combustible matters. These were to be 
removed at night (and afterwards were removed), 
bit by bit, to the house at Westminster; and,* that 
there might be some trusty person to keep watch 
over the Lambeth stores, they admitted another 
conspirator, by name Robert Kay, a very poor Ca- 
tholic gentleman. 

All these arrangements had been made some 
months , and it was a dark wintry December night, 
when the conspirators, who had been in the mean-

house at Westminster, and began to dig. They 
had laid in a good stock of eatables, to avoid going 
in and out, and they dug and dug with great ardour. 
But, the wall being tremendously thick, and the 
work very severe, they took in Christopher Wright, 
a younger brother of John Wright, that they might 
have a new pair of hands to help. And Christopher 
Wright fell to like a fresh man, and they dug and 
dug by night and by day, and Fawkes stood sen- 
tinel all the time. And if any man’s heart seemed 
to fail him at all, Fawkes said, “Gentlemen, we 
have abundance of powder and shot here, and there 
is no fear of our being taken alive, even if dis- 
covered.” The same Fawkes, who, in his capacity 
of sentinel, was always prowling about, soon picked 
up the intelligence that the King had prorogued 
the Parliament again, from the seventh of February, 
the day first fixed upon, until the third of October. 
When the conspirators knew this, they agreed to 
separate until after the Christmas holidays, and to 
take no notice of each other in the meanwhile, and 
never to write letters to one another, on any ac- 
count. So, the house in Westminster was shut up 
again, and I suppose the neighbours thought that 
those strange looking men who lived there so gloo- 
mily and went out so seldom, were gone away to 
have a merry Christmas somewhere. 

It was the beginning of February, sixteen hun- 
dred and five, when Catesby met his fellow con- 
spirators again at this Westminster house. He had 
now admitted three more: John Grant, a Warwick- 
shire gentleman of a melancholy temper, who lived

in a doleful house near Stratford - upon - Avon, with 
a frowning wall all round it, and a deep moat; 
Bobebt Winteb, eldest brother of Thomas; and 
Catesby’s own servant, Thomas Bates, who, Cates- 
by thought, had had some suspicion of what his 
master was about These three had all suffered 
more or less, for their religion, in Elizabeth’s time. 
And now they all began to dig again, and they 
dug and dug by night and by day. 

They found it dismal work alone there, under- 
ground, with such a fearful secret on their minds, 
and so many murders before them. They were 
filled with wild fancies. Sometimes, they thought 
they heard a great bell tolling, deep down in the 
earth under the Parliament House; sometimes, they 
thought they heard low voices muttering about the 
Gunpowder Plot; and once in the morning, they 
really did hear a great rumbling noise over their 
heads, as they dug and sweated in their mine. 
Every man stopped and looked aghast at his neigh- 
bour, wondering what had happened, when that 
bold prowler, Fawkes, who had been out to look, 
came in and told them that it was only a dealer in 
coals who had occupied a cellar under the Parlia- 
ment House, removing his stock in trade to some 
ether place. Upon this, the conspirators, who with 
all their digging and digging had not yet dug 
through the tremendously thick wall, changed their 
plan, hired that cellar, which was directly under 
the House of Lords, put six -and -thirty barrels of 
gunpowder in it, and covered them over with fag- 
gots and coals. Then they Ad dispersed again

until September, when the following new conspira- 
tors were admitted: Sir Edward Baynham, of Glou- 
cestershire; Sir Edward Dioby, of Rutlandshire; 
Ambrose Rookwood, of Suffolk; and Francis Tee- 
sham, of Northamptonshire. Most of these were 
rich, and were to assist the plot, some with money 
and spme with horses, on which the conspirators 
were to ride through the country and rouse the 
Catholics, after the Parliament should be blown 
into the air* 

Parliament being again prorogued from the third 
of October to the fifth of November, and the con- 
spirators being uneasy lest their design should hare 
been found out, Thomas Winter said he would go 
up into the House of Lords on the day of the pro- 
rogation and see how matters looked. Nothing could 
be better. The unconscious Commissioners were 
walking about, and talking to one another, just over 
the six-mid-thirty barrels of gunpowder. He came 
back, and told the rest so, and they went on with 
their preparations. They hired a ship , and kept it 
ready in the Thames’ in which Fawkes was to sail 
for Flanders after firing with a slow match the train 
that was to explode the powder. A number" of Ca- 
tholic gentlemen not in the secret, were invited, on 
pretence of a hunting-party, to meet Sir Edward 
Digby at Dunchurch on the fatal day, that they 
might be ready to act together. And now all was 
ready. 

But, now, the great weakness and danger which 
had been all along at the bottom of this wicked 
plot began to show itself. As the fifth of Novem*

ber drew near, most of the conspirators remembering 
that they had friends and relations who weald be 
in the Souse of Lords that day, felt some natural 
relenting, and a wish to warn them to keep away. 
They were not much comforted by Gatesby’s de- 
claring that in such a cause he would blow up his 
own son. Loan Mounteagle , Tresham’s brother- 
in-law, was certain to be in the house, and when 
Tresham found that he could not prevail upon the 
rest to devise any means of sparing their friends, 
he wrote a mysterious letter to this lord and left 
it at his lodging in the dusk, urging him to keep 
away from the opening of Parliament, “since God 
and man had concurred to punish the wickedness 
of the times. 1 ’ It contained the words “that the 
Parliament should receive a terrible blow, and yet 
should not see who hurt them,” and it added, “the 
danger is past, as soon as you have burnt the 
letter.” 

The ministers and courtiers made out that his 
Sowship, by a direct miracle from Heaven, found 
out what; this letter meant. The truth is, that they 
were not long (as few men would be) in finding it 
out for themselves , and that it was decided to let 
the conspirators alone, until the very day before 
the opening of Parliament. That the conspirators 
had their fears, is certain; for, Tresham himself 
said before them all, that they were every one dead 
men; and, although even he hid not take Sight, 
there is reason to suppose that he had warned other 
persons besides Lord Mounteagle. However, they 
were all firm, and Fawkes, who was a man of iron,

went down every day and night to keep watch in 
the cellar as usual. He was there about two in the 
afternoon of the fourth, when the Lord Chamberlain 
and Lord Mounteagle threw open the door and 
looked in. “Who are you, friend?” said they. 
“Why,” said Fawkes, “I am Mr. Percy’s servant, 
and am looking after his store of fuel here.” “Yonr 
master has laid in a pretty good store,” they re- 
turned, and shut the door, and went away. Fawkes, 
upon this , posted off to the other conspirators to 
tell them all was quiet, and went back and shut 
himself up in the dark black cellar again, where 
he heard the bell go twelve o’clock and usher in 
the fifth of November. About two hours afterwards 
he slowly opened the door, and came out to look 
about him, in his old prowling way. He was ifr 
stantly seized and bound, by a party of soldiers 
under Sir Thomas Knevett. He had a watch upon 
him, some touchwood, some tinder, some slow 
matches ; and there was a dark-lantern with a candle 
in it, lighted, behind the door. He had his boots 
and spurs on — to ride to the ship , I suppose — 
and it was well for the soldiers that they took him 
so suddenly; for if they had left him but a moment’s 
time to light a match, he certainly would have toss- 
ed it in among the powder, and blown himself and 
them to perdition. 

They took him to the King’s bed-chamber first 
of all; and there the King (causing him to be held 
very tight, and keeping a good way off) asked hi® 
how he could have had the heart to intend to de- 
stroy so many innocent people? “Because,” said

Guy Fawkes, “desperate diseases need desperate 
remedies. 9 ’ To a little Scotch favorite, with a face 
like a terrier, who asked him (with no particular 
wisdom) why he had collected so much gunpowder, 
lie replied, because he had meant to blow Scotch- 
men back to Scotland, and it would take a good 
deal of powder to do that Next day he was car- 
ried to the Tower, but would make no confession. 
Even after being horribly tortured he confessed 
nothing that the Government did not already know, 
though he must have been in a fearful state — as 
his signature, still preserved, in contrast with his 
natural hand -writing before he was put upon the 
dreadful rack, most frightfully shows. Bates, a very 
different man, soon said the Jesuits had had to do 
with the plot, and probably, under the torture, would 
have soon said anything. Tresham, taken and put 
in the Tower too, made confessions and unmade 
them, and died of an illness that was heavy upon 
him. Bookwood, who had stationed relays of his 
own horses all the way to Dunchurch, did not mount 
to escape until the middle of the day, when the news 
of the plot was all over London. On the road, he 
came up with the two Wrights, Catesby, and Percy; 
end they all galloped together into Northampton- 
shire. Thence to Dunchurch, where they found the 
proposed party assembled. Finding, however, that 
there had been a plot, and that it had been dis- 
covered, the party disappeared in the course of the 
night, and left them alone with Sir Everard Digby. 
Away they all rode again, through Warwickshire 
and Worcestershire, to a house called Holbeach on

the borders of Staffordshire. They tried to. raise the 
Catholics on their way, but were indignantly driven 
off .by them. All this time they were hotly pursued 
by the sheriff of Worcester, and a fast increasing 
concourse of riders. At last, resolving to defend- 
themselves, at Holbeaeh, they shut themselves up 
in the house, mid put some wet powder before the 
fire to dry. But it blew up, and Catesby was ringed 
and blackened, and almost killed, and -some of the 
others were sadly hurt. Still, knowing that they 
must die, they resolved to die there, and with only 
their Swords in their hands appeared at the win- 
dows to be shot at by the sheriff and his assistants. 
Catesby said to Thomas Winter, after Thomas had 
been hit in the right arm which dropped powerless 
by his ride, “Stand by me, Tom, and we wdl die 
together!” — which they did, being shot through 
the body by two bullets from one gun. John Wright, 
mid Christopher Wright, and Percy, were also shot. 
Rookwood and Digby were taken: the former with 
a broken arm and a wound in his body too. 

It was the fifteenth of January before the trial 
of Guy Fawkes, and such of the other conspirators 
as were left alive, came on. They were all found 
guilty, all hanged, drawn and quartered: some in 
St. Paul’s Churchyard, on the top of Ludgate HilU 
and some before the Parliament House. A Jesuit 
priest, named Henry Garnet, to whom the bloody 
design was said to have been communicated, was 
taken and tried, and two of his servants, as well 
as a poor priest who was taken with him, were 
tortured without mercy. He himself was not tox-

tnred, but was surrounded in the Tower by tam- 
perers and traitors, and so made unfairly to con- 
vict himself out of his own mouth. He said, upon 
his trial, that he had done all he could to prevent 
the deed, and that he could not make public what 
had been told him in confession — though I am 
afraid he knew of the plot in other ways. He was 
found guilty and executed, after a manful defence, 
and the Catholic Church made a saint of him*, some 
rich and powerful persons, who had had nothing to 
do with the project, were fined and imprisoned for 
it by the Star Chamber. The Catholics, in general, 
who bad recoiled with horror from the idea of the 
infernal contrivance, were unjustly put under more 
severe laws than before; and this was the end of 
the Gunpowder Plot

His Sowship would pretty willingly, I think, 
have blown the House of Commons 'into the air 
himself; for his dread and jealousy of it knew no 
bounds aU through his reign. When he was hard 
pressed for money he was obliged to order it to

At one time lie wanted it to consent to the Union 
of England with Scotland, and quarrelled about 
that. At another time it wanted him to put down 
a most infamous Church abuse, called the High 
Commission Court, and he quarrelled with it about 
that. At another time it entreated him not' to be 
quite so fond of his archbishops and bishops who 
made speeches in his praise too awful to be re- 
lated, but to haye some little consideration for the 
poor Puritan clergy who were persecuted for preach- 
ing in their own way, and not according to the 
archbishops and bishops ; and they quarrelled about 
that. In short, what with hating the House of 
Commons, and pretending not to hate it; and what 
with now sending some of its members who opposed 
him, to Newgate, or to the Tower, and now telling 
the rest that they must not presume to make speeches 
about the public affairs, which could not possibly 
eoncern them; and what with cajoling, and bully- 
ing, and frightening, and being frightened j the 
House of Commons was the plague of his Sow- 
ship’s existence. It was pretty firm, however, in 
maintaining its rights, and in insisting that the 
Parliament should make the laws, and not the 
King by his own single proclamation (which he 
tried hard to do); and his Sowship was often so 
distressed for money, in consequence, that he sold 
-every sort of title and public office as if they were 
merchandise, and even invented a new dignity 
called a Baronetcy which anybody could buy ft* 
a thousand pounds.

hunting , and his drinking, and his lying in bed 
— for he was a great sluggard — occupied his Sow- 
ship pretty well. The rest of his time he chiefly 
passed in hugging and slobbering bis favorites. 
The first of these was Sir Philip Herbert, who 
had no knowledge whatever, except of dogs, and 
horses, and bunting, but whom be soon made Earl 
of Montgomery. The next, and a much more 
famous one, was Robert Carr, or Ker, (for it is 
not certain which was bis right name), who came 
from the Border country, and whom he soon made 
Viscount Rochester, and afterwards, Earl of 
Somerset. The way in which his Sowship doated 
on this handsome young man, is even more odious 
to think of, than the way in which the really great 
men of England condescended to how down before 
him. His great friend was a certain Sir Thomas 
Ovebbury, who wrote his love-letters for him and 
assisted him in the duties of his many high places, 
which his own ignorance prevented him from dis- 
charging. But this same Sir Thomas having just 
manhood enough to dissuade the favorite from a 
wicked marriage with the beautiful Countess of 
Essex, who was to get a divorce from her husband 
for the purpose; the said Countess, in her rage, 
got Sir Thomas put into the Tower, and there 
poisoned him. Then the favorite and this bad wo- 
man were publicly married by the King’s pet bi- 
shop, with as much to-do and rejoicing, as if he 
had been the best man, and she the best woman, 
upon the face of the earth. 

But, after a longer sunshine than might have

been expected — of seven years or so, that is to 
say — another handsome young man started op 
and eclipsed die Earl op Somerset. This was 
George Villiers , the youngest son of a Leicester- 
shire gentleman: who came to Court with afi the 
Paris fashions on him, and could dance as well as 
the best mountebank that ever was. seem He soon 1 
danced himself into the good graces of his Sow- 
ship, and danced the other favorite out of fever. 
Then, it was sH at once discovered that the Earl 
and Countess of Somerset had not deserved all 
those great promotions and mighty rejoicings, sad 
they were separately tried for the murder of Sir 
Thomas Overbury, and for other crimes. But, the 
King was so horribly afraid of his late favorite’s 
publicly telling some disgraceful things he knew 
of him — which he darkly threatened to do — 
that he was even examined with two men standing, 
one on either side of him , each with a cloak in Ins 
hand, ready to throw it over his head and stop Ins 
mouth if he should break out with what he had H 
in his power to tell. ' So, a very lame affair was 
purposely made of the trial, and Ids punishment 
was an allowance of four thousand pounds a year 
in retirement; while the countess was pardoned and 
allowed to pass into retirement too. They hated 
one another by this time, and lived to revSe and 
torment each other some years. 

While these events were in progress , and wide 
his Sowship was making such an exhibition of Urn* 
self, from day to day and from year to year, as 
is not often seen in any sty, three remarkable

deaths took place in England. The first was that 
of the Minister, Robert Oecil, Earl of Salisbury, 
who was past sixty, and had never been strong, 
being deformed from his birth. He said at last 
that he had no wish to live: and no Minister need 
have had, I am sure, with his experience of the 
meanness and wickedness of those disgraceful times. 
The second was, that of the Lady Arabella Stuart, 
the alarmed his Sowship mightily, by privately 
marrying William Seymour, son of Lord Beau* 
champ, who was a descendant of King Henry the 
Seventh, and who, his Sowship thought, might con- 
sequently increase and strengthen any claim she 
might one day set up to the throne. She was se- 
parated from her husband (who was put in the 
Tower) and crammed into a boat to be confined at 
Durham. She escaped in a man’s dress to get away 
in a French ship from Gravesend to France, but 
unhappily missed her husband, who had escaped 
too, and was soon taken. She went raving mad in 
the miserable Tower, and died there after four years. 
The last, and the most important of these three 
deaths, was that of Prince Henry, the heir to the 
throne, in the nineteenth year of his age. He was 
a promising yonng prince, and greatly liked: a 
quiet, well-conducted youth, of whom two very good 
things are known; first, that his father was jealous 
of him; secondly, that he was the friend of Sir 
Walter Raleigh, languishing through all those years 
in the Tower, and often said that no man but his 
fr&er would keep such a bird in such a cage. On 
the occasion of the preparations for the marriage of

his sister the Princess Elizabeth with a foreign 
prince (and an unhappy marriage it turned out) he 
came from Richmond, where he had been very ill, 
to greet his new brother-in-law, at the palace at 
Whitehall. There he played a great game at ten- 
nis, in his shirt, though it was very cold weather, j 
and was seized with an alarming illness and died 
within a fortnight of a putrid fever. For this young ! 
prince Sir Walter Raleigh wrote, in his prison in 
the Tower, the beginning of a History of the World: 
a wonderful instance how little his Sowship could 
do to confine a great man’s mind, however long he 
might imprison his body. 

And this mention of Sir Walter Raleigh, who 
had many faults, but who’ never showed so many 
merits as in trouble and adversity, may bring me 
at once to the end of his sad story. After an im- 
prisonment in the Tower of twelve long years, he 
proposed to resume those old sea voyages of his, 
and go to South America in search of gold. His 
Sowship, divided between his wish to be on good 
terms with the Spaniards through whose territory 
Sir Walter must pass — he had long had an idea 
of marrying Prince Henry to a Spanish Princess — 
and his avaricious eagerness to get hold of the gold, 
did not know what to do. But, in the end, he set 
Sir Walter free, taking securities for his return; and 
Sir Walter fitted out an expedition at his own cost, 
and, on the twenty-eighth of Mareh, one thousand 
six hundred and seventeen, sailed away in command 
of one of its ships , which he ominously called the 
Destiny. The expedition failed; the common men.

not finding the gold they had expected, mutinied; 
a quarrel broke out between Sir Walter and the 
Spaniards, who hated him for old successes of his 
against them; and he took and burnt a little town 
called Saint Thomas. For this he was denounced 
to his Sowship by the Spanish Ambassador as a 
pirate, and returning almost broken-hearted, with 
Us hopes and fortunes shattered, his company . of 
friends dispersed, and his brave son (who had been 
one of them) killed, he was taken through the 
treachery of Sir Lewis Stujkely, his near relation, 
a scoundrel and a Vice-Admiral; and was once again 
immured in his prison-home of so many years. 

His Sowship being mightily disappointed in not 
getting any gold, Sir Walter Raleigh was tried as 
unfairly, and with as many lies and evasions as 
the judges and law officers and every other autho- 
rity in Church and State habitually practised under 
such a King. After a great deal of prevarication 
on all parts but his own, it was declared that he 
must die under his former sentence, now fifteen 
years old. So, on the twenty- eighth of October, 
one thousand six hundred and eighteen, he was 
shut up in the Gate House at Westminster to pass 
his last night on earth, and there he took leave of 
his good and faithful lady, who was worthy to have 
lived in better days. At eight o'clock next morn- 
ing, after a cheerful breakfast, and a pipe, and a 
cup of good wine, he was taken to Old Palace 
Yard in Westminster , where the scaffold was set 
np, and where so many people of high degree were 
assembled to see him die, that it was a matter of

some difficulty to get him through the ceo#<L He 
behaved most nobly; but, if anything lay heavy on 
his mind, it vras that Earl of Essex, 'whose head he 
had seen roll off; and he solemnly said that he had 
had no hand in bringing him to the block, and that 
he had shed tears for him when he died. As the 
morning was very cold, the Sheriff said, would he 
come down to a fire for a little space and warn 
himself? But Sir Walter thanked him, and said no, 
he would rather it were done at once: for he was 
ill of fever and ague, and in another quarter of an 
hour his shaking fit would come upon him if he 
were still alive, and his enemies might then suppose 
that he trembled for fear. With that, he kneeled and 
made a very beautiful and Christian prayer. Before 
he laid his head upon the block, he felt the edge 
of the axe, and said, with a smile upon his face, 
that it was a sharp medicine, but would cure the 
worst disease. When he was bent down ready fa 
death, he said to the executioner, finding that he 
hesitated, “What dost thou fear? Strike, man!” 
So, the axe came down and struck his head o$ in 
the sixty-sixth year of his age. 

The new favorite got on fast. He was made a 
viscount, he was made Duke of Buckingham, he 
was made a marquis, he was made Master of the 
Horse, he was made Lord High Admiral — wd

placed to make room for him. He had the whole 
kingdom at his disposal, and his mother sold all

kept a stop. He biased all oyer with diamonds 
sod other precious stones, from his hat-band and 
ids ear-rings to his shoes. Yet he was an ignorant, 
presumptuous, swaggering compound of knave and 
fool, with nothing but his beauty and his dancing 
to recommend him. This is the gentleman who 
called himself his Majesty's dog and slave, and 
called his Majesty Your Sowship. His Sowship 
called him Steenie; it is supposed, because that 
was a nickname for Stephen, and because Saint 
Stephen was generally represented in pictures as 
a handsome saint. 

His Sowship was driven sometimes to his wits - 
end by his trimming between the general dislike 
of die Catholic religion at home, and his desire to 
wheedle and flatter it abroad, as bis only means 
of getting a rich princess for his son’s wife: a part 
of whose fortune he might cram into his greasy 
pockets. Prince Charles — or as his Sowship call- 
ed him, Baby Charles — being now Prince of 
Wales, the old project of a marriage with the 
Spanish King’s daughter had been revived for him; 
end as she could not marry a Protestant without 
leave from the Pope, his Sowship himself secretly 
and meanly wrote to his Infallibility, asking for it. 
The negotiation for this Spanish marriage takes up 
a larger space in great books than you can imagine, 
W the upshot of it all , is , that when it had been 
held off by the Spanish Court for a long time, Baby 
Chwles and Steenie set off in disguise as Mr. Tho- 
foas Smith and Mr. John Smith, to see the Spanish 
Princess ; that Baby Charles pretended to be des-

perately in love with her, and jumped off walls to 
look at her, and made a considerable idiot of him’ 
self in a good many ways; that she was called 
Princess of Wales, and that the whole Spanish 
Court believed Baby Charles to be all but dying 
for her sake, as he expressly told them he was; 
that Baby Charles and Steenie came back to Eng- 
land, and were received with as much rapture as 
if they had been a blessing to it; that Baby 
Charles had actually fallen in love with Henrietta 
Maria, the French King’s sister, whom he had seen 
in Paris; that he thought it a wonderfully fine and 
princely thing to have deceived the Spaniards, all 
through; and that he openly said, with a chuckle, 
as soon as he was safe and sound at home again, 
that the Spaniards were great fools to have be- 
lieved him. 

Like most dishonest men, the Prince and the 
favorite complained that the people whom they had 
deluded were dishonest. They made such misre- 
presentations of the treachery of the Spaniards in 
this business of the Spanish match, that the English 
nation became eager for a war with them. Although 
the gravest Spaniards laughed at the idea of his 
Sowhip in a warlike attitude, the Parliament granted 
money for the beginning of hostilities, and the trea- 
ties with Spain were publicly declared to be at an 
end. The Spanish ambassador in London — P r0 ‘ 
bably with the help of the fallen favorite, the Earl 
of Somerset — being unable to obtain speech with 
his Sowship, slipped a paper into his hand, de- 
claring that he was a prisoner in his own house

and was entirely governed by Buckingham and his 
creatures. The first effect of this letter was, that 
his Sowship began to cry and whine, and took 
Baby Charles away from Steenie , and went down, 
to Windsor, gabbling all sorts of nonsense. The 
end of it was that his Sowship hugged his dog and 
slave, and said he was quite satisfied. 

He had given the Prince and the favorite almost 
unlimited power to settle anything with the Pope 
as to the Spanish marriage; and he now, with a 
view to the French one, signed a treaty that all 
Roman Catholics in England should exercise their 
religion freely, and should never be required to take 
any oath contrary thereto. In return for this, and 
for other concessions much less to be defended, 
Henrietta Maria was to become the Prince’s wife, 
and was to bring him a fortune of eight hundred 
thousand crowns. 

His Sowship’s eyes were getting red with eagerly

ed on this King, and the vice and corruption that 
such a barefaced habit of lying produced in his 
court. It is much to be doubted whether one man

of dishonesty and corruption; and in his base flat-

CHAPTER XXXVI 

ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST. 

Baby Charles became King Charles the 
First, in the twenty- fifth year of bis age. Tin - 
like bis father, he was usually amiable in his pri- 
vate character, and grave and dignified in W® 
bearing; but,, like his father, he bad monstrously 
exaggerated notions of the rights of a king; sad 
was evasive, and not to be trusted. If his word 
eould have been relied upon, bis history might 
have bad a different end. 

His first care was to send over that insolent 
upstart, Buckingham, to bring Henrietta Mans 
from Paris to be his Queen; upon which occasion 
Buckingham — with his usual audacity — made 
love to the young Queen of Austria, and was very 
indignant indeed with Cardinal Richelieu, the 
French Minister, for thwarting his intentions. Thfi 
English people were very well disposed to like 
their new Queen, and to receive her with great 
favor when she came among them as a stranger* 
But, she held the Protestant religion in great dis-

like, and brought over a crowd of unpleasant 
priests, who made her do some very ridiculous 
things, and forced themselves upon the public no- 
tice in many disagreeable ways. Hence, the people 
soon came to dislike her, and she soon came to 
disl&e them;' and she did so much all through this 
reign in setting the King (who was dotingly fond 
of her) againBt his subjects, that it would have 
been better for him if she had never been bom. 

Now, you are to understand that King Charles 
the First — of his own determination to be a high 
and mighty King not to be called to account by 
anybody, and urged on by his Queen besides — 
deliberately set himself to put his Parliament down 
and to put himself up. You are also to understand, 
that even in pursuit of this wrong idea — enough 
in itself to have ruined any king — he never took 
a straight course, but always took a crooked one. 

He was bent upon waif with Spain, though 
neither the House of Commons nor the people were 
quite clear as to the justice of that war , now that 
they began to think a little more about the story 

the Spanish match. But the King rushed into 
it hotly, raised money by illegal means to meet 
its expenses, and encountered a miserable failure 
nt Cadiz in the very first year of his reign. An 
expedition to Cadiz had been made 'in the hope of 
plunder, but as it was not successful it was ne- 
cessary to get a grant of money from the Parlia- 
ment, and when they met — in no very complying 
humour — the King told them, “to make haste to 
let him have it, or it would be the worse for them-

selves.” Not put in a more complying Humour by 
this , they impeached the King’s favorite* the Duke 
of Buckingham , as the cause (which he undoubtedly 
was) of many great public grievances and wrongs. 
The King to save him dissolved the Parliament 
without getting the money he wanted; and when 
the Lords implored him to consider and grant a 
little delay, he replied “No, not one minute.” He 
then began to raise money for himself by the fol- 
lowing means among others. 

He levied certain duties called tonnage and 


poundage which had not been granted by the Par- 
liament, and could lawfully be levied by no other 
power; he called upon the sea port towns to furnish, 
and to pay all the costs for three months of a 
fleet of armed ships ; and he required the people to 
unite in lending him large sums of money, the re- 
payment of which was very doubtful. If the poor 
people refused, they were pressed as soldiers or 
sailors; if the gentry refused, they were sent to 
prison. Five gentlemen , named Sir Thomas Darnel, 
John Corbet, Walter Earl, John Hevemno- 


ham, and Everard Hampden, for refusing were 
taken up by a warrant of the King’s privy council) 
and sent to prison without any cause but the Kings 
pleasure being stated for their imprisonment Then 
the question came to be solemnly tried, whether 
this was not a violation of Magna Charta, and an 
encroachment by the King on the highest rights of 
the English people. Hia lawyers contended No, 
because to encroach upon the rights of the 
lish people would be to do wrong, and the Eng

-could do no wrong. The accommodating judges 
decided in favor of this wicked nonsense; and here 
was a fatal division between the King and the 
people. 

For all this, it became necessary to call an- 
other Parliament. The people , sensible of the danger 
in which their liberties were , chose for it those who 
were best known for their determined opposition to 
the King; but still the King, quite blinded by his 
determination to carry everything before him, ad- 
dressed them when they met in a contemptuous 
manner, and just told them, in so many words, 
that he had only called them together because he 
wanted money. The Parliament, strong enough 
and resolute enough to know that they would lower 
bis tone, cared little for what he said, and laid be- 
fore him one of the great documents of history, 
which is called the Petition of Right, requiring 
that the free men of England should no longer be 
called upon to lend the King money, and should 
no longer be pressed or imprisoned for refusing to 
do so; further, that the free men of England should 
*10 longer be seized by the King’s special mandate 
or warrant, it being contrary to their rights and 
liberties and the laws of their country. At first the 
King returned an answer to this petition, in which 
be tried to shirk it altogether; but, the House of 
Commons then showing their determination to go 
on with the impeachment of Buckingham, the King, 
*n alarm, returned an answer, giving his consent 

all that was required of him. He not only after-

points, over and over again; but, at this very time, 
he did the mean and dissembling act of publishing 
his first answer and not. his second — merely that 
the people might suppose that the Parliament had 
not got the better- of him. 

That pestilent Buckingham, to gratify his own 
wounded vanity, had by this time involved the 
country in war with France, as well as with Spam. 
For such miserable causes and such miserable crea- 
tures are wars sometimes made! But he was destined 
to do little more mischief in this world. One morn- 
ing as he was going out of his house to his canjage, 
he turned to speak to a certain Colonel Fryer who 
was with him; and was violently stabbed with a 
knife, which the murderer left sticking in his heart 
This happened in his hall. He had had angry 
words upstairs, just before, with some French gen- 
tlemen, who were immediately suspected, by hit 
servants, and had a close escape from being set 
upon and killed. In the midst of the noise, the 
real murderer, who had gone to the kitchen, and 
might easily have got away, drew his sword and 
cried out, “I am the man!" His name was John 
Felton, a Protestant and a retired officer in the 
army. He said he had had no personal ill will to 
the Duke, but had killed him as a curse to the 
country. He had aimed his blow well, for Bucking- 
ham had only had time to cry out, “Villain!” and 
then he drew out the knife, fell against a tablet 
and died. 

The- council made a mighty business of ex- 
amining John Felton about this murder, though it

w» a plain case enough, one would think. He 
had come seventy miles to do it, he told them, 
aid he did it for the reason he had declared; and 
if they put him upon the rack, as that noble Mar- 
quis of Dorset whom he saw before him, had the 
goodness to threaten, he gave that marquis warn- 
ing, that he would accuse him as his accomplice. 
The King was unpleasantly anxious to have him 
racked nevertheless; but as the judges bow found 
out that torture was contrary to the law of Eng- 
land — it is a pity they did not make the dis- 
covery a little sooner — John Felton was simply 
.executed for the murder he had done. A murder 
it undoubtedly was , and not in the least to be de- 
fended: though he had freed England from one of 
the most profligate, contemptible, and base court 
favorites to whom it has ever yielded. 

A very different man how arose. This was Sir 
Thomas Wentworth , a Yorkshire gentleman, who 
had sat in Parliament for a long time , and who 
had favored arbitrary and haughty principles, hut 
who had gone over to the people’s side on receiving 
offence from Buckingham. The King, much want- 
hag such a man — for, besides being naturally fa- 
vorable to the King’s cause, he had great abilities — * 
Blade him first a Baron, and then a Viscount, and 
gave him high employment, and won him most 
completely. 

A Parliament, however, was still in existence* 
and was not to be won. On the twentieth of Ja- 
nuary, one thousand six hundred and twenty-nine.

in the Petition of Eight, bronght forward other 
strong resolutions against the King's chief instru- 
ments, and called upon the Speaker to put them 
to the vote. To this the Speaker answered, “he 
was commanded otherwise by the King," and got 
up, to leave the chair — which, according to the 
roles of the House of Commons, would have ob- 
liged it to adjourn without doing anything more — 
when two members, named Mr. Hollis and Mr. 
Valentine, held him down. A scene of great con- 
fusion arose among the members, and while man y 
swords were drawn and flashing about, the King, 
who was kept informed of all that was going on, 
told the captain of his guard to go down to the 
House and force the doors. The resolutions were 
by that time, however, voted, and the House ad- 
journed. Sir John Eliot and those two members 
who had held the Speaker down, were quickly 
summoned before the council. As they claimed it 
to be their privilege not to answer out of Parlia- 
ment for anything they had said in it, they were 
committed to the Tower. The King then went 
down and dissolved the Parliament, in a speech 
wherein he made mention of these gentlemen as 
“Vipers" — which did v not do him much good that 
ever I have heard of. 

As they refused to gain their liberty by saying 
they were sorry for what they had done, the King, 
always remarkably unforgiving, never overlooked 
their offence. When they demanded to be brought 
up before the Court of King’s Bench, he even re- 
sorted to the meanness of having them moved about

from prison to prison, so that the writs issued for 
that purpose should not legally find them. At last 
they came before the court and were sentenced to 
heavy fines, and to he imprisoned during the King’s 
pleasure. When Sir John Eliot’s health had quite 
given way, and he so longed for change of air 
and scene as to petition for his release, the King 
sent back the answer (worthy of his Sowship him- 
sdf) that the petition was not humble enough. 
When he sent another petition by his young son, 
in which he pathetically offered to go back to pri- 
son when his health was restored, if he might be 
released for its recovery, the King still disregarded 
it When he died in the Tower, and his children 
petitioned to be allowed to take his body down to 
Cornwall, there to lay it among the ashes of his 
forefathers, the King returned for answer, “Let 
Sir John Eliot’s body be buried in the church of 
that parish where he died.” All this was like a 
▼ery little King indeed, I think. 

And now, for twelve long years, steadily pur- 
suing his design of setting himself up and putting 
the people down, the King called no Parliament, 
but ruled without one. If twelve thousand volumes 
were written in his praise (as a good many have 
been) it would still remain a fact, impossible to be 
denied, that for twelve years King Charles the 
First reigned in England unlawfully and despoti- 
cally, seized upon his subjects’ goods and money 
at his pleasure, and punished, according to his un- 
bridled will, all who ventured to oppose him. It 
is a fashion with some people to think that this

'King’s career was cut short; but I must say myself 
that I think he ran a pretty long one. 

William Laud, Archbishop ofCanterbury , was 
the King’s right-hand man in the religious part of 
the putting down of the people’s liberties. Land, 
who was a sincere man of large learning but small 
sense — for the two things sometimes go together 
in vary different quantities — though a Protestant 
held opinions so near those of the Catholics, that 
the Pope wanted to make a Cardinal of him, if he 
would have accepted that favor. He looked upon 
vows, robes, lighted candles, images, and so forth, 
as amazingly important in religious ceremonies; 
and he brought in an immensity of bowing and 
candle-snuffing. He also regarded archbishops and 
bishops as a sort of miraculous persons, and was 
inveterate in the last degree against any who thought 
otherwise. Accordingly, he offered up thanks to 
Heaven, and was in a state of much pious pleasure, 
when a Scotch clergyman named Leighton, was 
pilloried, whipped, branded in the cheek, and had 
one of his ears cut off, and one of his nostrils sht, 
for calling bishops trumpery and the inventions of 
men. He originated on a Sunday morning the pro - 
secution of William Prynne; a barrister, who was 
of similar opinions, and who was fined a thousand 
pounds, who was pilloried, who had his ears cnt 
off on two occasions — one ear at a time — * ^ 
who was imprisoned for life. He highly approved 
of the punishment of Doctor Bast wick, a physi- 
cian, who was also fined a thousand pounds, and 
who afterwards had kis ears cut off, and was im-

prisoned for life. These were gentle methods of 
persuasion, some will tell yon: still, I thmlr they 
were rather calculated to be alarming to the people. 

In the money part of the putting down of the 
people's liberties , the King was equally gentle, as 
some will tell you: still, as I think, equally alarm- 
ing. He levied those duties of tonnage and poun- 
dage, and increased them as he thought fit He 
(panted monopolies to companies of merchants on 
their paying him for them , notwithstanding the great 
complaints that had, for years and years, been 
made on the subjects of monopolies. He fined the 
people for disobeying proclamations issued by his 
Sowship in direct violation of the law. He revived 
the detested Forest laws, and took private pro- 
perty to himself as his forest right. Above all, 
determined to have what was called Ship Money, 
that is to say, money for the support of the fleet 
— not only from the sea-ports , but from all the 
counties of England} having found out that, in 
some ancient time or other, all the counties paid 
it The grievance of this ship money being some- 
what too strong, John Chambers, a citizen of Lon- 
don, refused to pay his part of it For this the 
Lord Mayor ordered John Chambers to prison, and 
for that John Chambers brought a suit against the 
Lord Mayor. Lord Sat, also, behaved like a real 
aoWeman, and declared he would not pay. But, 
the sturdiest and best opponent of the ship money 
was John Hampden, a. gentleman of Buckingham- 
shire, who had sat among the vipers in the House 
of Commons when there was such a thing, and

who had been the bosom friend of Sir John Eliot 
This case was tried before the twelve judges in the 
Court of Exchequer; and again the King's lawyers 
said it was impossible that ship money could be 
wrong, because the King could do no wrong, how- 
ever hard he tried — and he really did try very 
hard during these twelve years. Seven of the 
judges said that was quite true, and Hr. Hampden 
was bound to pay; five of the judges said that was 
quite false, and Mr. Hampden was not bound to 
pay* So the King triumphed (as he thought), by 
making Hampden the most popular man in Eng- 
land, where matters were getting to that height 
now that many honest Englishmen could not en- 
dure their country, and sailed away across the seas, 
to found a colony in Massachusetts Bay in America. 
It is said that Hampden himself and his relation 
Oliver Cromwell, were going with a company of 
such voyagers, and were actually on board ship, 
when they were stopped by a proclamation, pro- 
hibiting sea captains to carry out such passengers 
without the royal license. But O! it would hare 
been well for the King if he had let them go! 

This was the state of England. If Laud had 
been a madman just broke loose, he could not have 
done more mischief than he did in Scotland, br 
his endeavours (in which he was seconded by the 
King, then in person in that part of his dominions) 
to force his own ideas of bishops, and his own re- 
ligious forms and ceremonies , upon the Scotch, he 
roused that nation to a perfect frenzy. They f oxsor 
ed a solemn league, which they called The Core-

nant, for the preservation of their own religious 
forms; they rose in arms throughout the whole 
country; they summoned all their men to prayers 
and sermons twice-a-day by beat of drum; they 
sang psalms , in which they compared their enemies 
to all the evil spirits that ever were heard of; and 
they solemnly vowed to smite them with the sword. 
At first the King tried force, then treaty, then a 
Scottish Parliament, which did not answer at all. 
Then he tried the Karl of Strafford, formerly 
Sir Thomas Wentworth, who, as Lord Went- 
worth, had been governing Ireland. He, too, had 
carried it with a very high hand there, though, it 
must be frankly admitted, to the benefit and pros- 
perity of that country. 

Strafford and Laud were, of course, for con- 
quering the Scottish people by force of arms. Other 
lords who were taken into council, recommended 
that a Parliament should at last be called; to which 
the King unwillingly consented. So , on the thir- 
teenth of April, one thousand six hundred and 
forty, that then strange Wight, a Parliament, was 
seen at Westminster. It is called the Short Parlia- 
ment, for it lasted a very little while. While the 
members were all looking at one another, doubtful 
who would dare to speak, Mr. Pym arose and set 
forth all that the King had done unlawfully during 
the past twelve yearn, and what was the position 
to which England was then reduced. This great 
example set, other members took courage and spoke 
the truth freely, though with great patience and 
moderation. The King, a little frightened, sent to

say that if they would grant him a certain sum on 
certain terms , no more ship money should be raised. 
They debated the matter for two days; and then, 
as they would not give him all he asked without 
promise or enquiry, he dissolved them. 

But they knew very well that he must have a 
Parliament now; and he began to make that dis- 
covery too, though rather late in the day. Where- 
fore, on the twenty-fourth of September, being 
then at York with an army collected against the 
Scottish people, but sullen and discontented like 
the rest of the nation, the King told a great council 
of the Lords, whom he had called to meet him 
there, that he would summon another Parliament 
to assemble on the third of November. The soldiers 
of the Covenant had now forced their way into 
England and taken possession of the northern coun- 
ties, where the coals are got: so, as it would never 
do to be without coals, and as the King’s troops 
could make no head against the Covenanters so 
full of gloomy zeal, a truce was made, and a treaty 
with Scotland was taken into consideration. Mean- 
while the northern counties paid the Covenanters 
to leave the eoals alone, and keep quiet. 

We have now disposed of the Short Parliament. 
We have next to see what memorable things were 
done by the Long one. j

CHAPTER XXXVII 

ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST. 

The Long Parliament assembled on the third 
of November , one thousand six hundred and forty- 
one. That day week the Earl of Strafford arrived 
from York, very sensible that the spirited and de- 
termined men who formed that Parliament were no 
friends towards him, who had not only deserted 
flie cause of the people, but who had, on all oc- 
casions, opposed himself to their liberties. The 
King told him, for his comfort, that the parlia- 
ment u should not hurt one hair of his head.” But, 
on the very next day Mr. Pym, in the House of 
Commons, and with great solemnity, impeached the 
Earl of Strafford as a traitor. He was immediately 
taken into custody and fell from his proud height 
in a moment 

It was the twenty-second of March before he 
was brought to trial in Westminster Hall, where, 
although he was very ill and suffered great pain, 
he defended himself with such ability and majesty, 
that it was doubtful whether he would not get the 
best of it after all. But on the thirteenth day of 
the trial , Pym produced in the House of Commons 
a copy of some notes of a council, found by young 
Sr HaRBy Vane in a red velvet cabinet belonging 
to his father (Secretary Vane, who sat at the council 
table with the Earl), in which Strafford had dis-

tinctly told the King that he was free from all 
rules and obligations of government, and might do 
with his people whatever he liked; and in which 
he had added - — “Ton have an army in Ireland 
that you may employ to reduce this kingdom to 
obedience.” It was not clear whether by the words 
“this kin gdom,” he had really meant England or 
Scotland, but the Parliament contended that he 
meant England, and of course this was treason. 
At the same sitting of the House of Commons it 
was resolved to bring in a bill of attainder de- 
claring the treason to have been committed: in pre- 
ference to proceeding with the trial by impeach- 
ment, which would have required the treason to he 
proved. 

So a bill was brought in at once, was earned 
through the House of Commons by a large ma- 
jority, and was sent up to the House of Lords. 
While it was still uncertain whether the House of 
Lords would pass it and the King consent to it, 
Pym disclosed to the House of Commons that the 
King and Queen had both been plotting with the 
officers of the army to bring up the soldiers and 
control the Parliament, and also to introduce two 
hundred soldiers into the Tower of London, to 
effect the Earl’s escape. The plotting with the 
army was revealed by one George Goring, the 
son of a lord of that name: a bad fellow, who was 
one of the original plotters, and turned traitor. 
The Kin g had actually given his warrant for the 
admission of the two hundred men into the Toweij 
and they would have got in too but for the refosal

of the governor — a sturdy Scotchman of the name 
of Balfour — to admit them. These matters being 
made public, great numbers of people began to 
riot outside the Houses of Parliament, and to cry 
out for the execution of the Earl of Strafford, as 
one of the King’s chief instruments against them* 
The bill passed the House of Lords while the 
people were in this state of agitation , and was laid 
before the King for his assent, together with an- 
other bill, declaring that the Parliament then as- 
sembled should not be dissolved or adjourned with- 
out their own consent. The King — not unwilling 
to save a faithful servant, though he had no great 
attachment for him — was in some doubt what to 
do, but he gave his consent to both bills, although 
he in his heart believed that the bill against the 
Earl of Strafford was unlawful and unjust. The 
Earl had written to him, telling him that he was 
willing to die for his sake. But he had not ex- 
pected that his royal master would take him at his 
word quite so readily, for when he heard his doom 
be laid his hand upon his heart, and said, “Put 
not your trust in Princes!” 

The King, who never could be straight-forward 
and plain, through one single day or through one 
single sheet of paper, wrote a letter to the Lords, 
and sent it by the young Prince of Wales, en- 
treating them to prevail with the Commons that 
“that unfortunate man should fulfil the natural 
course of his life in a close imprisonment.” In a 
postscript to the very same letter, “If he must die, 
it were charity to reprieve him till Saturday.” If

there had been any doubt of big fate, this weakness 
and meanness would have settled it. The very 
next day, which was the twelfth of May, he was 
brought out to be beheaded on Tower TB . 1L 

Archbishop Laud, who had been so fond of 
having people’ s ecus cropped off and their noses 
Blit, was now confined in the Tower too; and when 
the Sari went by his window, to his death, he was 
there, at his request, to give him his bleming. 
They had been great friends in the King’s cause, 
and the Earl had written to him, in the days #f 
their power, that he thought it would be an ad- 
mirable thing to have Mr. Hampden publicly 
whipped for refusing to pay the ship money. How- 
ever, those high and mighty doings were over now, 
and the Earl went his way to death with dignity 
tad heroism. The governor wished him to. get into 
a coach at the Tower gate, for fear the people 
should tear him to pieces; but he said it was all 
one to him whether he died by the axe or by their 
hands. So, he walked, with a firm tread and a 
stately look, and sometimes pulled off his hat to 
them as he passed along. They were , profoundly 
quiet. He made a speech on the scaffold from 
some *K>tes he had prepared (the paper was found 
lying there after his head was struck off), and one 
blow of the axe killed him, in the forty-ninth year 
of his age. 

This bold and daring act, the Parliament ac- 
companied by other famous measures, all origina- 
ting (as even this did) in the King’s having fl0

of Delinquents was applied to all sheriffs and 
other officers i who had been concerned in raising 
the ship money, or any other money, from the 
people, in an unlawful manner; the Hampden 
judgment was reversed; the judges who had de* 
eided against Hampden were called upon to give 
large securities that they would take such conse- 
quences as Parliament might impose upon them; 
and one was arrested as he sat in High Court, and 
carried off to prison. Laud was impeached; the 
unfortunate victims, whose ears had been cropped 
and whose noses had been slit, were brought out 
of prison in triumph; and a bill was passed de- 
claring that a Parliament should be called every 
third year, and that if the King and the King's 
officers did not call it, the people should assemble 
of themselves and summon it, as of their own right 
and power. Great illuminations and rejoicings took 
place over all these things, and the country was 
wildly excited. That the Parliament took advan- 
tage^ of this excitement and stirred them up by 
every means, there is no doubt; but you are al- 
ways to remember those twelve long years, during 
which the King had tried so hard whether he really 
could do any wrong or not. 

All this time there was a great religious outcry 
against the rigid: of the Bishops to sit in Parlia- 
ment; to which the Scottish people particularly ob-

and, partly on this account and partly because 
they had had foolish expectations that the Parlia- 
ment would be able to take off nearly all the taxes,

numbers of them sometimes wavered and inclined 
towards the King. 

I believe myself, that if, at this or almost any 
other period of his life, the King could have been 
trusted by any man not out of his senses, he might 
have saved himself and kept his throne. But, on 
the English army being disbanded, he plotted with 
the officers again, as he had done before, and 
established the fact beyond all doubt, by putting 
his signature of approval to a petition against the 
Parliamentary leaders , which was drawn up by 
certain officers. When the Scottish army was dis- 
banded, he went to Edinburgh in four days — 
which was going very fast at that time — to plot 
again, and so darkly too, that it is difficult to de- 
cide what his whole object was. Some suppose 
that he wanted to gain over the Scottish Parlia- 
ment, as he did in fact gain over, by presents and 
favors, many Scottish lords and men of power. 
Some think that he went to get proofs against the 
Parliamentary leaders in England of their having 
treasonably invited the Scottish people to come and 
help them. With whatever object he went to Scot- 
land, he did little good by going. At the instiga* 
tion of the Earl op Montrose, a desperate man 
who was then in prison for plotting, he tried to 
kidnap three Scottish lords ,~who escaped. A com- 
mittee of the Parliament at home, who had followed 
to watch him, wrote an account of this Incident, 
as it was called, to the Parliament; the Parliament 
made a fresh stir about it; were (or feigned to be) 
much alarmed for themselves, and wrote to the

CHARLES THE FIRST. 231 

Earl of Essex, the commander-in- chief, for a 
guard to protect them. 

It is not absolutely proved that the King plotted 
in Ireland besides, but it is very probable that he 
did, and that the Queen did too; and that he had 
some wild hope of gaining the Irish people over 
to his side by favoring a rise among them. Whether 
or no, they did rise in a most brutal, savage, and 
atrocious rebellion; in which, encouraged by their 
priests, they committed such atrocities upon num- 
bers of the English, of both sexes and of all ages, 
as nobody could believe, but for their being re- 
lated, on oath, by eye-witnesses. Whether one 
hundred thousand or two hundred thousand Pra- 
testants were murdered in this outbreak, is un- 
certain; but, that it was as ruthless and barbarous 
an outbreak as ever was known among any savage 
people on earth, is absolutely certain. 

The King came home from Scotland, determined 
to make a great struggle for his lost power. He 
believed that, through his presents and favors, 
Scotland would take no part against him; and the 
Lord Mayor of London received him with such a 
magnificent dinner that he thought he must have 
become popular again in England. It would take 
a good many Lord Mayors, however, to make a 
people , and the King soon found himself mistaken. 

Not so soon, though, but that there was a great 
opposition in the Parliament to a celebrated paper 
put forth by Pym and Hampden and the rest, 
called “The Remonstrance ,” which set forth all 
the illegal acts that the Bang had ever done, but

politely laid the blame of them on his bad ad- 
visers. Even when it was passed and presented to 
him, the King still thonght himself strong enough 
to discharge Balfour from his command in the 
Tower, and to put in his place a man of bad cha- 
racter; to whom the Commons instantly objected, 
and whom he was obliged to abandon. At this 
time, the old outcry about the Bishops became 
louder than ever , and the old Archbishop of York 
was so near being murdered as he went down to 
the House of Lords — being laid hold of by the 
mob and violently knocked about, in return for 
very foolishly scolding a shrill boy who was yelp- 
ing out “No Bishops!” — that he sent for all the 
Bishops who were in town and proposed to them 
to sign a declaration that as they could no longer, 
without danger to their lives, attend their duty in 
Parliament, they protested against the lawfulness 
of everything done in their absence. This they 
asked the King to send to the House of Lords, 
which he did. Then the House of Commons im- 
peached the whole party of Bishops and sent them 
off to the Tower. 

Taking no warning from this, but encouraged 
by there being a moderate party in the Parliament 
who objected to these strong measures, the King, 
on the third of January, one thousand six hundred 
and forty-two, took the rashest step that ever was 
taken by mortal man. 

Of his own accord and without advice, he sent 
the Attorney -General to the House of Lords to 
accuse of treason certain members of Parliament,

who, as popular leaders, were the most obnoxious 
to him; Loud Kxmbolton, Sir Arthur Haselriq, 
Dehzil Hollis, John Pth (they used to call him 
King Pym, he possessed such power and looked, 
so big), John Hampden, and William Strode. The 
houses of these members he caused to be entered, 
and their papers to be sealed up. At the same 
time, he sent a messenger to the House of Com- 
mons demanding to have the five gentlemen who 
were members of that House immediately produced. 
To this the House replied that they should appear 
as soon as there was any legal charge against 
them, and immediately adjourned.. 

Next day, the House of Commons send into 
the City to let the Lord Mayor know that their 
privileges are invaded by the King, and that there 
is no safety for anybody or anything. Then , when the 
five members are gone out of the way, down comes 
the King himself, with all his guard and from two 
to three hundred gentlemen and soldiers , of whom 
the greater part were armed. These he leaves in 
the hall, and then, with his nephew at his side, 
goes into the House, takes oi? his hat, and walks 
up to the Speaker's chair. The Speaker leaves it, 
the King stands in front of it, looks about. him 
steadily for a little while, and says he has come 
for those five members. No one speaks, and then 
he calls John Pym by name. No one speaks, and 
then he calls Denzil Hollis by name. No one 
speaks , and then he asks the Speaker of the House 
where those five members are? The Speaker, an- 
swering on his knee, nobly replies that he is the

servant of that House, and that he has neither 
eyes to see, nor tongue to speak, anything 
but what the House commands him. Upon this, 
the King, beaten from that time evermore, replies 
that he will seek them himself, for they have 
committed treason; and goes out, with his hat in 
his hand, amid some audible murmurings from the 
members. 

No words can describe the hurry that arose out 
of doors when all this was known. The five mem* 
bers had gone for safety to a house in Coleman 
Street, in the City, where they were guarded all 
night; and indeed the whole city watched in arms 
like an army. At ten o’clock in the morning, the 
King, already frightened at what he had done, 
came to the Guildhall, with only half a dozen 
lords, and made a speech to the people, hoping 
that they would not shelter those whom he accused 
of treason. Next day, he issued a proclamation 
for the apprehension of the five members; but the 
Parliament minded it so little that they made great 
arrangements for having them brought down to 
Westminster in great state, five days afterwards* 
The King was so alarmed now at his own impru- 
dence, if not for his own safety, that he left his 
palace at Whitehall, and went away with his Queen 
and children to Hampton Court. 

It was the eleventh of May, when the five mem- 
bers were carried in state and triumph to West- 
minster. They were taken by water. The river 
could not be seen for the boats on it; and the five 
members were hemmed in by barges full of 111611

and great guns, ready to protect them, at any 
cost. Along the Strand a large body of the train- 
bands of London , under their commander, Skippon, 
marched to be ready to assist the little fleet. Beyond 
them, came a crowd who choked the streets, roar- 
ing incessantly about the Bishops and the Papists, 
and crying out contemptuously as they passed 
Whitehall, w What has become of the King?” With 
this great noise outside the House of Commons, 
and with great silence within, Mr. Pym rose and 
informed the House of the great kindness with 
which they had been received in the City. Upon 
that, the House called the sheriffs in and thanked 
them, and requested the train-bands, under their 
commander Skippon, to guard the House of Com- 
mons every day. Then, came four thousand men 
on horseback out of Buckinghamshire, offering their 
services as a guard too, and bearing a petition to 
the King, complaining of the injury that had been 
done to Mr. Hampden, who was their county man 
and much beloved and honored. 

When the King set off for Hampton Court, the 
gentlemen and soldiers who had been with him, 
followed him out of town as far as Kingston-upon- 
Thames, and next day Lord Digby came to them 
from the King at Hampton Court, in his coach and 
six, to inform them that the King accepted their 
protection. This, the Parliament said, was making 
war against the kingdom, and Lord Digby fled 
abroad. The Parliament then immediately applied 
themselves to getting hold of the military power of 
the country, well knowing that the King was al-

ready trying hard to use it against them, and had 
secretly sent the Earl of Newcastle to Hull, to 
secure a valuable magazine of arms and gunpowder 
that was there. In those times , every county had 
its own magazines of arms and powder, for its 
own train-bands or militia ; so, the Parliament brought 
in a bill claiming the right (which up to this time 
had belonged to the King) of appointing the Lord 
Lieutenants of counties , who commanded these train- 
bands; and, also, of having all the forts, castles, 
and garrisons in the kingdom, put into the hands 
of such governors as they, the Parliament, could 
confide in. It also passed a law depriving the Bi- 
shops of their votes. The Bang gave his assent 
to that bill, but would not abandon the right of 
appointing the Lord Lieutenants, though he said 
he was willing to appoint such as might be sug- 
gested to him by the Parliament When the Earl 
of Pembroke asked him whether he would not give 
way on that question for a time, he said, “By 
God! not for one hour!" and upon fhig he and the 
Parliament went to war. 

His young daughter was betrothed to the Prince 
of Orange. On pretence of taking her to the 
country of her future husband, the Queen was al- 
ready got safely away to Holland, there to pawn 
the Crown jewels for money to raise an army on 
the Bang's side. The Lord- Admiral being sick, 
the House of Commons now named the Earl of 
Warwick to hold his place for a year. The King 
named another gentleman; the House of Commons 
took its own way, and the Earl of Warwick b®“

came Lord Admiral without the •'Kin g** consent. 
The Parliament sent orders down to Hull to have 
that magazine removed to London; the King went 
down to Hull to take it himself. The citizens would 
not admit him into the town, and the governor 
would not admit him into the castle. The Parlia- 
ment resolved that whatever the two Houses passed, 
and the King would not consent to, should be 
called an Ordinance, and should be as much a 
law as if he did consent to it. The King protested 
against this, and gave notice that these ordinances 
were not to be obeyed. The King, attended by 
the majority of the House of Peers, and by many 
members of the House of Commons, established 
himself at York. The Chancellor went to him with 
the Great Seal, and the Parliament made a new 
Great Seal. The Queen sent over a ship full of 
arms and ammunition, and the King issued letters 
to borrow money at high interest. The Parliament 
raised twenty regiments of foot and seventy-five 
troops of horse; and the people willingly aided 
them with their money , plate , jewellery , and trinkets 

— the married women even with their wedding- 
rings. Every member of Parliament who could 
raise a troop or a regiment in his own part of the 
country, dressed it according to his taste and in 
his own colors , and commanded it. Foremost among 
them all, Oliver Cromwell raised a troop of horse 

— thoroughly in earnest and thoroughly well armed 

— who were, perhaps, the best soldiers that ever 
were seen. 

In some of their proceedings, this famous Par-

liament unquestionably passed the bounds of all 
previous law and custom, yielded to and favored 
riotous assemblages of the people, and acted ty- 
rannically in imprisoning some who differed from 
the popular leaders. But, again you are always 
to remember that the twelve years during: which 
the King had had his own wilful way, had gone 
before; and that nothing could make the times what 
they might, could, would, or should have been, if 
those twelve years had never rolled away. 


CHAPTER XXXYHI. 

ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST. 

I shall not try to relate the particulars of the 
great civil war between King Charles the First and 
the Long Parliament, which lasted nearly four 
years, and a full account of which would fill many 
large books. It was a sad thing that Englishmen 
should once more be fighting against Englishmen 
on English ground; but, it is some consolation to 
know that on both sides there was great humanity, 
forbearance, and honor. The soldiers of the Par- 
liament were far more remarkable for these good 
qualities than the soldiers of the King (many of 
whom fought for mere pay without much caring 
for the cause); but those of the nobility and gentry 
who were on the King’s side were so brave, and 
so faithful to him, that their conduct cannot bat 
command our highest admiration. Among these

were great numbers of Catholics, who took the 
royal side because the Queen was so strongly of 
their persuasion. 

The Kang might have distinguished some of 
these gallant spirits, if he had been as generous a 
spirit himself, by giving them the command of his 
army. Instead of that, however, true to his old 
high notions of royalty, he entrusted it to his two 
nephews, Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice, 
who were of royal blood, and came over from 
abroad to help him. It might have been better for 
him if they had stayed away, since Prince Rupert 
was an impetuous hot-headed fellow, whose only 
idea was to dash into battle at all times and sea- 
sons, and lay about him. 

The general-in-chief of the Parliamentary army 
was the Earl of Essex, a gentleman of honor and 
an excellent soldier. A little while before the war 
broke out, there had been some rioting at West- 
minster between certain officious law students and 
noisy soldiers, and the shop-keepers and their ap- 
prentices, and the general people in the streets. 
At that time the King’s friends called the crowd, 
Roundheads, because the apprentices wore short 
hair; the crowd, in return, called their opponents 
Cavaliers , meaning that they were a blustering set, 
who pretended to be very military. These two 
words now began to be used to distinguish the 
two sides in the civil war. The Royalists also 
called the Parliamentary men Rebels and Rogues, 
while the Parliamentary men called them Malignants,

and spoke of themselves as the Godly, the Honest, 
and so forth. 

The war broke out at Portsmouth, where that 
double traitor Goring had again gone over to the 
Xing and was besieged by the Parliamentary troops. 
Upon this , the King proclaimed the Earl of Essex 
and the officers serving under him, traitors, and 
called upon his loyal subjects to meet him in arms 
at Nottingham on the twenty-fifth of August. But 
his loyal subjects came about him in scanty num- 
bers, and it was a windy gloomy day, and the 
Royal Standard got blown down, and the whole 
affair was very melancholy. The chief engage- 
ments after this , took place in the vale of the Bed 
Horse near Banbury, in Wiltshire, at Brentford, 
at Devizes , at Chalgrave Field (where Mr. Hampden 
was so sorely wounded while fighting at the head 
of hii men, that he died within .a week), at Tewkes- 
bury (in which battle Lord Falkland, one of the 
best noblemen on tbe King’s side, was killed), &t 
Leicester, at Naseby, at Winchester, at Marston 
Moor near York, at Newcastle, and in many other 
parts of England and Scotland. These battles were 
attended with various successes. At one time the 
King was victorious.; at another time the Parlia- 
ment. But almost all tbe great and busy towns 
were against the King; and when it was considered 
necessary to fortify London, all ranks of P eo P* e ’ 
from labouring men and women up to lords and 
ladies, worked hard together with heartiness end 
good-will. The most distinguished leaders on the 
Parliamentary side were Hampden , Sir Thomas

Tajkfax, and, above all, Oliver Cromwell, and 
bis son-in-law Iretox. 

During the whole of this war, the people, to 
whom it was very expensive* and irksome,* and to 
whom it was made the more -distressing by almost 
every family bring divided — some of its mem- 
bers attaching themselves to the one side and some 
to the other — were over and over again most 
anxious for peace. So were some of the best men 
hi each cause. Accordingly, treaties of peace were 
focussed between commissioners from the Parlia- 
ment and the King; at York, at Oxford (where the 
King held a little Parliament of his own) , and at 
Oxbridge. But they came to nothing. In all these 
ftegociations , and in all his difficulties, the King 
showed himself at his best. He was courageous, 
Cool, self-possessed and clever; but, the old taint 
of his character was always in him, and he was 
never for one single moment to be trusted. Lord 
Clarendon, the historian, one of his highest ad- 
mirers, supposes that he had unhappily promised* 
the Queen never to make peaee without her eon- 
sent, and that this must often be taken as his ex- 
cuse. He never kept his word from night to morn- 
ing. He signed a cessation of hostilities with the 
blood-stained Irish rebels for a sum of money, and 
invited the Irish regiments over, to help him against 
the Parliament. In the battle of Naseby, his ca- 
binet was seized and was found to contain a cor- 
respondence with the Queen , in which he expressly 
told her that he had deceived the Parliament — a 
mongrel Parliament, he called it now, as an im-

provement on his old term of vipers — in pretend- 
ing to recognize it and to treat with it; and from 
which it further appeared that he had been long in 
secret treaty with the Duke of Lorraine for a fo- 
reign army of ten thousand men. Disappointed in 
this, he sent a most devoted friend of his, the Earl 
of Glamorgan, to Ireland, to conclude a secret 
treaty with the Catholic powers, to send him an 
Irish army of ten thousand men; in return for 
which he was to bestow great favors on the Ca- 
tholic religion. And when this treaty was dis- 
covered in the carriage of a fighting Irish Arch- 
bishop , who was killed in one of the many skir- 
mishes of those days, he basely denied and de- 
serted his attached friend, the Earl, on his being , 
charged with high treason; and — even worse than | 
this — had left blanks in the secret instructions he 
gave him with his own kingly hand, expressly that 
he might thus save himself. 

At last, on the twenty -seventh day of April, 
one thousand six hundred and forty-six, the King 
found himself in the city of Oxford, so surrounded 
by the Parliamentary army who were dosing in 
upon him on all Bides, that he felt that if he would 
escape, he must delay no longer. So, that night, 
having altered the cut of his hair and beard, he 
was dressed up as a servant and put upon a horse 
with a cloak strapped behind him, and rpde out of 
the town behind one of his own faithful followers, 
with a clergyman of that country, who knew the 
road well, for a guide. He rode towards London , 
as far as Harrow, and then altered his plans, and I

resolved , it would seem, to go to the Scottish camp* 
The Scottish men had been invited over to help 
the Parliamentary army, and had a large force 
then in England. The King was so desperately 
intriguing in everything he did, that it is doubtful 
what he exactly meant by this step. He took it, 
anyhow r and delivered himself up to the Earl of 
Leven, the Scottish general-in-chief, who treated 
Mm as an honorable prisoner. Negotiations be- 
tween the Parliament on the one hand and the 
Scottish authorities on the other, as to what should 
he done with him, lasted until the following Fe- 
bruary. Then, when the King had refused to the 
Parliament the concession of that old militia point 
for twenty years, mid had refused to Scotland the 
recognition of its Solemn League and Covenant, 
Scotland got a handsome sum for its army and its 
help, and the King into the bargain. He was taken 
by certain Parliamentary commissioners appointed 
to receive him, to one of his own houses, called 
Holmby House, near Althorpe, in Northampton- 
shire. • 

While the Civil War was still in progress John 
Pym died, and was buried with great honor in 
Westminster Abbey — not with greater honor than 
he deserved, for the liberties of Englishmen owe a 
mighty debt to Pym and Hampden. The war was 
hut newly over when the Earl of Essex died, of 
on illness brought on by his having overheated 
himself in a stag hunt in Windsor Forest. He, too. 
Was buried in Westminster Abbey, with great state.

bishop Laud died upon the scaffold when the war 
was not yet done. His trial lasted in all nearly a 
year, and, it being doubtful even then whether the 
charges brought against him amounted to treason, 
the odious old contrivance of the worst kings was 
resorted to, and a bill of attainder was brought in 
against him. He was a violently prejudiced and 
mischievous person, had had strong ear-cropping 
and nose-slitting propensities, as you know, and 
had done a world of harm. But he died peaceably, 
and like a brave old man. 


CHAPTER XXXIX. 

ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST. 

When the Parliament had got the King into 
their hands, they became very anxious to get rid 
of their army, in which Oliver Cromwell had begun 
to acquire great power; not only because of his 
courage and high abilities , but because he professed 
to be very sincere in the Scottish sort of Puritau 
religion that was then exceedingly popular among 
the soldiers. They were as much opposed to the 
Bishops as to the Pope himself; and the very pri* 
vates, drummers, and trumpeters , had such an is* 
convenient habit of starting np and preaching long' 
winded discourses , that I would not have belong^ 
to that army on any account. 

So, the Parliament being far from sure but that 
the army might begin to preach and fight against

them now it had nothing else to do, proposed to 
disband the greater part of it, to send another part 
to serve in Ireland against the rebels, and to keep 
only a small force in England. But, the army 
would not consent to be broken up, except upon 
its own conditions; and when the Parliament showed 
an intention of compelling it, it acted for itself in 
an unexpected manner. A certain comet, of the 
name of Joicb, arrived at Holmby House one night, 
attended by four hundred horsemen , went into the 
King's room with his hat in one hand and a pistol 
in the other, and told the King that he had come 
to take him away. The King, was willing enough 
to go, and only stipulated that he should be pub* 
lidy required to do so next morning. Next morn- 
ing, accordingly, he appeared on the top of the 
steps of thie house, and asked Comet Joice before 
bis men and the guard set there by the Parliament, 
what authority he had for taking him away? To 
this Comet Joice replied, u the authority of the 
army.” “Have you a written commission?” said 
the King. Joice, pointing to his four hundred men 
on horseback, replied, “that is my commission.” 
“Well,” said the King smiling, as if he were 
pleased, “I never before read such a commission; 
but it is written in fair and legible characters. This 
is a company of as handsome proper gentlemen as 
I have seen a long while.” He was asked where 
he would like to live, and he said at Newmarket. 
So, to Newmarket he, and Comet Joice, and the 
four hundred horsemen, rode; the King remarking,

246 a child’s history op England. 

in the same smiling way, that he could ride as faf 
at a spell as Comet Joice, or any man there. 

The King quite believed, I think, that the army 
were his friends. He said as much to Fairfax when 
that general, Oliver Cromwell, and Ireton, went to 
persuade him to return to the custody of the Parlia- 
ment He preferred to remain as he was, and re- 
solved to remain as he was. And when the army 
moved nearer and nearer London to frighten the 
Parliament into yielding to their demands, they 
took the King with them. It was a deplorable thing 
that England should be at the mercy of a great 
body of soldiers with arms in their hands , but the 
King certainly favored them at this important time 
of his life in reference to the more lawful power 
that tried to control him. It must be added, how- 
ever, that they treated him, as yet, more respect- 
fully and kindly than the Parliament had ever done. 
They allowed him to be attended by his own ser 
vants , to be splendidly entertained at various houses, 
and to see his children — at Cavesham House, 
near Beading — for two days. Whereas , the Par* 
liament had been rather hard with him, and had 
only allowed him to ride out and play at bowls. 

It is much to be believed that if the Bang could 
have been trusted, even at this time, he might have 
been saved. Even Oliver Cromwell expressly said 
that he did believe that no man could enjoy his 
possessions in peace, unless the Bang had his 
rights. He was not unfriendly towards the King; 
he had been present when he received his children, 
and had been much affected by the pitiable nature

of the scenes he saw the King often; he frequently 
walked and talked with him in the long galleries 
and pleasant gardens of the Palace at Hampton 
Court, whither he was now removed; and in all 
this risked something of his influence with the army. 
But, the King was in secret hopes of help from 
the Scottish people; and the moment he was en- 
couraged to join them he began to be cool to his 
new friends, the army, and to tell the officers that 
they could not possibly do without him. At the 
very time, too, when he was promising to make 
Cromwell and Ireton noblemen, if they woul4 help 
him up to his old height, he was writing to the 
Queen that he meant to hang them. They both 
afterwards declared that they had been privately 
informed that such a letter would be found, on a 
certain evening, sewn up in a saddle, which would 
be taken to the Blue Boar in Holbom to be sent 
to Dover; and that they went there, disguised as 
common soldiers, and sat drinking in the inn-yard 
until a man came with the saddle, which they 
ripped up with their knives , and therein found the 
letter. I see little reason to doubt the story. It is 
certain that Oliver Cromwell told one of the King’s 
most faithful followers that the King could not be 
trusted, and that he would not be answerable if 
anything amiss were to happen to him. Still, even 
after that, he kept a promise he had made to the 
King, by letting him know that there was a plot 
with a certain portion of the army to seize him. 
I believe that, in fact, he sincerely wanted the 
King to escape abroad, and so to be got rid of

without more trouble or danger. That Oliver him- 
self had work enough with the army is pretty 
plain | for some of the troops were so mutinous 
against him, and against those who acted with, him 
at this time, that he found it necessary to have 
one man shot at the head of his regiment to over- 
awe the rest. 

The King, when he received Oliver’s warning, 
made his escape from Hampton Court, and, after 
some indecision and uncertainty, went to Caris- 
brooke Castle in the Isle of Wight. At first, he 
was pretty free there; but, even there, he carried 
on a pretended treaty with the Parliament, while 
he was really treating with commissioners from 
Scotland to send an army into England to take his 
part. When he broke off this treaty with the Par- 
liament (having settled with Scotland) and was 
treated as a prisoner, his treatment was not changed 
too soon, for he had plotted to escape that very 
night to a ship sent by the Queen, which was lyi ng 
off the island. 

He was doomed to be disappointed in his hopes 
from Scotland. The agreement he had made with 
the Scottish Commissioners was not favourable enough 
to the religion of that country, to please the Scot- 
tish clergy, and they preached against it. The 
consequence was , that the army raised in Scotland 
and sent over, was too small to do much; and that, 
although it was helped by a rising of the Boyaliste 
in England and by good soldiers from Ireland, it 
could make no head against the Parliamentary army 
under such men as Cromwell and Fairfax. The

King’s eldest son, the Prince of "Wales, came over 
from Holland with nineteen ships (a part of the 
English fleet having gone over to him) to help hi* 
father, but nothing came of his voyage, and he 
was fain to return. The most remarkable event of 
this second civil war was the cruel execution by 
the Parliamentary General, of Sir Charles Lucas 
sad Sir George Lisle, two gallant Koyalist ge- 
nerals, who had bravely defended Colchester under 
every disadvantage of famine and distress for nearly 
three months. When Sir Charles Lucas was shot. 
Sir George Lisle kissed his body, and said to the 
soldiers who were to shoot him, “Come nearer, and 
make sure of me.” “I warrant you, Sir George,” 
said one of the soldiers, “we shall hit you.” “Aye?” 
he returned with a smile , “ but I have been nearer 
to you, my friends, many a time, and you have 
missed me.” 

The Parliament, after being fearfully bullied 
by the army, who demanded to have seven mem- 
bers whom they disliked given up to them , had 
voted that they would have nothing more to do 
with the King; on the conclusion, however, of this- 
second civil war (which did not last more than six 
months) they appointed commissioners to treat with 
bim. The King, then so far released again as to 
be allowed to live in a private house at Newport 
ia the Isle of Wight, managed his own part of the 
negotiation with a sense that was admired by all 
who saw him, and gave up, in the end, all that 
was asked of him — even yielding (which he had 
steadily refused, so far) to the temporary abolition

of the bishops and the transfer of their church land 
to the Crown. Still, with his old fatal vice upon 
him, when his best friends joined the commissioners 
in beseeching him to yield all those points as the 
only means of saving himself from the army, he 
was plotting to escape from the island; he was 
holding correspondence with his friends and the 
Catholics in Ireland, though declaring that he was 
not; and he was writing with his own hand that in 
what he yielded, he meant nothing but to get time 
to escape. 

Matters were at this pass when the army, re- 
solved to defy the Parliament, marched up to Lon- 
don. The Parliament, not afraid of them now, 
and boldly led by Hollis, voted that the King’s 
concessions were sufficient ground for settling- the 
peace of the kingdom. Upon that, Colonel Bich 
and Colonel Pride went down to the House of 
C/ommons with a regiment of horse soldiers and a 
regiment of, foot; and Colonel Pride, standing in 
the lobby with a list of the members who were ob- 
noxious to the army in his hand, had them pointed 
out to him as they came through, and took them 
all into custody. This proceeding was afterwards 
called by the people, for a joke, Pride’s Purge. 
Cromwell was in the North, at the head of his 
men, at the time, but when he came home, ap- 
proved of what had been done. 

What with imprisoning some members and cau- 
sing others to stay away, the army had now re- 
duced the House of Commons to some fifty or SOt 
These soon voted that it was treason in a king to

make war against his parliament and his people, 
and sent an ordinance up to the House of Lords 
for the King’s being tried as a traitor. The House 
of Lords then sixteen in number, to a man rejected 
it. Thereupon, the Commons made an ordinance 
of their own , that they were the supreme govern- 
ment of the country, and would bring the King to 
trial. 

The King had been taken for security to a 
place called Hurst Castle: a lonely house on a 
rock in the sea, connected with the coast of Hamp- 
shire by a rough road two miles long at low water. 
Thence he was ordered to be removed to Windsor; 
thence, after being but rudely used there, and 
having none but soldiers to wait upon him at table, 
he was brought up to St. James’s Palace in Lon- 
don, and told that his trial was appointed for next 
day 

On Saturday, the twentieth of January, one 
thousand six hundred and forty-nine, this memo* 
rable trial began. The House of Commons had 
settled that one hundred and thirty -five persons 
should form the Court, and these were taken from 
the House itself, from among the officers of the 
a nny, and from among the lawyers and citizens. 
John Braes haw, serjeant-at-law, was appointed 
president. The place was Westminster Hall. At 
the upper-end, in a red velvet chair, sat the pre- 
sident, with his hat (lined with plates of iron for 
ids protection) on his head. The rest of the Court 
sat on side benches, also wearing their hats. The

King’s seat was covered with velvet, like" that of 
the president, and was opposite to it. He waa 
brought from St. James’s to Whitehall, and from 
Whitehall he came by water, to his trial. 

When he came in, he looked round very steadily 
on the Court, and on the great number of specta- 
tors, and then sat down: presently he got up and 
looked round again. On the indictment “against 
Charles Stuart, for high treason,” being read, lie 
smiled several times, and he denied the authority 
of the Court, saying that there could be no parlia- 
ment without a House of Lords , and that he saw 
no House of Lords there. Also that the King ought j 
to be there, and that he saw no King in the King’s 
right place. Bradshaw replied, that the Court was 
satisfied with its authority and that its authority 
was God’s authority and the kingdom’s. He then 
adjourned the Court to the following Monday. On 
that day, the trial was resumed, and went on all 
the week. When the Saturday came, as the King 
passed forward to his place in the Hall, some 
soldiers and others cried for “justice!” and execu- 
tion on him. That day, too, Bradshaw, like an 
angry Sultan, wore a red robe, instead of the black 
one he had worn before. The King was sentenced 
to death that day. As he went out, one solitary 
soldier said, “God bless you, Sir I” For this, his 
officer struck him. The King said he thought the 
punishment exceeded the offence. The silver head 
of his walking-stick had fallen off while he leaned 
upon it, at one time of the trial. The accident 
seemed to disturb him, as if he thought it ominous

of flie falling of bis own head; and he admitted as 
much new it was all over. 

Being taken back to Whitehall he sent to the 
House of Commons, saying that as the time of his 
execution might be nigh, he wished he might be 
allowed to see his darling children. It was granted. 
On the Monday he was taken back to St James's, 
and his two children then in England, the Prin- 
cess Elizabeth thirteen years old, and the Duxx 
o? -Gloucester nine years old, were brought to 
take leave of him, from Sion House, near Brent* 
ford. It was a sad and touching scene, when he 
kissed and fondled these poor children, and made 
a little present of two diamond seals to the Prin- 
cess, and gave them tender messages to their mother, 
(who little deserved them, for she had a lover of 
her own whom she married soon afterwards) and 
told them that he died “for the laws and liberties 
of the land.” I am bound to say that I don’t think 
he did, but I dare say he believed so. 

There were ambassadors from Holland, that 
tay, to intercede for the unhappy King, whom you 
a nd I both wish the Parliament had spared; but 
they got no answer. The Scottish Commissioners 
interceded too; so did the Prince of Wales, by a 
letter in wbieh he offered as the next heir to the 
throne, to accept any conditions from the Parlia- 
ment; so did the Queen by letter likewise. Not- 
withstanding all, the warrant for the execution was 
this day signed. There is a story that as Oliver 
Cromwell went to the table with the pen in his 
hand to put his signature to it, he drew his pen

across the face of one of the commissioners who 
was standing near, and marked it with the ink. 
That commissioner had not signed his own name 
yet , and the story adds , that when he came to do 
it, he marked Cromwell’s face with ink in the 
same way. 

The King slept well, untroubled by the know- 
ledge that it was his hist night on earth, and rose 
on the thirtieth of January, two hours before day, 
and dressed himself carefully. He put on two 
shirts lest he should tremble with the cold, and had 
his hair very carefully combed. The warrant had 
been directed to three officers of the army, Co- 
lonel Hacker, Colonel Hunks, and Colonel 
Phayek. At ten o’clock, the first of these came 
to the door and said it was time to go to White- 
hall. The King, who had always been a quick j 
walker, walked at his usual speed through the 
Park, and called out to the guard, with his ac- 
customed voice of command, “March on apace!” 
When he came to Whitehall, he was taklft to his 
own bedroom, where a breakfast was set forth. As 
he had taken the Sacrament, he would eat nothing 
more, but at about the time when the church bells 
struck twelve at noon (for he had to wait, through 
the scaffold not being ready) he took the advice of 
the good Bishop Juxon who was with him, and 
eat a little bread, and drank a glass of claret. 
Soon after he had taken this refreshment, Colonel 
Hacker came to the chamber with the warrant in 
his hand, and called for Charles Stuart. 

And then, through the long gallery of White*

hall Palace, which he had often seen light and gay 
and merry and crowded, in very different times, 
the fallen King passed along, until he came to the 
centre window of the Banquetting House, through 
which he emerged upon the scaffold, which was 
hung with black. He looked at the two execu- 
tioners who were dressed in black and masked; 
he looked at the troops of soldiers on horseback 
tod on foot, who all looked up at him in silence; 
he looked at the vast array of spectators, filling 
up the view beyond, and turning all their faces 
upon him; he looked at his old Palace of St. 
James’s; and he looked at the block. He seemed 
a little troubled to find that it was so low, and 
asked “if there were no place higher?” Then, to 
those upon the scaffold, he said “that it was the 
Parliament who had begun the war, and not he; 
hut he hoped they might be guiltless too, as ill in- 
struments had gone between them. In one respect, n 
he said, “he suffered justly, and that was because 
he had permitted an unjust sentence to be execu- 
ted on another.” In this he referred to the Earl of 
Strafford. 

He was not at all afraid to die; but he was 
toxkms to die easily. When some one touched 
the axe while he was speaking, he broke off and 
called out, “Take heed of the axe! take heed of 
the axe!” He also said to Colonel Hacker, “Take 
care that they do not put me to pain.” He told 
the executioner, “I shall say but very short prayers, 
tod then thrust out my hands” — as the sign to 
strike.

He put his hair up, under a white satin cap 
which the bishop had carried, and said, “I have a 
good cause and a gracious God on my side.” The 
bishop told him that he had but one stage more to 
travel in this weary world, and that though it was 
a turbulent and troublesome stage, it was a short 
one, and would carry him a great way — all the 
way from earth to Heaven. The King's last word, 
as he gave his cloak and the George — the de* 
coration from his breast — to the bishop , was this, 
“Remember!” He then kneeled down, laid his 
head upon the block, spread out his hands, and 
was instantly killed. One universal groan broke 
from the crowd; and the soldiers, who had sat on 
their horses and stood in their ranks immovable as 
statues, were of a sudden all in motion, clearing 
the streets. 

Thus in the forty-ninth year of his age, falling 
at the same time of his career as Strafford had 
fallen in his, perished Charles the First. With all 
my sorrow for him , I cannot agree with him that 
he died “the Martyr of the people;” for the people 
had been martyrs to him and his ideas of a King's 
rights, long before. Indeed I am afraid that he 
was but a bad judge of martyrs; for he had called 
that infamous Duke of Buckingham “the Martyr 
of his Sovereign.”

CHAPTER XL. 

ENGLAND A REPUBLIC. 

Before sunset on the memorable day on which 
King Charles the First was executed, the House of 
Commons passed an act declaring it treason in any 
one to proclaim the Prince of Wales — or any- 
body else — King of England. Soon afterwards, 
it declared that the House of Lords was useless 
and dangerous, and ought to be abolished, and 
directed that the late King’s statue should be taken 
down from the Royal Exchange in the city and 
other public places. Having laid hold of some 
famous Royalists who had escaped from prison, 
and having beheaded the Duke of Hamilton, Lord 
Holland, and Lord Capel, in Palace Yard (all 
of whom died very courageously), they then ap- 
pointed a Council of State to govern the country. 
It consisted of forty-one members, of whom five 
were peers. Bradshaw was made president. The 
House of Commons also re-admitted members who 
had opposed the King’s death, and made up its 
numbers to about a hundred and fifty. 

But, it still had an army of more than forty 
thousand men to deal with, and a very hard task 
it was to manage them. Before the King’s execu- 
tion, the army had appointed some of its officers 
to remonstrate between them and the Parliament; 
and now the common soldiers began to take that

office upon themselves. The regiments under orders 
for Ireland mutinied: one troop of horse in the city 
of London seized their own flag, and refused to 
obey orders. For this, the ringleader was shot: 
which did not mend the matter, for, both his com- 
rades and the people made a public funeral for 
him, and accompanied the body to the grave with 
sound of trumpets and with a gloomy procession of 
persons carrying bundles of rosemary steeped in 
blood. Oliver was the only man to deal with such 
difficulties as these, and he soon cut them short by 
bursting at midnight into the town of Burford, near 
Salisbury, where the mutineers were sheltered, taking 
four hundred of them prisoners , and shooting a 
number of them by sentence of court-martial. The 
soldiers soon found, as all men did, that Oliver 
was not a man to be trifled with. And there was 
an end of the mutiny. 

The Scottish Parliament did not know Oliver 
yet; so, on hearing of the King’s execution, it pro- 
claimed the Prince of Wales King Charles the Se- 
cond, on condition of his respecting the Solemn 
League and Covenant. Charles was abroad x at that 
time, and so was Montrose, from whose help he 
had hopes enough to keep him holding on and off 
with commissioners from Scotland, just as his father 
might have done. These hopes, however, were 
soon at an end, for, Montrose, having raised a few 
hundred exiles in Germany, and landed with them 
in Scotland, found that the people there, instead 
of joining him, deserted the country at his ap- 
proach. He was soon taken prisoner and earned

to Edinburgh. There he was received with every 
possible insult, and carried to prison in a cart, his 
officers going two and two before him. He was 
sentenced by the Parliament to be hanged on a 
gallows thirty feet high, to have his head set on a 
spike in Edinburgh, and his limbs distributed in 
other places , according to the old barbarous manner. 
He said he had always acted under the Royal 
orders, and only wished he had limbs enough to 
be distributed through Christendom, that it might 
be the more widely known how loyal he had been. 
He went to the scaffold in a bright and brilliant 
dress , and made a bold end at thirty-eight years 
of age. The breath was scarcely out of his body 
when Charles abandoned his memory, and denied 
that he had ever given him orders to rise in his 
behalf. Oh, the family failing was strong in that 
Charles then! 

Oliver had been appointed by the Parliament 
to command the army in Ireland, where he took a 
terrible vengeance for the sanguinary rebellion, 
and made tremendous havoc, particularly in the 
siege of Drogheda, where no quarter was given, 
and where he found at least a thousand of the in- 
habitants shut up together in the great church: 
every one of whom was killed by his soldiers, 
usually known as Oliver’s Ironsides. There were 
numbers of friars and priests among them, and 
Oliver gruffly wrote home in his despatch that these 
were “ knocked on the head” like the rest 

But, Charles having got over to Scotland, where 
the men of the Solemn League and Covenant led

him a prodigiously dull fife, and made him very 
weary with long sermons and grim Sundays, the 
Parliament called the redoubtable Oliver home to j 
knock the Scottish men on the head for setting up 
that Prince. Oliver left his son-in-law, Ireton, as 
general in Ireland in his stead (he died there after- 
wards) , and he imitated the example of his father- 
in-law with such good-will that he brought the 
country to subjection, and laid it at the feet of the 
Parliament. In the end, they passed an act for 
the settlement of Ireland, generally pardoning all 
the common people, but exempting horn this grace 
such of the wealthier sort as had been concerned 
in the rebellion, or in any killing of Protestants, 
or who refused to lay down their arms. Great 
numbers of Irish were got out of the country to 
serve under Catholic powers abroad, and a quantity 
of land was declared to have been forfeited by 
past offences, and was given to people who had 
lent money to the Parliament early in the war. 
These were sweeping measures; but, if Oliver Crom- 
well had had his own way fully, and had stayed 
in Ireland, he would have done more yet. 

However , as I have said , the Parliament wanted 
Oliver for Scotland; so, home Oliver came, and 
was made Commander of all the Forces of the 
Commonwealth of England, and in three days away 
he went with sixteen thousand soldiers to fight the 
Scottish men. Now, the Scottish men, being then 
— as you will generally find them now — mighty 
cautious, reflected that the troops they had were 
not used to war like the Ironsides, and would he

beaten in an open fight Therefore they said, “If 
we lie quiet in our trenches in Edinburgh here, 
and if all the farmers come into the town and de- 
sert the country, the Ironsides will be driven out 
by iron hunger and be forced to go away.” This 
was, no doubt, the wisest plan; but as the Scottish 
clergy would interfere with what they knew nothing 
about, and would perpetually preach long sermons, 
exhorting the soldiers to come out and fight, the 
soldiers got it in their heads that they absolutely 
must come out and fight. Accordingly, in an evil 
hour for themselves, they came out of their safe 
position. Oliver fell upon them instantly, and killed 
three thousand , and took ten thousand prisoners. 

To gratify the Scottish Parliament, and pre- 
serve their favor, Charles had signed a declaration 
they laid before him, reproaching the memory of 
his father and mother, and representing himself as 
a most religious Prince, to whom the Solemn League 
and Covenant was as dear as life. He meant no 
sort of truth in this , and soon afterwards galloped 
away on horseback to join some tiresome Highland 
friends, who were always flourishing dirks and 
broadswords. He was overtaken and induced to 
return; but this attempt, which was called “The 
start,” did him just so much service that they did 
not preach quite such long sermons at him after- 
wards as they had done before. 

On the first of January, one thousand six hun- 
dred and fifty -one, the Scottish people crowned 
him at Scone. He immediately took the chief com- 
mand of an army of twenty thousand men, and

marched to Stirling. His hopes were heightened, 
I dare say, by the redoubtable Oliver being ill of 
an ague; but Oliver scrambled out of bed in no 
time, and went to work with such energy that he 
got behind the Boyalist army and cut it off from 
all communication with Scotland. There was no- 
thing for it then, but to go on to England; so it 
went on as far as Worcester, where the mayor and 
some of the gentry proclaimed King Charles the 
Second straightway. His proclamation, however, 
was of little use to him, for very few Boyalists ap- 
peared , and on the very same day two people were 
publicly beheaded on Tower Hill for espousing his 
cause. Up came Oliver to Worcester too, at double 
quick speed, and he and his Ironsides so laid about 
them in the great battle which was fought there, that 
they completely beat the Scottish men, and de- 
stroyed the Boyalist army, though the Scottish men 
fought so gallantly that it took five hours to do. 
The escape of Charles after this battle of Wor- 
cester did him good service long afterwards, for it 
induced many of the generous English people to 
take a romantic interest in him, and to think much 
better of him than he ever deserved. He fled in. 
the night with not more than sixty followers to As 
house of a Catholic lady in Staffordshire. There, 
for his greater safety, the whole sixty left him. He 
cropped his hair, stained his face and hands brown 
as if they were sunburnt, put on the clothes of a 
labouring countryman, and went out in the morn- 
ing with his axe in his hand, accompanied by four 
wood-cutters who were brothers , and another man

who was their brother-in-law. These good fellows 
made a bed for him under a tree, as the weather 
was very bad; and the wife of one of them brought 
him food to eat; and the old mother of the four 
brothers came and fell down on her knees before 
him in the wood, and thanked God that her sons 
were engaged in saving his life. At night, he 
came out of the, forest and went on to another 
house which was near the river Severn, with the 
intention of passing into Wales; but the place 
swarmed with soldiers , and the bridges were guarded, 
and all the boats were made fast. So, after lying 
in a hayloft covered over with hay, for some time, 
he came out of this place, attended by Colonel 
Careless , a Catholic gentleman who had met him 
there, and with whom he lay hid, all next day, 
up in the shady branches of a fine old oak. It 
was lucky for the King that it was September-time, 
and that the leaves had not begun to fall, as he 
and the Colonel, perched up in this tree, could 
catch glimpses of the soldiers riding about below, 
and could hear the crash in the wood as they went 
about heating the boughs. 

After this, he walked and walked until his feet 
were all blistered, and, having been concealed all 
one day in a house which was searched by the 
troopers while he was there, went with Lord Wil- 
mot, another of his good friends, to a place called 
Bentley, where one Miss Lane, a Protestant lady, 
had obtained a pass to be allowed to ride through 
the guards to see a relation of hers near Bristol. 
Disguised as a serf ant , he rode on the saddle be*

fore this young lady to the house of Sib John 
Winter, while Lord Wilmot rode thefe boldly, 
like a plain country gentleman, with dogs at his 
heels. It happened that Sir John Winter's butler 
had been a servant in Richmond Palace, and knew 
Charles the moment he set eyes upon him*, but, 
the butler was faithful, and kept the secret. As 
no ship could be found there to carry him abroad, 
it was planned that he should go — still travelling 
with Miss Lane as her servant — : to another house, 
at Trent near Sherborne in Dorsetshire; and then 
Miss Lane and her cousin, Mb. Lasgelles, who 
had gone on horseback beside her all the way, 
went home. I hope Miss Lane was going to marry 
that cousin, for I am sure she must have been a 
brave, kind girl. If I had been that cousin, I 
should certainly have loved her. 

When Charles, lonely for the loss of Miss Lane, 
was safe at Trent, a ship was hired at Lyme, the 
master of which engaged to take two gentlemen to 
France. In the evening of the same day, the King 
— now riding as servant before another young 
lady — set off for a public-house at a place called 
Charmouth, where the captain of the vessel was to 
take him on board. But, the captain ; s wife, being 
afraid of her husband's getting into trouble, locked 
him up, and would not let him sail. Then they 
went away to Bridport, and coming to the inn 
there, found the stable-yard full of soldiers who 
were on the look out for Charles, and who talked 
about him while they drank. He had such pm* 
sence of mind, however, that he led the horses of

his party through the yard as any other servant 
might have done, and said, “Come out of the way, 
you soldiers; let us have room to pass here!” As 
he went along, he met a half-tipsy ostler, who 
robbed his eyes and said to him, “Why, I was 
formerly servant to Mr. Potter at Exeter, and 
surely I have sometimes seen you there, young* 
man?” .He certainly had, for Charles had lodged 
there. His ready answer was, “Ah, I did live with 
him once; but I have no time to talk now. We’ll 
have a pot of beer together when I come back.” 

From this dangerous place he returned to Trent, 
and lay there concealed several days. Then, ho 
escaped to Heale, near Salisbury, where, in the 
house of a widow lady, he was hidden five days, 
until the master of a collier lying off Shoreham in 
Sussex, undertook to convey “a gentleman” to 
France. On the night of the fifteenth of October, 
accompanied by two colonels and a merchant, the 
King rode to Brighton, then a little fishing village, 
to give the captain of the ship a supper before 
going on board; but, so many people knew him, 
that this captain knew him too, and not only he, 
but the landlord and landlady also. Before he 
went away, the landlord came behind his chair, 
kissed his hand, and said he hoped to live to be a 
lord and to see his wife a lady; at which Charles 
laughed. They had had a good supper by this 
time, and plenty of smoking and drinking, at which 
the King was a first-rate hand; so, the captain 
assured him that he would stand by him, and he 
did. It was agreed that the captain should pretend

to sail to Deal, and that Charles should address 
the sailors and sa y he was a gentleman in debt, 
who was running away from his creditors, and that 
he hoped they would join him in persuading the 
captain to put him ashore in France. As the King 
acted his part very well indeed, and gave die 
sailors twenty shillings to drink, they begged the 
captain to do what such a worthy gentleman asked. 
He pretended to yield to their entreaties, and the 
King got safe to Normandy. 

Ireland being now subdued, and Scotland kept 
quiet by plenty of forts and soldiers put there by 
Oliver, the Parliament would have gone on quietly 
enough as far as fighting with any foreign enemy 
went, but for getting into trouble with the Dutch, 
who in the spring of the year one thousand six 
hundred and fifty-one sent a fleet into the Downs 
under their Admiral Van Tromp , to call upon the 
bold English Admiral Blake (who was there with 
half as many ships as the Dutch) to strike his flag* 
Blake fired a raging broadside instead, and beat 
off Van Tromp, who, in the autumn, cam® back 
again with seventy ships, and challenged the bold 
Blake — who still was only half as strong — to 
fight him. Blake fought him all day, but finding 
that the Dutch were too many for him, got quietly 
off at night What does Van Tromp upon this, 
but goes cruising and boasting about the Channel, 
between the North Foreland and the Isle of Wight, 
with a great Dutch broom tied to his mast-head, as 
a sign that he could and would sweep the English 
off the sea! Within three months, Blake lowered

his tone though, and his broom too; for, he and 
two other bold commanders, Dean and Monk, fought 
him three whole days, took twenty -three of his 
ships, shivered his broom to pieces, and settled his 
business. 

Things were no sooner quiet again than the 
army began to complain to the Parliament that 
they were not governing the nation properly, and 
to hint that they thought they could do it better 
themselves. Oliver, who had now made up his 
mind to be the head of the state, or nothing at all, 
supported them in this, and called a meeting of 
officers and his own Parliamentary friends, at his 
lodgings in Whitehall, to consider the best way of 
getting rid of the Parliament. It had now lasted 
just as m^ny years as the King's unbridled power 
had lasted, before it came into existence. The end 
of the deliberation was that Oliver went down to 
the House in his usual plain black dress, with his 
usual grey worsted stockings, but with an unusual 
party of soldiers behind him. These last he left 
in the lobby, and then went in and sat down. Pre- 
sently he got up, made the Parliament a speech, 
told them that the Lord had done with them, 
stamped his foot and said, “You are no Parlia- 
u*ent. Bring them in! Bring them in!” At this 
signal the door flew open, and the soldiers ap- 
peared. “This is not honest,” said Sir Harry 
Vane, one of the members. “Sir Harry Vane!” 
cried Cromwell; “0, Sir Harry Vane! The Lord 
deliver me from Sir Harry Vane!” Then he pointed 
out members one by one, and said this man was a

drunkard, and that man & dissipated fellow, and 
that man a liar, and so on. Then he eaused the 
Speaker to be walked out of his chair, told the 
guard to clear the House, called the mace upon 
the table — which is a sign that the House is 
sitting — “a fool’s bauble,” and said, “Here, 
cany it away!” Being obeyed in all these orders, 
he quietly locked the door, put the key in his 
pocket, walked back to Whitehall again, and told 
his friends, who were still assembled there, what 
he had done. 

They formed a new Council of State after this 
extraordinary proceeding, and got a new Parlia- 
ment together in their own way: which Oliver him- 
self opened in a sort of sermon, and which he said 
was the beginning of a perfect heaven upon earth. 
In this parliament there sat a well-known leather- 
seller , who had taken the singular name of Praise 
God Barebones, and from whom it was called, for 
a joke, Barebones’s Parliament, though its general 
name was the Little Parliament. As it soon ap- 
peared that it was not going to put Oliver in the 
first place, it turned out to be not at all like the 
beginning of heaven upon earth, and Oliver said it 
really was not to be borne with. So he cleared off 
that Parliament in much the same way as he had 
disposed of the other; and then the council of 
officers decided that he must be made the supreme 
authority of the kingdom, under the title of the 
Lord Protector of the Commonwealth. 

So , on the sixteenth of December , one thousand 
nix hundred and fifty-three, a great procession was

framed at Oliver’s door, and he came out in a 
black velvet suit and a big pair of boots, and got 
into his coach and went down to Westminster, at- 
tended by the judges, and the lord mayor, and the 
aldermen, and all the other great and wonderful 
personages of the country. There, in the Court 
of Chancery, he publicly accepted the office of 
Lord Protector. Then he was sworn, and the City 
sword was handed to him , and the seal was handed 
to him, and all the other things were handed to 
him which are usually handed to Kings and Queens 
on state occasions, and handed back again. When 
Oliver had handed them all back, he was quite 
made and completely finished off as Lord Protec- 
tor; and several of the Ironsides preached about it 
at great length, all the evening. 


CHAPTER XLI. 

England under the protectorate of Oliver 

CROMWELL. 

Oliver Cromwell , whom the people long called 
Old Noll, in accepting the office of Protector, had 
hound himself by a certain paper which was handed 
to him, called “the Instrument,” to summon a Par- 
liament, consisting of between four and five hun- 
dred members, in the election of which neither the 
Royalists nor the Catholics were to have any share. 
He had also pledged himself that this Parliament

270 a child’s histoby or England. 

should not be dissolved without its own consent 
until it had sat five months. 

When this Parliament met, Oliver made a speech 
to them of three hours long, very wisely advising 
them what to do for the credit and happiness of 
the country. To keep down the more violent mem- 
bers, he required them to sign a recognition of 
what they were forbidden by u the Instrument” to 
do; which was, chiefly, to take the power from one 
single person at the head of the state or to com- 
mand the army. Then he dismissed them to go to 
work. With his usual vigour and resolution he 
went to work himself with some frantic preachers 
who were rather overdoing their sermons in calling 
him a villain and a tyrant, by shutting up their 
chapels, and sending a few of them off to prison. 

There was not at that time, in England or any- 
where else, a man so able to govern the country 
as Oliver Cromwell. Although he ruled with a 
strong hand, and levied a very heavy tax on the 
Royalists (but not until they had plotted against 
his life), he ruled wisely, and as the times required. 
He caused England to be so respected abroad, that 
I wish some lords and gentlemen who have go- 
verned it under kings and queens in later days 
would have taken a leaf out of Oliver Cromwell’s 
book. He sent bold Admiral Blake to the Medi- 
terranean Sea, to make the Duke of Tuscany pay 
sixty thousand pounds for injuries he had done to 
British subjects, and spoliation he had committed 
on English merchants. He further despatched him 
and his fleet to Algiers, Tunis,' and Tripoli, to

have every English ship and every Englishman de- 
livered up to him that had been taken by pirates 
in those parts. All this was gloriously done; and 
it began to be thoroughly well known, all over the 
world, that England was governed by a man in 
earnest, who would not allow the English name to 
be insulted or slighted anywhere. 

These were not all his foreign triumphs. He 
sent a fleet to sea against the Dutch; and the two 
powers, each with one hundred ships upon its side, 
met in the English Channel, off the North Fore- 
land, where the fight lasted all day long. Dean 
was killed in this fight; but Monk, who commanded 
in the same ship with him, threw his cloak over 
bis body that the sailors might not know of his 
death and be disheartened. Nor were they. Their 
English broadsides so exceedingly astonished the 
Dutch that they sheered off at last, though the re- 
doubtable Van Tromp fired upon them with his 
own guns for deserting their flag. Soon afterwards, 
the two fleets engaged again, off the coast of Hol- 
land. There, the valiant Van Tromp was Bhot 
through the heart, and the Dutch gave in, and 
peace was made. 

Further than this, Oliver resolved not to bear 
the domineering and bigoted conduct of Spain, 
which country not only claimed a right to all the 
gold and silver that could be found in South America, 
and treated the ships of all other countries who vi- 
sited those regions as pirates, but put English sub- 
jects into the horrible Spanish prisons of the In- 
quisition. So, Oliver told the Spanish ambassador

that English ships must be free to go wherever they 
would, and that English merchants must not be 
thrown into those same dungeons, no, not for the 
pleasure of all the priests in Spain. To this, the 
Spanish ambassador replied that the gold and Bilver 
country, and the Holy Inquisition, were his King's 
two eyes , neither of which he could submit to have 
put out. Very well, said Oliver, then he was 
afraid he must damage those two eyes directly. 

So, another fleet was despatched under two 
commanders, Penn and Venables, for Hispaniola; 
where, however, the Spaniards got the better pf it 
Consequently, the fleet came home again, after 
taking Jamaica on the way. Oliver, indignant with 
the two commanders who had not done what bold 
Admiral Blake would have done, clapped them 
both into prison, declared war against Spain, and 
made a treaty with France, in virtue of which it 
was to shelter the King and his brother the Duke 
of York no longer. Then, he sent a fleet abroad 
under bold Admiral Blake, which brought the King 
of Portugal to his senses — just to keep its hand 
in — • and then engaged a Spanish fleet, sunk four 
great ships, and took two more, laden with sil ver 
to the value of two millions of pounds: which daz- 
zling prize was brought from Portsmouth to Lon- 
don in waggons, with the populace of all the towns 
and villages through which the waggons passed, 
shouting with all their might. After this victory) 
bold Admiral Blake sailed away to the port of 
Santa Cruz to cut off the Spanish treasure-ships 
^coming from Mexico. There he found them, ten

*U number, with seven others to take care of them, 
and a big castle, and seven batteries, all roaring 
and blazing away at him with great guns. Blake 
cared no more for great guns than for pop-guns — 
no more for their hot iron balls than for snow- 
balls. He dashed into the harbor., captured and 
burnt every one of the ships, and came sailing out 
again triumphantly, with the victorious English 
flag flying at his mast-head. This was the last 
triumph of this great commander, who had sailed 
and fought until he was quite worn out. He died 
as his successful ship was coming into Plymouth 
Harbor amidst the joyful acclamations of the people, 
and was buried in state in Westminster Abbey. 
Not to lie there, long. 

Over and above all this, Oliver found that the 
Vaudois, or Protestant people of the valleys of 
Lucerne, were insolently treated by the Catholic 
powers, and were even put to death for their re- 
ligion, in an audacious and bloody manner. In* 
stantly, he informed those powers that this was a 
thing which Protestant England would not allow; 
and he speedily carried his point through the might 
of his great name, and established their right to 
worship God in peace after their own harmless 
manner. 

Lastly, his English army won such admiration 
in fighting with the Erench against the Spaniards, 
that, after they had assaulted the town of Dunkirk 
together, the French King in person gave it up to 
the English, that it might be a token to them of 
their might and valour.

There Were plots enough Against Oliver among

publicans. He had a difficult game to play, for 
the Royalists WOrC always ready to side with either

too, as Charles was oalled, had no scruple* about 
plotting with any one against his life; although 
there is reason to suppose that he would willingly 
have married one of his daughters , if Oliver would 
have had such a son-in-law. There Wat a certain

cored such sources of information as his enemies 
little dreamed of. There was a chosen body of six 
persons, called the Sealed Knot, who were in the 
closest and most secret confidence of Charles. One 
of the foremost of these very men, a Sib Richard 
Willis, reported to Oliver everything that passed 
among them, and had two hundred a year for it. 

Miles Syndabcome, also of the old army, was 
another conspirator against the Protector. He and 
a man named Cecil, bribed one of his Life Guards 
to let them have good notice when he was going 
out — intending to shoot him from a window. But, 
owing either to his caution or his good fortune, 
they could never get an aim at him. Disappointed 
in thiB design, they got into the chapel in White- 
ball, with a basketful of combustibles, which were 
to explode by means of a slow match in six hours ; 
then, in the noise and confusion of the fire they 
hoped to kill Oliver. But, the Life Guardsman 
himself disclosed this plot; and they were seized, 
and Miles died (or killed himself in prison) a little

such plotters Oliver caused to be beheaded, a few 
more to be hanged, and many more, including 
those who rose in arms against him, to be sent as

was impartial too , in asserting the laws of Eng- 
land. When a Portuguese nobleman , the brother 
of the Portuguese ambassador, killed a London 
citizen in mistake for another man with whom he 
had had a quarrel, Oliver caused him to be tried 
before a jury of Englishmen and foreigners, and

had him executed in spite of the entreaties of all 
the ambassadors in London. 

One of Oliver’s pwn friends, the Duke of Ol- 
denbubgh, in sending him a present of six fine 
coach-horses, was very near doing more to please 
the Royalists than all the plotters put together. 
One day, Oliver went with his coach drawn by 
these six horses, into Hyde Park, to dine with his 
secretary and some of his other gentlemen under 
the trees there. After dinner, being merry, he took 
it into his head to put them inside and to drive 
home: a postillion riding one of the foremost horses, 
as the custom was. On account of Oliver’s being 
too free with the whip, the six fine horses went off 
at a gallop, the postillion got thrown, and Oliver 
fell upon the coach-pole and norrowly escaped being 
phot by his own pistol, which got entangled with 
his clothes in the harness and went off. He was 
dragged some distance by the foot, until his foot 
came out of the shoe, and then he came safely to 
the ground under the broad body of the coach, and 
was very little the worse. The gentlemen inside 
were only bruised, and the discontented people of 
all parties were much disappointed. 

The rest of the history of the Protectorate of 
Oliver Cromwell is a history of his Parliaments. 
His first one not pleasing him at all, he waited 
until the five months were out, and then dissolved 
it. The next was better suited to his views, and 
from that he desired to get — if he could with 
safety to himself — the title of King. He had had 
this in his mind some time: whether because he

thought that the English people, being more used 
to the title, were more likely to obey it; or whether 
because he really wished to be a king himself, and 
to leave the succession to that title in his family, 
is far from clear. He was already as high, in Eng- 
land and in all the world, as he would ever be, 
and I doubt myself if he cared for the mere name. 
However, a paper, called the “Humble Petition 
and Advice,” was presented to him by the House 
of Commons, praying him to take a high title and 
to appoint his successor. That he would have taken 
the title of King there is no doubt, but for the 
strong opposition of the army. This induced him 
to forbear, and to assent only to the other points 
of the petition. Upon which occasion there was 
another grand show in Westminster Hall, when the 
Speaker of the House of Commons formally in- 
vested him with a purple robe lined with ermine, 
and presented him with a splendidly bound Bible, 
and put a golden sceptre in his hand. The next 
time the Parliament met he called a House of Lords 
of sixty members, as the petition gave him power 
to do; but as that Parliament did not please him 
either, and would not proceed to the business of 
the country, he jumped into a coach one morning, 
took six Guards with him, and sent them to the 
right-about. I wish this had been a warning to 
Parliaments to avoid long speeches, and do more 
work. 

It was the month of August, one thousand six 
hundred and fifty -eight, when Oliver Cromwell’s 
favorite daughter , Elizabeth Claypole (who had

lately lost her youngest son), lay very ill, and his 
mind wag greatly troubled, because he lured her 
dearly. Another of his daughters was married to 
Lord Falconberg, another to the grandson o£ the 
Earl of Warwick, and he had made his son Richard 
one of the Members of the Upper House. He was 
very kind and loving to them all,, being a good 
father and a good husband, but he loved this 
daughter the best of the family, and wait down to 
Hampton Court to see her, and could hardly he 
induced to stir from her sick room until she died. 
Although his religion had been of a gloomy kind, 
his disposition had been always cheerful. He had 
been fond of music in his home, and had kept 
open house once a week for all officers of the army 
not below the rank of a captain, and had always 
preserved in his house a quiet, sensible dignity. 
He encouraged men of genius and learning, and 
loved to have them about him. Milton was one 
of bis great friends. He was good-humoured too, 
with the nobility, whose dresses and manners were 
very different from his ; and to show them what good 
information he had, he would sometimes jokingly 
tell them when they were at his house, where they 
had last drank the health of the “King over the 
water,” and would recommend them to be more 
private (if they could) another time. But he had 
lived in busy times , bad borne the weight of heavy 
State affairs, and had often gone in fear of his life. 
He was ill of the gout and ague; and when the 
death of his beloved child came upon him in ad- 
dition, he sank, never to raise his head again. He

told hia physicians on the twenty-fourth of August 
that the Lord had assured him that he wma not die 
in that illness, and that he would certainly get 
hotter. This was only his si ok fancy, for on 
the, third of September, which was the anniversary 
of the great battle of Wor pester, and the day of 
the year which he called his fortunate day, he 
died, in the sixtieth year of his age. He had been 
delirious, and had lain insensible some hours, but 
he had been overheard to murmur a very good 
prayer the day before. The whole country la- 
mented his death. If you want to know the real 
worth of Oliver Cromwell, and his real services to 
his country, you can hardly do better than com- 
pare England under him, with England under 
Charles the Second. 

Ge had appointed his son Riehard to sueceed 
him, and after there had been, at Somerset House 
in the Strand, a lying in state more splendid than 
sensible — as all such vanities after death are, I 
think — Richard became Lord Protector. He was 
an amiable country gentleman, but had none of 
his father's genius , and was quite unfit for such a 
post in such a storm of parties. Richard's Pro- 
tectorate, which only lasted a year and a half, is 
a history of quarrels between the officers of the 
army and the Parliament, and between the officers 
among themselves, and of a growing discontent 
among the people, who had far too many long 
sermons and far too few amusements, and wanted 
a change. At last, General Monk got the army

well into his -own hands, and then, in pursuance 
of a secret plan he seems to have entertained from 
the time of Oliver’s death, declared for the King’s 
cause. He did not do this openly; but, in his place 
in the House of Commons, as one of the members 
for Devonshire, strongly advocated the proposals 
of one Sir John Greenville, who came to the 
House with a letter from Charles, dated from Breda, 
and with whom he had previously been in secret 
communication. There had been plots and counter- 
plots , and a recall of the last members of the Dong 
Parliament, and an end of the Long Parliament, 
and risings of the Royalists that were made too 
soon; and most men being tired out, and there 
being no one to head the country now Oliver was 
dead, it was readily agreed to welcome Charles 
Stuart. Some of the wiser and better members said 
— what was most true — that in the letter from 
Breda, he made no real promise to govern well, 
and that it would be best to make him pledge him- 
self beforehand as to what he should be bound to 
do for the benefit of the kingdom. Monk said, 
however, it would be all right when he came, and 
he could not come too soon. 

So, eveiybody found out all in a moment that 
the country must be prosperous and happy, having 
another Stuart to condescend to reign over it; and 
there was a prodigious firing off of guns, lighting 
of bonfires, ringing of bells, and throwing up of 
caps. The people drank the King’s health by thou- 
sands in the open streets, and everybody rejoiced. 
Down came the Arms of the Commonwealth, up

went the Royal Arms instead, and out came the 
public money. Fifty thousand pounds for the King, 
ten thousand pounds for his brother the Duke of 
York, five thousand pounds for his brother the 
Bake of Gloucester. Prayers for these gracious 
Stuarts were put up in all the churches; commis- 
sioners were sent to Holland (which suddenly found 
out that Charles was a great man, and that it loved 
him) to invite the King home; Monk and the 
Kentish grandees went to Dover, to kneel down 
before him as he landed. He kissed and embraced 
Monk, made him ride in the coach with himself 
and his brothers, came on to London amid wonder* 
ful shoutings , and passed through the army at 
Blackheath on the twenty-ninth of May (his birth- 
day), in the year one thousand six hundred and 
sixty. Greeted by splendid dinners under tents, 
by flags and tapestry streaming from all the houses, 
by delighted crowds in all the streets, by troops of 
noblemen and gentlemen in rich dresses, by City 
companies, trainbands, drummers, trumpeters, the 
great Lord Mayor, and the majestic Aldermen, the 
King went on to Whitehall. On entering it, he 
commemorated his Restoration with the joke that it

A child's HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


CHAPTER XLIL 

ENGLAND VNDER CHARLES THE SECOND. 

There never were such profligate times in Eng* 
land aa under Charles the Second. Whenever you 
see his portrait, with his swarthy ill-looking face 
and great nose, you may fancy him in his Court 
at Whitehall, surrounded by some of the very worst 
vagabonds in the kingdom (though they were lords 
and ladies), drinking, gambling, indulging fa 
vicious conversation , and committing every kind of 
profligate excess. It has been a fashion to cell 
Charles the Second u The Merry Monarch.” 1 $ 
me try to give you a general idea of some of the 
merry things that were done, in the merry day 8 
when this merry gentleman sat upon his merry 
throne, in merry England. 

The first merry proceeding was of eourse 
to declare that he was one of the greatest, the 
wisest, and the noblest kings that ever shone, like 
the blessed sun itself, on this benighted earth. The 
next merry and pleasant piece of business was, for 
the Parliament, in the humblest manner, to gfr fl 
him one million two hundred thousand pounds s 
year, and to settle upon him for life that old dis- 
puted tonnage and poundage which had been so 
bravely fought for. Then, General Monk , being made 
Earl of Albemarle, and a few other Royalists 
similarly rewarded, the law went to work to see

what was to be done to those persons (they were 
caUed Regicides) who had been concerned in making 
a martyr of the late Kang. Ten of these were 
merrily executed;, that is to say, six of the judges, 
one of the council, Colonel Hacker and another 
officer who had commanded the Guards, and Hugh 
Peters, a preacher, who had preached against the 
martyr with all his heart. These executions were 
so extremely merry, that every horrible circum- 
stance which Cromwell had abandoned was revived 
with appalling cruelty. The hearts of the sufferers 
were tom out of their living bodies; their bowels 
were burned before their faces; the executioner cut 
jokes to the next victim, as he rubbed his filthy 
hands together that were reeking with the blood of 
the last; and the heads of the dead were drawn on 
8ledges with the living to the place of suffering. 
Still, even so merry a monarch could not force 
one of these dying men to say that he was sorry 
for what he had done. Nay, the most memorable 
thing said among them was, that if the thing were 
to dto again they would do it. 

Sir Harry Vane, who had furnished the evidence 
against Strafford, and was one of the most staunch 
of the Republicans, was also tried, found guilty, 
and ordered for execution. When he came upon 
the scaffold on Tower Hill, after conducting his 
own defence with great power, his notes of what 
he had meant to say to the people were torn away 
froih him, and the drums and trumpets were ordered 
to sound lustily and drown his voice; for, the 
people had been so much impressed by what the

284 ▲ child’s history of shgland. 

Regicides had calmly said with their last breath, 
that it was the custom now, to have the drums 
and trumpets always under the scaffold, ready to 
strike up. Vane said no more than this: “It is a 
bad cause which cannot bear the words of a dying 
man ,” and bravely died. 

These merry scenes were succeeded by another, 
perhaps even merrier. On the anniversary of the 
late King’s death, the bodies of Oliver Cromwell, 
Ireton, and Bradshaw, were torn out of their graves 
in Westminster Abbey, dragged to Tyburn, hanged 
there on a gallows all day long, and then be- 
headed. Imagine the head of Oliver Cromwell set 
upon a pole to be stared at by a brutal crowd, not 
one of whom would have dared to look the living 
Oliver in the face for half a moment! Think, after 
you have read this reign, what England Was under 
Oliver Cromwell who was torn out of his grave, 
and under this merry monarch who sold it, like a 
merry Judas, over and over again. 

Of course, the remains of Oliver’s wife and 
daughter were not to be spared either, though they 
had been most excellent women. The base clergy 
of that time gave up their bodies , which were 
buried in the Abbey, and — to the eternal dis- 
grace of England — they were thrown into a pit* 
together with the mouldering bones of Pym and of

The clergy acted this disgraceful part because 
they hoped to get the nonconformists or dissenters 
thoroughly put down in this reign, and to have

but one prayer-book and one service for all kinds 
of people, no matter what their private opinions 
were. This was pretty well, I think, for a Pro- 
testant Church, which had displaced the Romish 
Church because people had a right to their own 
opinions in religious matters. However, they car- 
ried it with a high hand, and a prayer-book was 
agreed upon, in which the extremest opinions of 
Archbishop Laud were not forgotten. An act was 
passed, too, preventing any dissenter from holding 
any office under any corporation. So, the regular 
clergy in their triumph were soon as merry as the 
King. The army being by this time disbanded, 
and the King crowned, everything was to go on 
easily for ever more. 

I must say a word here, about the King’s fa- 
mily. He had not been long upon the throne when 
his brother the Duke of Gloucester, and his sister 

Princess op Orange , died within a few months 
of each other, of the small-pox. His remaining 
sister, the Princess Henrietta, married the Duke 
of Orleans, the brother of Louis the Four- 
teenth, Kang of France. His brother James, 
Dues op York, was made High Admiral, and by 
and by became a Catholic. He was a gloomy, 
Bullen, bilious sort of man, with a remarkable par- 
tiality for the ugliest women in the country. He 
married, under very discreditable circumstances, 
•Anne Hyde, the daughter of Lord Clarendon, 
then the King’s principal Minister — not at all a 
delicate minister either, but doing much of the dirty 
*ork of a very dirty palace. It became important

now, that the King himself should be married; and 
divers foreign MonarchB, not very particular about 
the character of their son-in-law, proposed their 
daughters to him. The King op Portugal offered 
his daughter, Catherine of Braganza, and fifty 
thousand pounds: in addition to which the French 
King, who was favorable to that match, offered a 
loan of another fifty thousand. The King of Spain, 
on the other hand, offered any one out of a dozen 
of Princesses , and other hopes of gain. But the 
ready money carried the day, and Catherine came 
over in state to her merry marriage. 

The whole Court was a great flaunting crowd of 
debauched men and shameless women; and Cathe- j 
rine’s merry husband insulted and outraged her in 
every possible way, until she consented to receive 
those worthless creatures as her very good friends, j 
and to degrade herself by their companionship. A : 
Mrs. Palmer, whom the King made Lady Castle- j 
maine, and afterwards Duchess of Cleveland, 
was one of the most powerful of the had women 
about the Court, and had great influence with the 
King nearly all through his reign. Another merry 
lady, named Moll Davies , a dancer at the theatre, 
was afterwards her rival. So was Nell Gwen, 
first an orange girl and then an actress, who really 
had some good in her, and of whom one of the 
worst things I know, is, that she actually does 
seem to have been fond of the King. The first 
Duke of St. Albans was this orange girl’s child. 
In like manner, the son of a merry waiting-lady, 
whom the King created Duchess of Portsmouth*

became the op Richmond. Upon the whole, 

it id Dot do bad a thing to be a commoner. 

The Merry Monarch was so exceedingly merry 
among these merry ladies , and some equally merry 
(and equally infamous) lords and gentlemen, that 
he soon got through his hundred thousand pounds, 
and then, by way of raising a little pocket-money, 
made a merry bargain. He sold Dunkirk to the 
French King for five millions of livres. When I 
think of the dignity to which Oliver Cromwell 
raised England in the eyes of foreign powers, and 
when I think of the manner in which he gained 
for England this very Dunkirk, I am much in- 
clined to consider that if the Merry Monarch had 
been made to follow his father for this action he 
would have received his just deserts. 

Though he was like his father in none of that 
father’s greater qualities, he was undoubtedly like 
him in being worthy of no trust. When he sent 
that letter to the Parliament, from Breda, he did 
expressly promise that all sincere religious opinions 
should be respected. Yet he was no sooner firm 
in his power than he consented to one of the worst 
Acts of Parliament ever passed. Under this law, 
every minister who should not give his solemn 
assent to the Prayer-Book by a certain day was 
declared to be a minister no longer, and to be de- 
prived Of his church. The con&equenee of this was 
that some two thousand honest men were taken 
from their congregations , and reduced to dire 
poverty and distress. It was followed by another

outrageous law, called the Conventicle Act, by 
which any person above the age of sixteen who 
was present at any religious service not according 
to the Prayer-Book, was to be imprisoned three 
months for the first offence, and six for the second, 
and to be transported for the third. This Act alone 
filled the prisons, which were then most villanous 
dungeons , to overflowing. 

The Covenanters in Scotland had already fared 
no better. A base Parliament, usually known as 
the Drunken Parliament, in consequence of its 
principal members being seldom sober, had been 
got together to make laws against the Covenanters, 
and to force all men to be of one mind in religious 
matters. The Marquis op Argyle , relying on the 
King’s honor, had given himself up to him; but, 
he was wealthy, and his enemies wanted his wealth. 
He was tried for treason on the evidence of some 
private letters, in which he had expressed opinions 
— as well he might — more favorable to the go- 
vernment of the late Lord Protector than of the 
present merry and religious King. He was exe- 
cuted, as were two men of mark among the Cove- 
nanters; and Sharp, a traitor who had once been 
the friend of the Presbyterians and betrayed them, 
was made Archbishop of St. Andrew’s , to teach the 
Scotch how to like bishops. 

Things being in this merry state at home, the 
Merry Monarch undertook a war with the Dutch; 
principally because they interfered with an African 
company, established with the two objects of buying

golddust and slaves, of which the Duke of York 
was a leading member. After some preliminary 
hostilities, the said Duke sailed to the toast 6f 
Holland with a fleet of ninety -eight vessels of war, 
and four fire-ships. This engaged with the Dutch 
fleet, of no fewer than one hundred and thirteen 
ships. In the great battle between the two forces 
the Dutch lost eighteen ships, four admirals, and 
seven thousand men. But, the English on shore 
were in no mood of Exultation when they heard 
the news. 

For, this was the year and the time of tho Great 
Plague in London. During the winter of one thou- 
sand six hundred and sixty- four it had been 
whispered about, that some few people had died 
here and there of the disease called the Plague, in 
some of the unwholesome suburbs around London. 
News was not published at that time as it is now, 
and some people believed these rumours, and some 
disbelieved them, and they were soon forgotten. 
But, in the month of May, one thousand six hun- 
dred and sixty-five, it began to be said all over the 
town that the disease had burst out with great 
violence in St. Giles’s, and that the people were 
dying in great numbers. This soon turned out to 
be awfully true. The roads out of London were 
choked up by people endeavouring to escape from 
the infected city, and large sums were paid for 
any kind of conveyance. The disease soon spread 
so fast that it was necessary to shut up the houses 
in which sick people were, and to cut them off

from communication with the living. Every one of 
these houses was marked on the outside of the 
door with a red cross, and the words, Lord, have 
mercy upon us! The streets were all deserted, grass 
grew in the public ways , and there was a dreadful 
silence in the air. When night came on, dismal 
rumblings used to be heard, and these were the 
wheels of the death -carts, attended by. men with 
veiled faces and holding cloths to their mouths, 
who rang doleful bells and cried in a loud and 
solemn voice, “Bring out your dead!” The corpses 
put into these carts were buried* by torchlight in 
great pits; no service being performed over them; 
all men being afraid to stay for a moment on the 
brink of the ghastly graves. In the general fear, 
children ran away from their parents , and parents 
from their children. Some who were taken ill, died 
alone and without any help. Some were stabbed 
or strangled by hired nurses, who robbed them of 
all their money and stole the very beds on which 
they lay. Some went mad, dropped from the 
windows, ran through the streets, and in their pain 
and frenzy flung themselves into the river. 

These were not all the horrors of the time. The 
wicked and dissolute, in wild desperation, sat in 
the taverns singing roaring songs, and were stricken 
as they drunk, and went out and. died. The fear- 
ful and superstitious persuaded themselves that they 
saw supernatural sights — burning swords in the 
sky, gigantic arms and darts. Others pretended 
that at night vast crowds of ghosts walked round 
and round the dismal pits. One madman, naked,

and carrying a brazier fall of burning coals upon 
his bead, stalked through the streets, crying out 
that he was a Prophet, commissioned to denounce 
the vengeance of the Lord on wicked London. An- 
other always went to and fro, exclaiming, “Yet 
forty days, and London shall be destroyed !” A 
third awoke the echoes in the dismal streets, by 
night and by day, and made the blood of the sick 
run cold, by calling out incessantly, in a deep, 
hoarse voice, “0, the great and dreadful God!” 

Through the months of July and August and 
September, the Great Plague raged more and more. 
Great fires were lighted in the streets, in the hope 
of stopping the infection; but there was a plague 
of rain too, and it beat the fires out. At last, the 
winds which usually arise at that time of the year 
which is called the equinox, when day and night 
are of equal length all over the world, began to 
blow , and to purify the wretched town. The deaths 
began to decrease, the red crosses slowly to dis- 
appear, the fugitives to return, the shops to open 
again, pale frightened faces to be seen in the 
streets. The Plague had been in every part of 
England, but in close and unwholesome London it 
had killed one hundred thousand people. 

All this time, the Merry Monarch was as merry 
as ever, and as worthless as ever* All this time, 
the debauched lords and gentlemen and the shame- 
less ladies danced and gamed and drank, and 
loved and hated one another, according to their 
merry ways. So little humanity did the govern- 
ment learn from the late affliction, that one of the

first things the Parliament did when it met at Ox- 
ford (being as yet afraid to come to London), was 
to make a law, called the Five Mile Act, expressly 
directed against those poor ministers who, in the 
time of the Plague, had manfully come hack to 
comfort the unhappy people. This infamous law, 
by forbidding them to teach in any school, or to 
eome within five miles of any city, town, or village, 
doomed them to starvation and death. 

The fleet had been at sea, and healthy. The 
King of France was now in alliance with the Dutch, 
though his navy was chiefly employed in looking 
on while the English and Dutch fought The Dutch 
gained one victory; and the English gained an- 
other and a greater; and Prince Rupert, one of 
the English admirals, was out for the French Ad- 
miral, with the intention of giving him something 
more to do than he had had yet, when the gale 
increased to a storm, and blew him into Saint 
Helen’s. That night was the third of September, 
one thousand six hundred and sixty -six, and that 
wind fanned the Great Fire of London. 

It broke out at a baker’s shop near London 
Bridge, on the spot on which the Monument now 
stands as a remembrance of those raging flames. 
It spread and spread, and burned and burned, for 
three days. The nights were lighter than the days; 
in the day-time there was an immense cloud of 
smoke, and in the night-time there was a great 
tower of fire mounting up into the sky, which 
lighted the whole country landscape for ten miles 
round. Showers of hot ashes rose into the air and

fell on distant places; dying sparks carried the 
conflagration to great distances, and kindled it in 
twenty new spots at a time; church steeples fell 
down with tremendous crashes; houses crumbled 
into cinders by the hundred and the thousand. The 
summer had been intensely hot and dry, the streets 
were very narrow, and the houses mostly built of 
wood and plaster. Nothing could stop the tremen- 
dous fire but the want of more houses to burn; 
nor did it stop until the whole way from the Tower 
to Temple Bar was a desert, composed of the 
ashes of thirteen thousand houses and eighty-nine 
churches. 

This was a terrible visitation at the time, and 
occasioned great loss and suffering to the two hun- 
dred thousand burnt-out people, who were obliged 
to lie in the fields under the open night sky, or in 
hastily -made huts of mud and straw, while the 
lanes and roads were rendered impassable by carts 
which had broken down as they tried to save their 
goods. But the Fire was a great blessing to the 
City afterwards , for it arose from its ruins very 
much improved — built more regularly , more 
widely, more cleanly and carefully, and therefore 
much more healthily. It might be far more healthy 
than it is, but there are some people in it still — 
even now, at this time, nearly two hundred years 
later — so selfish, so pig-headed, and so ignorant, 
that I doubt if even another Great Fire would 
warm them up to do their duty. 

The Catholics were accused of having wilfully 
set London in flames; one poor Frenchman, who

had been mad for years , even accused himself of 
having with his own hand fired the first house. 
There is no reasonable doubt, however, that the 
fire was accidental. An inscription on the Monu- 
ment long attributed it to the Catholics; but it is 
removed now, and was always a malicious and 
stupid untruth. 


CHAPTER XLIIL 

ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE SECOND. 

That the Merry Monarch might be very merry 
indeed in the merry times when his people were 
suffering under pestilence and fire, he drank and 
gambled and flung away among his favorites the 
money which the Parliament had voted for the war. 
The consequence of this was , that the stout-hearted 
English sailors were merrily starving of want .and 
dying in the streets ; while the Dutch, under their 
admirals De Witt and De Ruyter, came into the 
River Thames, and even up the River Medway as 
far as Upnor, burned the guard-ships, silenced the 
weak batteries, and did what they would to the 
English coast for six whole weeks. Most of the 
English ships that could have prevented them had 
neither powder nor shot on board; in tins merry 
reign, public officers made themselves as merry a* 
the Eking did with the public money; and when it 
was entrusted to them to spend in national de-

fences or preparations , they put it into their own 
pockets with the merriest grace in the world. 

Lord Clarendon had, by this time, run as long 
a course as is usually allotted to the unscrupulous 
ministers of bad kings. He was impeached by his 
politieal opponents, but unsuccessfully. The King 
then commanded him to withdraw from England 
and retire to France, which he did, after defending 
himself in writing. He was no great loss at home, 
and died abroad some seven years afterwards. 

There then came into power a ministry called 
the Cabal Ministry , because it was composed of 
Lord Clifford, . the Earl of Arlington, the 
Duke of Buckingham (a great rascal, formerly 
Earl of Rochester, and the King’s most powerful 
favorite), Lord Ashley, and the Duke of Lau- 
derdale*, c. A. b. A. l. As the French were making 
conquests in Flanders , the first Cabal proceeding 
was to make a treaty with the Dutch for uniting 
with Spain to oppose the French. It was no sooner 
made than the Merry Monarch, who always wanted 
to get money without being accountable to a Parlia- 
ment for his expenditure, apologised to the King 
of France for having had anything to do with it, 
and concluded a secret treaty with him, making 
himself his infamous pensioner to the amount of 
two millions of livres down, and three millions more 
a year; and engaging to desert that very Spain, to 
make war against those very Dutch, and to de- 
clare himself a Catholic when a convenient time 
should arrive. This religious King had lately been 
crying to bis Catholic brother on the subject of bis

strong desire to be a Catholie; and now be merrily 
concluded this treasonable conspiracy against the 
country he governed, by undertaking to become one 
as soon as he safely could. For all of which, 
though he had had ten merry heads instead of 01% 
he richly deserved to lose them by the headsman’s 
axe. 

As his one merry head might have been far 
from safe if these thing* had been known, they 
were kept very quiet, and war was declared by 
France and England against the Dutch. But, a 
very uncommon man, afterwards most important to 
English history and to the religion and liberty of 
this land, arose among them, and for many long 
years defeated the whole projects of France. This 
was William of Nassau, Prince of Orange, son 
of the last Prince of Orange of the same name, who 
married the daughter of Charles the First of Eng* 
land. He was a young man at this time, only 
just of age; but he was brave, cool, intrepid and 
wise. His father had been so detested that, upon 
his death, the Dutch had ^abolished the authority 
to which this son would have otherwise succeeded 
(Stadtholder, it was called} and placed the chief 
power in the hands of John de Witt, who edu- 
cated this young prince. Now, the Prince became 
very popular, and John De Witt’s brother Corne- 
lius was sentenced to banishment on a false accu- 
sation of conspiring to kill him. John west to the 
prison where he was, to take him away to exile, 
in his coach; and a great mob who collected on the 
occasion, then and there cruelly murdered both the

brothers. This left the government in the hands 
of the Prince, who was really the choice of the na- 
tion*, and from this time he exercised it with the 
greatest vigour, against the whole power of Prance 
under its famous generals Cond£ and Tubenne, and 
in support of the Protestant religion. It was full 
b even years before this war ended in a treaty of 
peace made at Nimeguen, and its details would 
occupy a very considerable space. It is enough to 
say that William of Orange established a famous 
character with the whole world; and that the Merry 
Monarch, adding to and improving on his former 
baseness, bound himself to do everything the King 4 
of Prance liked, and nothing the King of Prance 
did not like, for a pension of one hundred thousand 
pounds a year, which was afterwards doubled. Be- 
sides this , the King of France , by means of his 
corrupt ambassador — who wrote accounts of his 
proceedings in England, which are not always to 
he believed, I think — bought our English mem- 
bers of Parliament as he wanted them. So, in 
point of fact, during a considerable portion of this 
merry reign, the King of Prance was the real King 
of this country. 

But there was a better time to come, and it was 
to come (though his royal uncle little thought so) 
through that very William, Prince of Orange. He 
came over to England, saw Maly the elder daughter 
of the Duke of York, and married her. We shall 
see by and bye what came of that marriage, and 
why it is never to be forgotten. 

This daughter was a Protestant, hut her mother

died a Catholic, She and her sister Anne, also & 
Protestant, were the only survivors of eight children. 
Anne afterwards married George , Prince of Den- 
mark, brother to the King of that country. 

Lest you should do the Merry Monarch the in- 
justice of supposing that he was even good-hu- 
moured (except when he had everything his own 
way), or that he was high-spirited and honorable, 
I will mention here what was done to a Member of 
the House of Commons, Sir John Coventry. He 
made a remark in a debate about taxing the theatres, 
which gave the King offence. He agreed with his 
illegitimate son, who had been bom abroad, and 
whom he had made Duke of Monmouth, to take 
the following merry vengeance. To waylay him 
at night, fifteen armed men to one, and to slit his 
nose with a penknife. Like master, like man. The 
King's favorite, the Duke of Buckingham, was 
strongly suspected of setting on an assassin to 
murder the Duke of Ormond as he was returning 
home from a dinner; and that Duke's spirited son, 
Lord Ossory, was so persuaded of his guilt, that 
he said to him at Court, even as he stood beside 
the King, “My Lord, I know very well that you 
are at the bottom of this late attempt upon my 
father. But I give you warning! If he ever come 
to a violent end, his blood shall be upon you, and, 
wherever I meet you I will pistol you! I will do 
so, though I find you standing behind the King's 
chair, and I tell you this in Hin Majesty's pre- 
sence that you may be quite sure of my doing 
what I threaten." Those were merry times indeed.

There was a fellcnfr named Blood, who was 
seized for making, with two companions, an auda- 
cious attempt to steal the crown, the globe, and 
sceptre, from the place where the jewels were kept, 
in the Tower. This robber, who was a swaggering 
ruffian, being taken, declared that he was the man 
who had endeavoured to kill the Duke of Ormond, 
and that he had meant to kill the King too, but 
was overawed by the majesty of his appearance, 
when he might otherwise have done it, as he was 
bathing at Battersea. The Bang being but an ill- 
looking fellow, I don’t believe a word of this. 
Whether he was flattered, or whether he knew that 
Buckingham had really set Blood on to murder the 
Duke, is uncertain. But it is quite certain that he 
pardoned this thief, gave him an estate of five hun- 
dred a year in Breland (which had had the honor 
of giving him birth), and presented him at Court 
to the debauched lords and the shameless ladies, 
who made a great deal of him — as I have no 
doubt they would have made of the Devil himself, 
if the King had introduced him. 

Infamously pensioned as he was , the King still 
wanted money, and consequently was obliged to 
call Parliaments. In these, the great object of the 
Protestants was to thwart the Catholic Duke of 
York, who married a second time; his new wife 
being a young lady only fifteen years old, the Ca- 
tholic sister of the Duke of Modena. In this they 
were seconded by the Protestant Dissenters, though 
to their own disadvantage, since, to exclude Ca- 
tholics from power, they were even willing to ex-

elude themselves. The King’s object was to pre- 
tend to he a Protestant, while he was really a Ca- 
tholic; to swear to the bishops that he was de- 
votedly attached to the English Church, while he 
knew he had bargained it away to the King of 
France; and, by cheating and deceiving them, and 
all who were attached to royalty, to become des- 
potic and be powerful enough to confess what a 
rascal he was. Meantime, the King of France, 
knowing his merry pensioner well, intrigued with 
the King’s opponents in Parliament, as well as 
with the King and his friends. 

The fears that the country had of the Catholic 
religion being restored, if the Duke of York should 
come to the throne, and the low cunning of the 
King in pretending to share their alarms, led to 
some very terrible results. A certain Dr. Tonge, 
a dull clergyman in the city , fell into the bands of 
a certain Titus Oates, a most infamous character 
who pretended to have acquired among the Jesuits 
abroad, a knowledge of a great plot for the murder 
of the King, and the re-establishment of the Ca- 
tholic religion. Titus Oates being produced by 
this unlucky Dr. Tonge and solemnly examined 
before the council, contradicted himself in a thou- 
sand ways , told the most ridiculous and improbable 
stories, and implicated Coleman, the Secretary of 
the Duchess of York. Now, although what be 
charged against Coleman was not true, and al- 
though you and I know very well that the real 
dangerous Catholic plot was that one with the 
King of France of which the Merry Monarch was

CHARLES THE SECOND* 301 

himself the head, there happened to be found among 
Coleman’s papers, some letters, in which he did 
praise the days of Bloody Queen Mary, and abuse 
Ihe Protestant religion* This was great good for- 
tune for Titus, as it seemed to confirm him; but 
better still was in store* Sir Edmundbury God- 
frey, the magistrate who had first examined him, 
being unexpectedly found dead near Primrose Hill, 
was confidently believed to have been killed by 
the Catholics. I think there is no doubt that he 
had been melancholy mad, and that he killed him- 
self; but he had a great Protestant funeral, and 
Titus was called the Saver of the Nation, and re- 
ceived a pension of twelve hundred pounds a year. 

As soon as Oates’s wickedness had met with 
this success, up started another villain, named Wil- 
liam Bedloe, who, attracted by a reward of five 
hundred pounds offered for the apprehension of 
the murderers of Godfrey, came forward and charged 
two Jesuits and some other persons with having 
committed it at the Queen’s desire. Oates , going 
into partnership with this new informer, had the 
audacity to accuse the poor Queen herself of high 
treason. Then appeared a third informer, as bad 
us either of the two , and accused a Catholic banker 
named Stayley of having said that the King was 
the greatest rogue in the world (which would not 
have been far from the truth), and that he would 
kill him with his own hand. This hanker, being 
at once tried and executed, Coleman and two others 
were tried and executed. Then, a miserable wretch 
named Prance, a Catholie silversmith, being ac-

cused by Bedloe, was tortured into confessing that 
he had taken part in Godfrey’s murder, and into 
accusing three other men of having committed it. 
Then, five Jesuits were accused by Oates, Bedloe, 
and Prance together, and were all found guilty, 
and executed on the same kind of contradictory 
and absurd evidence. The Queen’s physician and 
three monks were next put on their trial; but Oates 
and Bedloe had for the time gone far enough, and 
these four were acquitted. The public mind, how- 
ever, was so full of a Catholic plot, and so strong 
against the Duke of York, that James consented 
to obey a written order from his brother, and to go 
with his family to Brussels , provided that his rights 
should never be sacrificed in his absence to the 
Duke of Monmouth, the House of Commons, not 
satisfied with this, as the Bang hoped ,\ passed a 
bill to exclude the Duke from ever succeeding to 
the throne. In return, the King dissolved the Par- 
liament. He had deserted his old favorite, the 
Duke of Buckingham, who was now in the oppo- 
sition. 

To give any sufficient idea of the miseries of 
Scotland in this merry reign would occupy a hun- 
dred pages. Because the people would not have 
bishops, and were resolved to stand by their so- 
lemn League and Covenant* such cruelties were in- 
flicted upon them as make the blood run cold. Fero* 
cious dragoons galloped through the country to 
punish the peasants for deserting the churches; 
sons were hanged up at their fathers’ doors for re- 
fusing to disclose where their fathers were con-

cealed; wives were tortured to death for not be- 
traying their husbands; people were taken out of 
their fields and gardens and shot on the public 
roads without trial; lighted matches were tied to 
the fingers of prisoners, and a most horrible tor- 
ment called the Boot was invented, and constantly 
applied , which ground and mashed the victims’ legs 
with iron wedges. Witnesses were tortured as well 
as prisoners. All the prisons were full; all the 
gibbets were heavy with bodies; murder and plunder 
devastated the whole country. In spite of all, the 
Covenanters were by no means to be dragged into 
the churches, and persisted in worshipping God as 
they thought right. A body of ferocious High- 
Zanders , turned upon them from the mountains of 
their own country, had no greater effect than the 
English dragoons under Grahame op Claver- 
house, the most cruel and rapacious of all their 
enemies, whose name will ever be cursed through 
the length and breadth of Scotland. Archbishop 
Sharp had ever aided and abetted all these outrages.' 
But he fell at last; for, when the injuries of the 
Scottish people were at their height, he was seen, 
in his coach-and-six coming across a moor, by a 
body of men, headed by one John Balfour , who 
were waiting for another of their oppressors. Upon 
this they cried out that. Heaven had delivered him 
into their hands,' and killed him with many wounds.

bishop Sharp did.

the Scottish people on, that he might have an ex* 
cuse for a greater army than the v Parliament were 
willing to give him — sent down his son, the Duke 
of Monmouth, as commander-in-chief, with instruc- 
tions to attack the Scottish rebels, or Whigs as 
they were called, whenever he came up with than. 
Marching with ten thousand men from Edinburgh, 
he found them, in number four or five thousand, 
drawn up at Bothwell Bridge, by the Clyde. They 
were soon dispersed, and Monmouth showed a more 
humane character towards them than he had shown 
towards that Member of Parliament whose nose he 
had caused to be slit with a penknife. But the 
Duke of Lauderdale was their bitter foe, and sent 
Claverhouse to finish them. 

As the Duke of York became more and more 
unpopular, the Duke of Monmouth became more 
and more popular. It would have been decent in 
the latter not to have voted in favor of the renewed 
bill for the exclusion of James from the throne; 
hut he did so, much to the King’s amusement, who 
used to sit in the House of Lords by the fire, 
hearing the debates, which he said were as good 
as a play. The House of Commons passed the 
hill by ft large majority, and it was carried up to 
the House of Lords by Lord Bussell, one of the 
best of the leaders on the Protestant side. It was 
rejected there, chiefly because the bishops helped 
the King to get rid of it; and the fear of Catholic 
plots revived again. There had been another got 
up, by a fellow out of Newgate, named Dangeb- 
field, which is more famous than it deserves to

be, under the name of the Meal-Tub Plot. This 
jail-bird having been got out of Newgate by a Mbs. 
Cellder, a Catholic nurse, had turned Catholic 
himself, and pretended that he knew of a plot 
among the Presbyterians against the King’s life. 
This was very pleasant to the Duke of York, who 
hated the Presbyterians, who returned the compli- 
ment He gave Dangerfield twenty guineas, and 
sent him to the King his brother. But Dangerfield, 
breaking down altogether in his charge, and being 
sent back to Newgate, almost astonished the Duke 
out of his five senses by suddenly swearing that 
the Catholic nurse had put that false design into 
his head, and that what he really knew about, 
was, a Catholic plot against the King, the evidences 
of which would be found in some papers , concealed 
in a meal-tub in Mrs. Cellier’s house. There they 
were, of course, as he had put them there himself $ 
and so the tub gave the name to the plot. But, 
the nurse was acquitted on her trial, and it came 
to nothing. 

Lord Ashley, of the Cabal, was now Lord 
Shaftesbury, and was strong against the succession 
of the Duke of York. The House of Commons, 
aggravated to the utmost extent, as we may well 
suppose, by suspicions of the King’s conspiracy 
with the King of France, made a desperate point 
of the exclusion still, and were bitter against the 
Catholics generally. So unjustly bitter were they, 
I grieve to say, that they impeached the venerable 
Lord Stafford, a Catholic nobleman seventy years 
old, of a design to kill the King. The witnesses

were that atrocious Oates and two other birds of 
the same feather. He was found guilty on evi- 
dence quite as foolish as it was false, and was be- 
headed on Tower Hill. The people were opposed 
to him when he first appeared upon the scaffold, 
but, when he had addressed them and shown them 
how innocent he was, and how wickedly he was 
sent there, their better nature was aroused, and 
they said, 44 We believe you, my Lord. God bless 
you; my Lord!” 

The House of Commons refused to let the King 
have any money until he should consent to the Ex- 
clusion Bill; but, as he could get it and did get it 
from his master the King of France, he could afford 
to hold them very cheap. He called a Parliament 
at Oxford, to which he went down with a great 
show of being armed and protected as if he were 
in danger of his life, and to which the opposition 
members also went armed and protected, alleging 
that they were in fear of the Papists, who were 
numerous among the King's guards. However, they 
went on with the Exclusion Bill, and were so 
earnest upon it that they would have carried it 
again, if the King had not popped his crown and 
state robes into a sedan chair, bundled himself 
into it along with them , hurried down to the Chamber 
where the House of Lords met, and dissolved the 
Parliament After which he scampered home, and 
the Members of Parliament scampered home too, 
as fast as. their legs could carry them.

public trust, no right whatever to public employ- 
ment. Nevertheless, he was openly employed as 
the King’s representative in Scotland, and there 
gratified his sullen and cruel nature to his heart’s 
content by directing the dreadful cruelties against 
the Covenanters. There were two ministers named 
Cargill and Cameron, who had escaped from the 
battle of Bothwell Bridge, and who returned to 
Scotland and raised the miserable but still brave 
and unsubdued Covenanters afresh , under the name 
of Cameronians. As Cameron publicly posted a 
declaration that the King was a forsworn tyrant, 
no mercy was shown to his unhappy followers after 
he was slain in battle. The Duke of York, who 
was particularly fond of the Boot and derived great, 
pleasure from having it applied, offered their lives 
to some of these people, if they would cry on the 
scaffold u God save the King!” But their relations, 
Mends, and countrymen, had been so barbarously 
tortured and murdered in this merry reign, that 
they preferred to die, and did die. The Duke then 
obtained his merry brother’s permission to hold a 
Parliament in Scotland, which first, with most 
shameless deceit, confirmed the laws for securing 
the Protestant religion against Popery, and then 
declared that nothing must or should prevent the 
succession of the Popish Duke. After this double- 
faced beginning, it established an oath which no 
human being could understand, but which every- 
body was to take, as a proof that his religion was 
the lawful religion. The Earl of Argyle, taking 
it with the explanation that he did not consider it

to prevent him from favoring any alteration either 
in the Church or State, which was not inconsistent 
with the Protestant religion or with his loyalty, 
was tried for high treason before a Scottish jury 
of which the Mabquis of Montbosb was foreman, 
and was found guilty. He escaped the scaffold, 
for that time, by getting away, in the disguise of 
a page, in the train of his daughter, Lady Sophia 
Lindsay. It was absolutely proposed by certain 
members of the Scottish Council that this lady 
should be whipped through the streets of Edin- 
burgh. But this was too much even for the Duke, 
who had the manliness then (he had very little at 
most times) to remark that Englishmen were not 
accustomed to treat ladies in that manner. In those 
merry times nothing could equal the brutal servility 
of the Scottish fawners, but the conduct of similar 
degraded beings in England, 

After the settlement of these little affairs, the 
Duke returned to England and soon resumed his 
place at the Council, and his office of High Ad- 
miral — all this by his brother’s favor, and in open 
defiance of the law. It would have been no loss 
to the country if he had been drowned when his 
ship, in going to Scotland to fetch his family, 
struck on a sand-bank, and was lost with two hun- 
dred souls on board. But he escaped in a boat 
with some friends, and the sailors were so brave 
and unselfish that when they saw him rowing away, 
they gave three cheers, while they themselves were 
going down for ever. 

The Merry Monarch, having got rid of his Par-

liament, went to work to make Himself despotic 
with all speed. Having had the villany to order 
the execution of Oliver Plunket, Bishop op Ar- 
magh , falsely accused of a plot to establish Popery 
in that country by means of a French army — the 
very thing this royal traitor was himself trying to 
do at home — and having tried to ruin Lord 
Shaftesbury, and failed — he turned his hand to 
controlling the corporations all over the country $ 
because, if he could only do that, he could get 
what juries he chose, to bring in perjured verdicts, 
and could get what members he chose, returned to 
Parliament. These merry times produced and made 
Chief Justice of the Court of King’s Bench, a 
drunken ruffian of the name of Jeffreys; a red- 
faced, swollen, bloated, horrible creature, with a 
bullying roaring voice and a more savage nature, 
perhaps, than was ever lodged in any human 
breast. This monster was the Merry Monarch’s 
especial favorite, and he testified his admiration of 
him by giving him a ring from his own finger, 
which the people used to call, Judge Jeffrey’s 
Bloodstone. Him the King employed to go about 
and bully the corporations, beginning with Lon- 
don; or, as Jeffreys himself elegantly called it, 
“to give them a lick with the rough side of Ins 
tongue.” And he did it so thoroughly, that they 
soon became the basest and most sycophantic bodies 
in the kingdom — except the University of Ox- 
ford, which, in that respect, was quite pre-eminent 
and unapproachable.

failure against him), Lord William Bussell, the 
Duke of Monmouth, Lord Howard, Lord Jersey, 
Algernon Sidney, John Hampden (grandson, of 
‘‘the great Hampden), and some others, used to hold 
a council together after the dissolution of the Par- 
liament, arranging what it might be necessary to 
do, if the King carried his Popish plot to the ut- 
most height Lord Shaftesbury having been much 
the most violent of this party, brought two violent 
men into their secrets — Bumsey, who had been 
a soldier in the Bepublican army; and West, a 
lawyer. These two knew an old officer of Crom- 
well’s , called Bumbold , who had married a malt- 
ster’s widow, and so had come into possession of 
a solitary dwelling called the Bye House, near 
Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire. Bumbold said to 
them what a capital place this house, of his would 
be from which to shoot at the King, who often 
passed there going to and fro from Newmarket 
They liked the idea, and entertained it. But, one 
of their body gave information, and they, together 
with Shepherd a wine merchant, Lord Bussell, 
Algernon Sidney, Lord Essex, Lord Howard, 
and Hampden , were all arrested. 

Lord Bussell might have easily escaped but 
scorned to do so, being innocent of any wrong; 
Lord Essex might have easily escaped, but scorned 
to do so, lest his flight should prejudice Lord 
Bussell. But it weighed upon his mind that he had 
brought into their council Lord Howard, who now 
turned a miserable traitor, against a great dislike

not bear the reflection, and destroyed himself be- 
fore Lord Bussell was brought to trial at the Old 
Bailey. 

He knew very well that he had nothing to hope, 
having always been manful in the Protestant cause 
.against the two false brothers, the one on the 
throne, and the other standing next to it. He had 
a wife, one of the noblest and best of women, who 
acted as his secretary on his trial, who comforted 
him in his prison, who supped with him on the 
night before he died, and whose love and virtue 
and devotion have made her name imperishable. 
Of course, he was found guilty, and was sentenced 
to be beheaded in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, not many 
yards from his own house. When he had parted 
from his children on the evening before his death, 
his wife still stayed with him until ten o’clock at 
night; and when their final separation in this world 
was over, and he had kissed her many times, he 
still sat for a long while in his prison, talking of 
her goodness. Hearing the rain fall fast at that 
time, he calmly said, “Such a rain to-morrow will 
spoil a great show, which is a dull thing on a 
rainy day.” At midnight, he went to bed, and 
slept till four; even when his servant called him, 
he fell asleep again while his clothes were being 
made ready. He rode to the scaffold in his own 
carriage, attended by two famous clergymen, Til* 
lotson and Burnet, and sang a psalm to himself 
very softly, as he went along. He was as quiet 
and as steady, as if he had been going out for an 
ordinary ride. After saying that he was surprised

to see so great a crowd, lie laid down bis bead 
upon the block , as if it bad been the pillow of bis 
bed, and bad it struck off at the second blow. His 
noble wife was busy for him even then, for that 
true-hearted lady printed and widely circulated bis 
last words, of which he had given her a copy. 
They made the blood of all the honest men in 
England boil. 

The University of Oxford distinguished itself 
on the very same day by pretending to believe 
that the accusation against Lord Russell was true, 
and by calling the King, in a written paper, the 
Breath of their Nostrils and the Anointed of the 
Lord. This paper the Parliament afterwards caused 
to be burned by the common hangman, which I am 
sorry for, as I wish it had been framed and glazed 
and hung up in some public place, as a monument 
of baseness for the scorn of mankind. 

Next came the trial of Algernon Sidney, at 
which Jeffreys presided, like a great crimson toad, 
sweltering and swelling with rage. U I pray God, 
Mr. Sidney,” said this Chief Justice of a meny 
reign, after passing sentence, “to work in you a 
temper fit to go to the other world, for I see you 
are not fit for this.” “My lord,” said the prisoner, 
composedly holding out his arm, “feel my pulse, 
and see if I be disordered. I thank Heaven I 
never was in better temper than I am now.” Alger- 
non Sidney was executed on Tower Hill, on the 
seventh of December, one thousand six hundred 
and eighty three. He died a hero, and died, in 
his own words, “For that good old cause in which

he had been engaged from his youth , and for which 
God had so often and so wonderfully declared him- 
self.” 

The Duke of Monmonth had been making his 
uncle, the Duke of York, very jealous, by going 
about the country in a royal sort of way, playing 
at the people’s games, becoming godfather to their 
children, and even touching for the king’s evil, or 
stroking the faces of the sick to cure them — 
though, for the matter of that, I should say he did 
them about as much good as any crowned king 
could have done. His father had got him to write 
a letter, confessing his having had a part in the 
conspiracy, for which Lord Russell had been be- 
headed; but he was ever a weak man, and as soon 
as he had written it, he was ashamed of it, and 
got it back again. For this, he was banished to 
the Netherlands; but he soon returned and_had an 
interview with his father, unknown to his uncle. 
It would seem that he was coming into the Merry 
Monarch’s favor again , and that the Duke of York 
was sliding out of it, when Death appeared to the 
merry galleries at Whitehall, and astonished the 
debauched lords and gentlemen, and the shameless 
ladies , very considerably. 

On Monday, the second of February, one thou- 
sand six hundred and eighty-five, the merry pen- 
sioner and servant of the King of France fell down 
in a fit of apoplexy. By the Wednesday his case 
was hopeless , and on the Thursday he was told so. 
As he made a difficulty about taking the sacra- 
ment from the Protestant Bishop of Bath, the Duke

of York got all who were present away from the 
bed, and asked his brother, in a whisper, if he 
should send for a Catholic priest. The King re- 
plied, “For God’s sake, brother, do.” The Duke 
smuggled in, up the back stairs, disguised in. a 
wig and gown, a priest named Huddleston, who 
had saved the King’s life after the battle of Wor- 
cester: telling him that this worthy man in the wig 
had once saved his body, and was now come to 
save his soul. 

The Merry Monarch lived through that night, 
and died before noon on the next day, which was 
Friday, the sixth. Two of the last things he said 
were of a human sort, and your remembrance will 
give him the full benefit of them. When the Queen 
sent to say she was too unwell to attend him and 
to ask his pardon, he said, “Alas! poor woman, 
she beg my pardon! I beg hers with all my heart. 
Take back that answer to her.” And he also said, 
in reference to Nell Gwyn, “Do not let poor Nelly 
starve.” 

He died in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and 
the twenty-fith of his reign.

favored Ins brother Charles , as becoming, by com- 
parison, quite a pleasant character. The one ob- 
ject of bis short reign was to re-establish the Ca- 
tholic religion in England; and this he doggedly 
pursued with such a stupid obstinacy that his 
career very soon came to a close. 

The first thing he did, was, to assure, his council 
that he would make it his endeavour to preserve 
the Government, both in Church and State, as it 
was by law established; and that he would always 
take care to defend and support the Church. Great 
public acclamations were raised over this fair speech, 
and a great deal was said, from the public and 
elsewhere, about the word of a King which was 
never broken, by credulous people who little sup- 
posed that he had formed a secret council for Ca- 
tholic affairs, of which a mischievous Jesuit, called 
Father Petbb, was one of the chief members 
With tears of joy in his eyes , he received as the 
beginning of his pension from the King of France 
five hundred thousand livres; yet, with a mixture 
of meanness and arrogance that belonged to his 
contemptible character, he was always jealous of 
making some show of being independent of the 
King of France, while he pocketed his money. As 
• — notwithstanding his publishing two papers in 
favor of Popeiy (and not likely to do it much ser- 
vice, I should think) written by the King, his 
brother, and found in his strongbox; and his open

ment was very obsequious, and granted him a large 
sum of money, he began his reign with a belief

that he could do what he pleased, and with a de- 
termination to do it. 

Before we proceed to its principal events, let 
ns dispose of Titus Oates. He was tried for per- 
jury a fortnight after the coronation, and besides 
being very heavily fined, was sentenced to stand 
twice in the pillory, to be whipped from Aldgate 
to Newgate one day, and from Newgate to Tyburn 
two days afterwards, and to stand in the pillory 
five times a year as long as he lived. This fearful 
sentence was actually inflicted on the rascal. Being 
unable to stand after his first flogging, he was 
dragged on a sledge from Newgate to Tyburn, and 
flogged as he was drawn along. He was so strong 
a villain that he did not die under the torture, but 
lived to be afterwards pardoned and rewarded, 
though not to be ever believed in any more. Danger- 
field, the only other one of that crew left alive, 
was not so fortunate. He was almost killed by a 
whipping from Newgate to Tyburn, and, as if that 
were not punishment enough, a ferocious barrister 
of Gray’s Inn gave him a poke in the eye with 
his cane, which caused his death; for which the 
ferocious barrister was deservedly tried and exe- 
cuted. 

As soon as James was on the throne, Argyle 
and Monmouth went from Brussels to Rotterdam, 
and attended a meeting of Scottish exiles held there, 
to concert measures for a rising in England. It 
was agreed that Argyle should effect a landing in 
Scotland, and Monmouth in England, and that two 
Englishmen should be sent with Argyle to be in

his confidence, and two Scotchmen with the Duke 
of Monmouth. 

Argyle was the first to act upon this contract. 
But, two of his men being taken prisoners at the 
Orkney Islands, the Government became aware of 
his intentions, and was able to act against him 
with such vigour as to prevent his raising more 
than two or three thousand Highlanders, although 
he sent a fiery cross, by trusty messengers, from 
clan to clan and from glen to glen, as the custom 
then was when those wild people were to he ex- 
cited by their chiefs. As he was moving towards 
Glasgow with his small force, he was betrayed by 
some of his followers, taken, and carried, with his 
hands tied behind his back, to his old prison in 
Edinburgh Castle. James ordered him to be exe- 
cuted, on his old shamefully unjust sentence, within 
three days, and appears to have been anxious that 
his legs should have been pounded with his old 
favorite the boot. However, the boot was not ap- 
plied; he was simply beheaded, and his head was 
set upon the top of Edinburgh Jail. One of those 
Englishmen who had been assigned to him was 
that old soldier Rumbold, the master of the Bye 
House. He was sorely wounded, and within a 
week after Argyle had suffered with great courage, 
was brought up for trial, lest he should die and 
disappoint the King. He, too, was executed, after 
defending himself with great spirit, and saying 
that he did not .believe that God had made the 
greater part of mankind to carry saddles on their 
backs and bridles in their mouths , and to be ridden*

by a few, booted and spurred for the purpose — 
in which I thoroughly agree with Rumbold. 

The Duke of Monmouth, partly through being 
detained and partly through idling his time away, 
was five or six weeks behind his friend when be 
landed at Lyme, in Dorset: having at Ins right 
hand an unlucky nobleman called Lord Grey or 
Were, who of himself would have ruined a far 
more promising expedition. He immediately Bet up 
his standard in the market-place, and proclaimed 
the Tting a tyrant, and a Popish usurper r and I 
know- not what else; charging him, not only with 
what he had done, which was bad enough, but 
with what neither he nor anybody else had done, 
such as setting fire to London, and poisoning the 
late King. Raising some four thousand men by 
these means, he marched on to Taunton, where 
there were many Protestant dissenters who were 
strongly opposed to the Catholics. Here, both the 
rich and poor turned out to receive him, ladies 
waved a welcome to him from all the windows as 
he passed along the streets, flowers were strewn in 
his way, and every compliment and honor that 
could be devised was showered upon him. -Among 
the rest, twenty young ladies came forward, ®

at finding that ho made but few powerful friends 
after all, that it was a question whether he should 
disband his army and endeavour to escape. It was 
resolved, at the instance of that unlucky Lord Grey, 
to make a night attack on the King’s army, as it 
lay encamped on the edge of a morass called Sedge- 
moor. The horseinen were commanded by the same 
unlucky lord, who was not a brave man. He gave 
up the battle almost at the first obstacle — which 
was a deep drain; and although the poor country- 
men, who had turned out for Monmouth, fought 
bravely with scythes, poles, pitchforks, and such 
poor weapons as they had, they were soon dis- 
persed by the trained soldiers, and fled in all di- 
rections. When the Duke of Monmouth himself 
fled, was not known in the confusion; but the un- 
lucky lord was taken early. next day, and then an- 
other of the party was taken, who confessed that 
he had parted from the Duke only four hours be- 
fore. Strict search being made, he was found dis- 
guised as a peasant, hidden in a ditch under fern 
and nettles, with a few peas in his pocket which 
he had gathered in the fields to eat. The only 
other articles he had upon him were a few papers 
and little books; one of the latter being a strange 
jumble, in his own writing, of charms, songs, re- 
cipes, and prayers. He was completely broken. 
He wrote a miserable letter to the King, beseeching* 
and entreating to be allowed to see him. When 
he was taken to London, and conveyed bound into 
the King’s presence, he crawled to him on his 
knees, and made a most degrading exhibition. As

James never forgave or relented towards any body 
lie was not likely to soften towards the issuer of 
the Lyme proclamation, so he told the suppliant to 
prepare for death. 

On the fifteenth of July, one thousand six hun- 
dred and eighty-five, this unfortunate favorite of 
the people was brought out to die on Tower H31. 
The crowd was immense, and the tops of all the 
houses were covered with gazers. He had seen his 
wife, the daughter of the Duke of Buccleuch, in 
the Tower, and had talked much of a lady whom 
he loved far better — the Lady Harriet Went- 
worth — who was one of the last persons he re- 
membered in this life. Before laying down his 
head upon the block he felt the edge of the axe, 
and told the executioner that he feared it was not 
sharp enough, and that the axe was not heavy 
enough. On the executioner replying that it was 
of the proper kind, the Duke said, “I pray you 
have a care, and do not use me so awkwardly as 
you used my Lord Russell.” The executioner, 
made nervous by this, and trembling, struck once 
and merely gashed him in the neck. Upon this 
the Duke of Monmouth raised his head and looked 
the man reproachfully in the face. Then he struck 
twice, and then thrice, and then threw down the 
axe, and cried out in a voice of horror, that he 
could not finish that work. The, sheriffs, however, 
threatening him with what should be done to him- 
self if he did not, he took it up again and struck 
a fourth time and a fifth time. Then the wretched 
head at last fell off, and James, Duke of Mon*

mouth, was dead, in the thirty-sixth year of his 
age. He was a showy, graceful man, with many 
popular qualities, and had found much favor in 
the open hearts of the English. 

The atrocities committed by the Government 
which followed this Monmouth rebellion, form the 
blackest and most lamentable page in English his- 
tory. The poor peasants, having been dispersed 
with great loss, and their leaders having been 
taken, one would think that the implacable King 
might have been satisfied. But no; he let loose 
upon them, among other' intolerable monsters, a 
Colonel Kirk, who had served against the Moors, 
and whose soldiers — called by the people Kirks 
lambs, because they bore a lamb upon their flag, 
as the emblem of Christianity — were worthy of 
their leader. The atrocities committed by these 
demons in human shape are far too horrible to be 
related here. It is enough to say, that besides 
most ruthlessly murdering and robbing them, and 
ruining them by making them buy their pardons 
at the price of all they possessed, it was one of 
Kirks favorite amusements, as he and his offi- 
cers sat drinking after dinner, and toasting the 
Bang, to have batches of prisoners hanged outside 
the windows for the company’s diversion; and that 
when their feet quivered in the convulsions of 
death, he used to swear that they should have 
music to their dancing, and would order the drums 
to beat and the trumpets to play. The detestable 
King informed him, as an acknowledgment of these 
services, that he was “very well satisfied with his

proceedings.” But the King’s great delight, was 
in the proceeding* of Jeffreys, now a peer, who 
went down into the west, with four other judges 
to try persons accused of having had any share in 
the rebellion. The King pleasantly called this 
“ Jefifreys’s campaign.” The people down in that 
part of the country remember it to this hour as 
The Bloody Assize. 

It began at Winchester , where a poor deaf old 
lady, Mbs. Alicia Lisle, the widow of one of the 
judges of Charles the First (who had been murder- 
ed abroad by some loyalist assassins), was charged 
with having given shelter in her house to two fu- 
gitives from Sedgemoor. Three times the jury re- 
fused to find her guilty, until Jeffreys bulbed and 
frightened them into that false verdict. When he 
had extorted it from them, he said, “ Gentlemen, 
if I had been one of you , and she had been my 
own mother, I would have found her guilty;” — 
as I dare say he would. He sentenced her to be 
burned alive that very afternoon. The clergy of 
the cathedral and some others interfered in her favor, 
and she was beheaded within a week. As a high 
mark of his approbation, the King made Jeffreys 
Lord Chancellor; and he then went on to Dorchester, 
to Eseter, to Taunton, and to Wells. It is astonish- 
ing, when we read of the enormous injustice and 
barbarity of this beast, to know that no one struck 
him dead on the judgment seat It was enough 
for any man or woman to be accused by an enemy, 
before Jeffreys , to be found guilty of high treason. 
One man who pleaded not guilty, he ordered to be

taken out of court upon the instant, and hanged; 
and this so terrified the prisoners in general that 
they mostly pleaded guilty at once. At Dorchester 
alone , in the course of a few days , Jeffreys hanged 
eighty people, besides whipping, transporting, fin- 
prisoning, and selling as slaves, great numbers. 
He executed in all two hundred and fifty or three 
hundred. 

These executions took place, among the neigh- 
bours and friends of the sentenced, in thirty-six 
towns and villages. Their bodies were mangled, 
steeped in caldrons of boiling pitch and tar, and 
hung up by the road aides , in the streets , over the 
very churches. The sight and smell of heads and 
limbs, the hissing and bubbling of the infernal 
caldrons, and the tears and terrors of the people, 
were dreadful beyond all description. One rustic, 
who was forced to steep the remains in the black 
pot, was ever afterwards called “Tom J3 oilman.” 
The hangman has ever since been called Jack 
Ketch, because a man of that name went hanging 
and hanging, all day long, in the train of Jeffreys. 
You will hear much of the horrors of the great 
French Revolution. Many and terrible they were, 
there is no doubt; but I know of nothing worse, 
done by the maddened people of France in that 
awful time, than was done by the highest judge in 
England, with the express approval of the King of 
England, in The Bloody Assize. 

Nor was even this all. Jeffreys was as fond of 
money for himself as of misery for others, and he 
sold pardons wholesale to fill his pockets. The

King ordered, at one time, a thousand prisoners to 
be given to certain of his favorites , in order that 
they might bargain with them for their pardons. 
Those young ladies of Taunton who had presented 
the Bible, were bestowed upon the maids of honor 
at court; and those precious ladies made very hard 
bargains with them indeed — employing a Quaker 
to drive the said bargains. When The Bloody 
Assize was at its most dismal height, the King was 
diverting himself with horse-races in the very place 
where Mrs. Lisle had been executed. When Jeff- 
reys had done his worst, and came home again, he 
was particularly complimented in the Royal Ga- 
zette ; and when theKing heard that through drunken- 
ness and raging he was very ill, his odious .Ma- 
jesty remarked that such another man could not 
easily be found in England. Besides all this, a 
former sheriff of London, named Cornish, was 
hanged within sight of his own house, after an 
abominably conducted trial; for having had a share 
in the Rye House Plot , on evidence given by 
Rumsey, which that villain was obliged to confess 
was directly opposed to the evidence he had given 
on the trial of Lord Russell. And on the very 
same day, a worthy widow,, named Elizabeth 
Gaunt, was burned alive at Tyburn, for having 
sheltered a wretch who himself gave evidence against 
her. She settled the fuel about her with her own 
hands, so that the flames should reach her quickly; 
and nobly said, with her last breath, that she had 
obeyed the sacred command of God, to give refuge 
to the outcast, and not to betray the wanderer.

After all this hanging, beheading, buming r 
boiling, mutilating, exposing, robbing, transport- 
ing, and selling into slavery, of his unhappy sub- 
jects , the King not • unnaturally thought that he 
could do whatever he would. So, he went to work 
to change the religion of the country with all pos- 
sible speed; and what he did was this. 

He first of all tried to get rid of what was 
called the Test Act, which prevented the Catholics 
from holding public employments , by his own power 
of dispensing with the penalties. He tried it in 
one case, and eleven of the twelve judges deciding 
in his favor he exercised it in three others, being 
those of three dignitaries of University College, 
Oxford, who had become Papists (which such people 
never do now , I believe) and whom he kept in 
their places and sanctioned. He revived the hated 
Ecclesiastical Commission, to get rid of Compton, 
Bishop of London, who manfully opposed him. He 
solicited the Pope to favor England with an am- 
bassador, which the Pope (who was a sensible man 
then) rather unwillingly did. He flourished Father 
Petre before the eyes of the people on all possible 
occasions. He favored the establishment of con- 
vents in several parts of London. He was delight- 
ed to have the streets, and even the court itself, 
filled with Monks and Friars in the habits of their 
orders. He constantly endeavoured to make Ca- 
tholics of the Protestants about him. He held pri- 
vate interviews, which he called 44 closetings ,” with 
those Members of Parliament who held offices, to 
persuade . them to consent to the design he had in

view. When they did not consent, they were re- 
moved, or resigned Of themselves, and their places 
were given to Catholics. He displaced Protestant 
officers from the army by every means in his power, 
and got Catholics into their places too. He tried 
the same thing with corporations, and also (though 
not so successfully) with the Lord Lieutenants of 
counties. To terrify the people into the endurance 
of all these measures, he kept an army of fifteen 
thousand men, encamped on Hounslow Heath, where 
mass was openly performed in the General's tent, 
and where priests went among the soldiers endea- 
vouring to persuade them to become Catholics. For 
circulating a paper among those men advising them 
to be true to their religion, a Protestant clergyman, 
named Johnson, the chaplain of the late Lord 
Bussell, was actually sentenced to stand three times 
in the pillory, and was actually whipped from New- 
gate to Tyburn. He dismissed his own brother-in- 
law from his Council because he was a Protestant, 
and made a Privy Councillor of the before-men- 
tioned Father Petre. He handed Ireland over to 
Bichabd Talbot, Earl of Tyhconnell , a worth- 
less, dissolute knave, who played the same game 
there for his master, and who played the deeper 
game for himself of one day putting it under the 
protection of the French King. In going to these 
extremities, every man of sense and judgment 
among the Catholics, from the Pope to a porter, 
knew that the King was a mere bigoted fool, who 
would undo himself and the cause he sought to ad- 
vance} but he was deaf to all reason, and, happily

for England ever afterwards , went tumbling off bis 
throne in bis own blind way. 

A spirit began to arise in the country, which 
the besotted blunderer little expected. He first 
found it out in the University of Cambridge. Ha- 
ving made a Catholic, a dean, at Oxford, without 
any opposition, he tried to make a monk a master 
of arts at Cambridge: which attempt the University 
resisted and defeated him. He then went back to 
his favorite Oxford. On the death of the President 
of Magdalen College, he commanded that there 
should be elected to succeed him one Mr. Anthony 
Farmer, whose only recommendation was, that he 
was of the King’s religion. The University plucked 
up courage at last, and refused. The King sub- 
stituted another man, and it still refused, resolving 
to stand by its own election of a Mr. Hough. The 
dull tyrant, upon this, punished Mr. Hough and 
five-and-twenty more, by causing them to be ex- 
pelled and declared incapable of holding any church 
preferment; then he proceeded to what he supposed 
to be his highest step, but to what was, in fact, 
the last plunge head foremost in his tumble off his 
throne. 

He had issued a declaration that there should 
be no religious tests or penal laws, in older to let 
in the Catholics more easily; but the Protestant 
dissenters, unmindful of themselves, had gallantly 
joined the regular church in opposing it tooth and 
nail. The King and Father Petre now resolved 
to have this read, on a certain Sunday, in all the 
churches, and to order it to be circulated for that

purpose by the bishops. The latter took council 
with the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in 
disgrace; and they resolved that the declaration 
should not be read, and that they would petition 
the King against it. The Archbishop himself wrote 
out the petition, and six bishops went into the 
King.’s bed-chamber the same night to present it, 
to his infinite astonishment. Next day was the 
Sunday fixed for the reading , and it was only read 
by two hundred clergymen out of ten thousand* 
The King resolved against all advice to prosecute 
the bishops in the Court of King’s Bench, and 
within three weeks they were summoned before the 
Privy Council and committed to the Tower. As 
the six bishops were taken to that dismal place, by 
water, the people who were assembled in immense 
numbers fell upon their knees, and wept for them, 
and prayed for them. When they got to the Tower, 
the officers and soldiers on guard besought them 
for their blessing. While they were confined there, 
the soldiers every day drank to their release with 
loud shouts. When they were brought up to the 
Court of King’s Bench for their trial, which the 
Attorney-General said was for the high offence of 
censuring the Government, and giving their opinion 
about affairs of state, they were attended by si- 
milar multitudes, and surrounded by a throng of 
noblemen and gentlemen. When the jury went 
out at seven o’clock at night to consider of their 
verdict, everybody (except the King) knew that 
they would rather starve than yield to the Kang’s 
brewer, who was one of them, and wanted a ver-

diet for his customer. When they came into court 
next morning, after resisting the brewer all night, 
and gave a verdict of not guilty, such a shout rose 
up in Westminster Hall as it had never heard be- 
fore; and it was passed on among the people away 
to Temple Bar, and away again to the Tower. It 
did not pass only to the east, but passed to the 
west too, until it reached the camp at Hounslow, 
where the fifteen thousand soldiers took it up and 
echoed it. And still, when the dull King, who 
was then with Lord Feversham, heard the mighty 
roar, asked in alarm what it was, and was told 
that it was “nothing but the acquittal of the bi- 
shops,” he said, in his dogged way, “Call you 
that nothing? It is so much the worse for them.” 

Between the petition and the trial, the Queen 
had given birth to a son, which Father Petre rather 
thought was owing to Saint Winifred. But I doubt 
if Saint Winifred had much to do with it as the 
King’s friend, inasmuch as the entirely new pro- 
spect of a Catholic successor (for both the King’s 
daughters were Protestants), determined the Earls 
op Shrewsbury, Danby, and Devonshire, Lord 
Lumley, the Bishop op London, Admiral Bus- 
bell, and Colonel Sidney to invite the Prince of 
Orange over to England. The Boyal Mole, seeing 
his danger at last, made, in his fright, many great 
concessions, besides raising an army of forty thou- 
sand men; but the Prince of Orange was not a 
man for James the Second to cope with; his pre- 
parations were extraordinarily vigorous; and his 
mind was resolved.

For a fortnight after the Prince was ready to 
sail for England, a great wind from the west pre- 
vented the departure of his fleet. Even when the 
wind lulled, and it did sail, it was dispersed by a 
storm, and was obliged to put back to refit. At 
last,. on the first of November, one thousand six 
hundred and eighty-eight, the Protestant east wind, 
as it was long called, began to Mow; and on the 
third, the people of Dover and the people of Calais 
saw a fleet twenty miles long sailing gallantly by, 
between the two places. On Monday, the fifth, it 
anchored at Torbay in Devonshire, and the Prince, 
with a splendid retinue of officers and men, marched 
into Exeter. But the people in that western part 
of the country had suffered so mueh in The Bloody 
Assize, that they had lost heart. Few people joined 
him, and he began to think of returning, and pub- 
lishing the invitation he had received from those 
lords, as his justification for having come at alL 
At this crisis, some of the gentry joined him; the 
Royal army began to falter; an engagement was 
signed, by which all who set their hand to it, de- 
clared that they would support one another in de- 
fence of the laws and liberties of the three King- 
doms, of the Protestant religion, and of the Prince 
of Orange. From that time, the cause received no ✓ 
cheek; the greatest towns in England began, one 
after another, to declare for the Prince; and he 
knew that it was all safe with him when the Uni- 
versity of Oxford offered to melt down its plate if 
he wanted any money. 

By this time the King was running about in a

pitiable way, touching people for the King's evil 
in one place, reviewing his troops in another, and 
bleeding from the nose in a third. The young 
Prince was sent to Portsmouth, Father Petre went 
off like a shot to France, and there was a general 
and swiff dispersal of all the priests and friars. 
One after another, the King's most important offi- 
cers and friends deserted him and went over to the 
Prince. In the night, his daughter Anne fled from 
Whitehall Palace; and the Bishop of London, who 
had once been a soldier, rode before her with a 
drawn sword in his hand and pistols at his saddle. 
“God help me, 1 ' cried the miserable King: “my 
very children have forsaken me!” In his wildness, 
after debating with such lords as were in London, 
whether he should or should not call a Parliament, 
and after naming three of them to negotiate with 
the Prince, he resolved to fly to France. He had 
the little Prince of Wales brought back from Ports- 
mouth; and the child and the Queen crossed the 
river to Lambeth in an open boat, on a miserable 
wet night, and got safely away. This was on 
the night of the ninth of December. 

At one o'clock on the morning of the eleventh, 
the King, who had, in the meantime, received a 
letter from the Prince of Orange, stating his ob- 
jects, got out of bed, told Lord Northumberland 
who lay in his room not to open the door until the 
usual hour in the morning, and went down the 
bad: stairs (the same, I suppose, by whieh the 
priest in the wig and gown had come up to his 
brother), and crossed the river in a small boat:

sinking the great seal by the way. Horses haying 
been provided, he rode, accompanied by Sir Ed- 
ward Hales, to Feversham, where he embarked 
in a Custom House Hoy. The Master of this Hoy ? 
wanting more ballast, ran into the Isle of Sheppy 
to get it, where the fishermen and smugglers crowded 
about the boat, and informed the King of their 
suspicions that he was a “hatchet-faced Jesuit” 
As they took his money and would not let him go, 
he told them who he was, and that the Prince of 
Orange wanted to take his life ; and began to scream 
for a boat; and then to cry, because he had lost a 
piece of wood on his ride which he called a frag- 
ment of our Saviour’s cross. He put himself into 
the hands of the Lord Lieutenant of the county, 
and his detention was made known to the Prince 
of Orange at Windsor — who, only wanting to 
get rid of him, and not caring where he went, so 
that he went away, was very much disconcerted 
that they did not let him go. However, there was 
nothing for it but to have him brought back, with 
some state in the way of Life Guards, to White- 
hall. And as soon as he got there, in his infa- 
tuation, he heard mass, and set a Jesuit to say 
grace at hiq public dinner. 

The people had been thrown into the strangest 
state of confusion by his flight, and had taken it 
into their heads that the Irish part of the army 
were going to murder the Protestants. Therefore, 
they set the bells ringing, and lighted watch-fires, 
and burned Catholic Chapels , and looked about in 
all directions for Father Petre and the Jesuits,

while the Pope’s ambassador was running away in 
the dress of a footman. They found no Jesuits; 
but a man, who had once been a frightened witness 
before Jeffreys in court, saw a swollen, drunken 
face, looking through a window down at Wapping, 
which he well remembered. The face was in a 
sailor’s dress,* but he knew it to be the face of that 
accursed Judge, and he seized him. The people, 
to their lasting honor, did not tear him to pieces. 
After knocking him about a little, they took him, 
in the basest agonies of terror, to the Lord Mayor, 
who sent him, at his own shrieking petitions, to 
the Tower for safety. There, he died. 

Their bewilderment continuing, the people now 
lighted bonfires and made rejoicings, as if they 
had any reason to be glad to have the King back 
again. But, his stay was very short, for the Eng- 
lish guards were removed from Whitehall, Dutch 
guards were marched up to it, and he was told by 
one of his late ministers that the Prince would 
enter London next day and he had better go to 
Ham. He said, Ham was a cold damp place, and 
he would rather go to Rochester. He thought him- 
self very cunning in this, as he meant to escape 
from Rochester to France. The Prince of Orange 
and his friends knew that, perfectly well, and de- 
sired nothing more. So, he went to Gravesend, 
in his royal barge, attended by certain lords, and 
watched by Dutch troops, and pitied by the ge- 
nerous people, who were far more forgiving than 
he had ever been, when they saw him in his hu- 
• miliation. On the night of the twenty-third of De~

cember , not even then understanding that every- 
body wanted to get rid of him, he went out, ab- 
surdly, through his Rochester garden, down to the 
Medway, and got away to France where he re- 
joined the Queen. 

There had been a council in his absence, of 
the lords, and the authorities of London. When 
the Prince came, on the day after the King’s de- 
parture, he summoned the Lords to meet him, and 
soon afterwards, all those who had served in any 
of the Parliaments of King Charles the Second. It 
was finally resolved by these authorities that the 
throne was vacant by the conduct of King Janies 
the Second , that it was inconsistent with the safety 
and welfare of this Protestant kingdom to be go- 
verned by a Popish prince, that the Prince and 
Princess of Orange should be King and Queen 
during their lives and the life of the survivor of 
them, and that their children should succeed them 
if they had any. That if they had none, the Prin- 
cess Anne and her children should succeed; and if 
she had none, the heirs of the Prince of Orange. 

On the thirteenth of January, one thousand six 
hundred and eighty nine , the Prince and Princess, 
sitting on a throne in Whitehall, bound themselves 
to these conditions. The Protestant religion was 
established in England, and England’s great and 
glorious Revolution was complete.

WILLIAM THE THIRD* 


335 


CHAPTER XLV. 

ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE THIRD. 

I have now arrived at the close of my little 
history. The events which succeeded the famous 
Revolution of one thousand six hundred and eighty- 
eight, would neither be easily related nor easily 
understood in such a book as this. 

William and Mary reigned together, five years. 
After the death of his good wife, William occupied 
the throne, alone, for seven years longer. During 
his reign , on the sixteenth of September , one thou- 
sand seven hundred and one, the poor weak crea- 
ture who had once been James the Second of Eng- 
land, died in France. In the meantime he had 
done his utmost (which was not much) to cause 
William to be assassinated, and to regain his lost 
dominions. James’s son was^ declared, by the French 
King, the rightful King of England, and was called 
in France The Chevalier Saint George, and in 
England The Pretender* Some infatuated people 
in England, and particularly in Scotland, took up 
the Pretender’s cause horn time to time — as if 
the country had not, to its cost, had Stuarts enoughl 
— and many lives were sacrificed, and much misery 
occasioned. King William died on Sunday, the 
seventh of March., one thousand seven hundred and 
two, of the consequences of an accident occasioned

by his hors© stumbling with him* He was always 
a' brave patriotic Prince, and a man of remarkable 
abilities. His manner was cold, and he made but 
few friends; but he had truly loved his queen. 
When he was dead, a lock of her hair, in a ring, 
was found tied with a black ribbon round his left 
arm. 

He was succeeded by the Princess Anne, a po- 
pular Queen, who reigned twelve years. In her 
reign, in the month of May, one thousand seven 
hundred and seven, the Union between .England 
and Scotland was effected, and the two countries 
were incorporated under the name of Great 
Britain. Then, from the year one thousand 
seven hundred and fourteen to the year one thou- 
sand eight hundred and thirty, reigned the four 
Georges. 

It was in the reign of George the Second, in 
the year one thousand seven hundred and forty- 
five, that the Pretender did his last mischief, and 
made his last appearance. Being an old man by 
that time, he and the Jacobites — as his friends 
were called — put forward his son, Charles Ed- 
ward, known as the Young Chevalier. The High- 
landers of Scotland, an extremely troublesome and 
wrong-headed race on the subject of the Stuarts, 
espoused his cause, and he joined them, and there 
was a Scottish rebellion to make him king, m 
which many gallant and devoted gentlemen lost 
their lives. It was a hard matter for Charles Ed- 
ward to escape abroad again, with a high price on 
his head; but the Scottish people were extraordi-

narily faithful to him, and, after undergoing many 
romantic adventures, not unlike those of Charles 
the Second, he escaped to France. A number of 
charming stories and delightful songs arose out of 
the Jacobite feelings, and belong to the Jacobite 
times. Otherwise, I think the Stuarts were a public 
nuisance altogether. 

It was in the reign of George the Third, that 
England lost North America, by persisting in 
taxing her without her own consent. That im- 
mense country, made independent under Wash- 
ington , and left to itself, became the United 
States; one of the greatest nations of the earth. 
In these times in which I write, it is honorably re- 
markable for protecting its subjects, wherever they 
may travel, with a dignity and a determination 
which is a model for England. Between you and 
me, England has rather lost ground in this respect 
since the days of Oliver Cromwell. 

The Union of Great Britain with Ireland — 
which had been getting on very badly by itself — 
took place in the reign of George the Third, on 
the second of July, one thousand seven hundred 
and ninety-eight 

William the fourth succeeded George the 
Fourth in the year one thousand eight hundred 
and thirty, and reigned seven years. Queen Vic- 
toria, his niece, the only child of the Duke of 
Kent, the fourth son of George the Third, came 
to the throne on the twentieth of June, one thou- 
sand eight hundred and thirty -seven. She was 
married to Prince Albert of Saxe Gotha on the
