CHAPTER XXYI. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SEVENTH. 

King Henry the Seventh did not turn out to be as 
fine a fellow as the nobility and people hoped, in the 
first joy of their deliverance from Richard the Third. 
He was very cold, crafty, and calculating, and would 
do almost anything for money. He possessed con- 
siderable ability, hut his chief merit appears to have 
been that he was not cruel when there was nothing 
to be got by it. 

The new King had promised the nobles who had 
espoused his cause that he would marry the princess 
Elizabeth. The first thing he did, was, to direct her 
to be removed from the castle of Sheriff Hutton in 

Yorkshire where Richard had placed her, and restored

to the care of her mother in London. The young Earl 
of Warwick, Edward Plantagenet, son and heir of the 
late Duke of Clarence, had been kept a prisoner in 
this same old Yorkshire castle with her. This boy, 
who was now fifteen, the new King placed in the Tower 
for safety. Then he came to London in great state, 
and gratified the people with a fine procession; on 
which kind of show he often very much relied for 
keeping them in good humour. The sports and feasts 
which took place were followed by a terrible fever, 
called the Sweating Sickness ; of which great numbers 
of people died. Lord Mayors and Aldermen are thought 
to have suffered most from it ; whether, because they 
were in the habit of over-eating themselves, or because 
they were very jealous of preserving filth and nuisances 
in the city (as they have been since), I don’t know. 

The King’s coronation was postponed on account of 
the general ill-health, and he afterwards deferred his 
marriage, as if he were not very anxious that it should 
take place : and, even after that, deferred the Queen’s 
coronation so long that he gave offence to the York 
party. However, he set these things right in the end, 
by hanging some men and seizing on the rich pos- 
sessions of others ; by granting more popular pardons 
to the followers of the late King than could, at first,

be got from him ; and, by employing about his Court, 
some not very scrupulous persons who had been em- 
ployed in the previous reign. 

As this reign was principally remarkable for two very 
curious impostures which have become famous in his- 
tory, we will make those two stories its principal 
feature. 

There was a priest at Oxford of the name of Simons, 
who had for a pupil a handsome boy named Lambert 
Simnel, the son of a baker. Partly to gratify his 
own ambitious ends, and partly to carry out the de- 
signs of a secret party formed against the King, this 
priest declared that his pupil, the boy, was no other 
than the young Earl of Warwick ; who (as everybody 
might have known) was safely locked up in the Tower 
of London. The priest and the boy went over to 
Ireland ; and, at Dublin, enlisted in their cause all ranks 
of the people : who seem to have been generous enough, 
but exceedingly irrational. The Earl of Kildare, the 
governor of Ireland, declared that he believed the boy 
to be what the priest represented ; and the boy, who 
had been well tutored by the priest, told them such 
things of his childhood, and gave them so many 
descriptions of the Koyal Family, that they were 
perpetually shouting and hurrahing, and drinking his

health, and making all kinds of noisy and thirsty 
demonstrations, to express their belief in him. Nor 
was this feeling confined to Ireland alone, for the Earl 
of Lincoln — whom the late usurper had named as his 
successor — went over to the young Pretender ; and, after 
holding a secret correspondence with the Dowager 
Duchess of Burgundy — the sister of Edward the Fourth, 
who detested the present King and all his race — sailed 
to Dublin with two thousand German soldiers of her 
providing. In this promising state of the boy’s for- 
tunes, he was crowned there, with a crown taken off 
the head of a statue of the Virgin Mary ; and was then, 
according to the Irish custom of those days, carried 
home on the shoulders of a big chieftain possessing a 
great deal more strength than sense. Father Simons, 
you may be sure, was mighty busy at the coronation. 

Ten days afterwards, the Germans, and the Irish, 
and the priest, and the boy, and the Earl of Lincoln, 
all landed in Lancashire to invade England. The 
Kin g, who had good intelligence of their movements, 
set up his standard at Nottingham, where vast numbers 
resorted to him every day ; while the Earl of Lincoln 
could gain but very few. With his small force he 
tried to make for the town of Newark ; but the King’s 
army getting between him and that place, he had no

choice but to risk a battle at Stoke. It soon ended in 
the complete destruction of the Pretender’s forces, 
one half of whom were killed ; among them, the Earl 
himself. The priest and the baker’s boy were taken 
prisoners. The priest, after confessing the trick, was 
shut up in prison, where he afterwards died — suddenly 
perhaps. The boy was taken into the King’s kitchen 
and made a turnspit. He was afterwards raised to the 
station of one of the King’s falconers ; and so ended 
this strange imposition. 

There seems reason to suspect that the Dowager 
Queen — always a restless and busy woman — had had 
some share in tutoring the baker’s son. The King 
was very angry with her, whether or no. He seized 
upon her property, and shut her up in a convent at 
Bermondsey. 

One might suppose that the end of this story would 
have put the Irish people on their guard; but they 
were quite ready to receive a second impostor, as they 
had received the first, and that same troublesome 
Duchess of Burgundy soon gave them the opportunity. 
All of a sudden there appeared at Cork, in a vessel 
arriving from Portugal, a young man of excellent 
abilities, of very handsome appearance and most win- 
ning manners, who declared himself to be Bichard,

Duke of York, the second son of King Edward the 
Fourth. “ 0,” said some, even of those ready Irish 
believers, “ but surely that young Prince was mur- 
dered by his uncle in the Tower !” — “It is supposed 
so,” said the engaging young man; “and my brother 
was killed in that gloomy prison; but I escaped — it 
don’t matter how, at present — and have been wandering 
about the world for seven long years.” This explanation 
being quite satisfactory to numbers of the Irish people, 
they began again to shout and to hurrah, and to drink 
his health, and to make the noisy and thirsty demon- 
strations all over again. And the big chieftain in 
Dublin began to look out for another coronation, 
and another young King to be carried home on his 
back. 

Now, King Henry being then on bad terms with 
France, the French King, Charles the Eighth, saw 
that, by pretending to believe in the handsome young 
man, he could trouble his enemy sorely. So, he invited 
him over to the French Court, and appointed him a 
body-guard, and treated him in all respects as if he 
really were the Duke of York. Peace however being 
soon concluded between the two Kings, the pretended 
Puke was turned adrift, and wandered for protection 
to the Duchess of Burgundy. She, after feigning to

inquire into the reality of his claims, declared him to 
be the very picture of her dear departed brother ; gave 
him a body-guard at her Court, of thirty halberdiers; 
and called him by the sounding name of the White 
Rose of England. 

The leading members of the White Rose party in 
England sent over an agent, named Sir Robert 
Clifford, to ascertain whether the White Rose’s claims 
were good : the King also sent over his agents to 
inquire into the Rose’s history. The White Roses 
declared the young man to be really the Duke of York; 
the King declared him to be Perkin Warbeck, the 
son of a merchant of the city of Toumay, who had 
acquired his knowledge of England, its language and 
manners, from the English merchants who traded in 
Flanders ; it was also stated by the Royal agents that 
he had been in the service of Lady Brompton, the 
wife of an exiled English nobleman, and that the 
Duchess of Burgundy had caused him to be trained 
and taught, expressly for this deception. The King 
then required the Archduke Philip — who was the 
sovereign of Burgundy — to banish this new Pretender, 
or to deliver him up ; but, as the Archduke replied 
that he could not control the Duchess in her own 
land, the King, in revenge, took the market of English

cloth away from Antwerp, and prevented all commer- 
cial intercourse between the two countries. 

He also, by arts and bribes, prevailed on Sir Kobert 
Clifford to betray his employers ; and he denouncing 
several famous English noblemen as being secretly 
the friends of Perkin Warbeck, the King had three 
of the foremost executed at once. Whether he par- 
doned the remainder because they were poor, I do not 
know ; but it is only too probable that he refused to 
pardon one famous nobleman against whom the same 
Clifford soon afterwards informed separately, because 
he was rich. This was no other than Sir William 
Stanley, who had saved the King’s life at the battle 
of Bosworth Field. It is very doubtful whether his 
treason amounted to much more than his having said, 
that if he were sure the young man was the Duke of 
York, he would not take arms against him. Whatever 
he had done he admitted, like an honourable spirit; 
and he lost his head for it, and the covetous Kin g 
gained all his wealth. 

Perkin Warbeck kept quiet for three years ; but, as 
the Flemings began to complain heavily of the loss of 
their trade by the stoppage of the Antwerp market on 
his account, and as it was not unlikely that they might 
even go so far as to take his life or give him up, he

found it necessary to do something. Accordingly he 
made a desperate sally, and landed, with only a few 
hundred men, on the coast of Deal. But he was soon 
glad to get back to the place from whence he came ; 
for the country people rose against his followers, killed 
a great many, and took a hundred and fifty prisoners : 
who were all driven to London, tied together with 
ropes, like a team of cattle. Every one of them was 
hanged on some part or other of the sea-shore; in order, 
that if any more men should come over with Perkin 
Warbeck, they might see the bodies as a warning 
before they landed. 

Then the wary King, by making a treaty of com- 
merce with the Flemings, drove Perkin Warbeck out 
of that country; and, by completely gaining over the 
Irish to his side, deprived him of that asylum too. He 
wandered away to Scotland, and told his story at that 
Court. King James the Fourth of Scotland, who was 
no friend to King Henry, and had no reason to be 
(for King Henry had bribed his Scotch lords to betray 
him more than once ; but had never succeeded in his 
plots), gave him a great reception, called him his 
cousin, and gave him in marriage the Lady Catherine 
Gordon, a beautiful and charming creature related to 
the royal house of Stuart.

10 A child's HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 

Alarmed by this successful re-appearance of the 
Pretender, the King still undermined, and bought, and 
bribed, and kept his doings and Perkin Warbeck’s 
story in the dark, when he might, one would imagine, 
have rendered the matter clear to all England. But, 
for all his bribing of the Scotch lords at the Scotch 
King’s Court, he could not procure the Pretender to 
be delivered up to him. James, though not very par- 
ticular in many respects, would not betray him ; and 
the ever-busy Duchess of Burgundy so provided him 
with arms, and good soldiers, and with money besides, 
that he had soon a little army of fifteen hundred men 
of various nations. With these, and aided by the 
Scottish King in person, he crossed the border into 
England, and made a proclamation to the people, in 
which he called the King “ Henry Tudor ; ” offered 
large rewards to any who should take or distress him ; 
and announced himself as King Richard the Fourth, 
come to receive the homage of his faithful subjects. 
His faithful subjects, however, cared nothing for him, 
and hated his faithful troops : who, being of different 
nations, quarrelled also among themselves. Worse 
than this, if worse were possible, they began to plunder 
the country ; upon which the White Rose said, that 
he would rather lose his rights, than gain them through

the miseries of the English people. The Scottish 
King made a jest of his scruples; but they and 
their whole force went back again without fighting a 
battle. 

The worst consequence of this attempt was, that 
a rising took place among the people of Cornwall, who 
considered themselves too heavily taxed to meet the 
charges of the expected war. Stimulated by Flam- 
mock, a lawyer, and Joseph, a blacksmith, and joined 
by Lord Audley and some other country gentlemen, 
they marched on all the way to Deptford Bridge, where 
they fought a battle with the King’s army. They 
were defeated — though the Cornish men fought with 
great bravery — and the lord was beheaded, and the 
lawyer and the blacksmith were hanged, drawn, and 
quartered. The rest were pardoned. The King, who 
believed every man to be as avaricious as himself, 
and thought that money could settle anything, allowed 
them to make bargains for their liberty with the sol- 
diers who had taken them. 

Perkin Warbeck, doomed to wander up and down, 
and never to find rest anywhere — a sad fate : almost 
a sufficient punishment for an imposture, which he 
seems in time to have half believed himself — lost his 
Scottish refuge through a truce being made between

the two Kings ; and found himself, once more, without a 
country before him in which he could lay his head. But 
James (always honourable and true to him, alike when 
he melted.down his plate, and even the great gold chain 
he had been used to wear, to pay soldiers in his cause ; 
and now, when that cause was lost and hopeless) did 
not conclude the treaty, until he had safely departed 
out of the Scottish dominions. He, and his beautiful 
wife, who was faithful to him under all reverses, and 
left her state and home to follow his poor fortunes, 
were put aboard ship with everything necessary for 
their comfort and protection, and sailed for Ireland. 

But, the Irish people had had enough of counterfeit 
Earls of Warwick and Dukes of York, for one while ; 
and would give the White Rose no aid. So, the White 
Rose — encircled by thorns indeed — resolved to go with 
his beautiful wife to Cornwall as a forlorn resource, 
and see what might be made of the Cornish men, who 
had risen so valiantly a little while before, and had 
fought so bravely at Deptford Bridge. 

To Whitsand Bay, in Cornwall, accordingly, came 
Perkin Warbeck and his wife ; and the lovely lady he 
shut up for safety in the Castle of St. Michael's Mount, 
and then marched into Devonshire at the head of three 
thousand Cornish men. These were increased to six

thousand by the time of his arrival in Exeter; but, 
there the people made a stout resistance, and he went 
on to Taunton, where he came in sight of the King’s 
army. The stout Cornish men, although they were 
few in number, and badly armed, were so bold, that 
they never thought of retreating ; but bravely looked 
forward to a battle on the morrow. Unhappily for 
them, the man who was possessed of so many engaging 
qualities, and who attracted so many people to his side 
when he had nothing else with which to tempt them, 
was not as brave as they. In the night, when the two 
armies lay opposite to each other, he mounted a swift 
horse and fled. When morning dawned, the poor 
confiding Cornish men, discovering that they had no 
leader, surrendered to the King’s power. Some of 
them were hanged, and the rest were pardoned, and 
went miserably home. 

Before the King pursued Perkin Warbeck to the 
sanctuary of Beaulieu in the New Forest, where it was 
soon known that he had taken refuge, he sent a body 
of horsemen to Saint Michael’s Mount, to seize his 
wife. She was soon taken, and brought as a captive 
before the Kin g. But she was so beautiful, and so 
good, and so devoted to the man in whom she believed, 
that the King regarded her with compassion, treated

her with great respect, and placed her at Court, near 
the Queen’s person. And many years after Perkin 
Warbeck was no more, and when his strange story had 
become like a nursery tale, she was called the White 
Rose, by the people, in remembrance of her beauty. 

The sanctuary at Beaulieu was soon surrounded by 
the King’s men; and the King, pursuing his usual 
dark artful ways, sent pretended friends to Perkin 
Warbeck to persuade him to come out and surrender 
himself. This he soon did ; the King having taken a 
good look at the man of whom he had heard so much 
— from behind a screen — directed him to be well 
mounted, and to ride behind him at a little distance, 
guarded, but not bound in any way. So they entered 
London with the King’s favourite show — a procession ; 
and some of the people hooted as the Pretender rode 
slowly through the streets to the Tower; but the 
greater part were quiet, and very curious to see him. 
From the Tower, he was taken to the Palace at 
Westminster, and there lodged like a gentleman, 
though closely watched. He was examined every 
now and then as to his imposture ; but the King was 
so secret in all he did, that even then he gave it a 
consequence, which it cannot be supposed to have in 
itself deserved.

At last Perkin Warbeck ran away, and took refuge 
in another sanctuary near Richmond in Surrey. From 
this he was again persuaded to deliver himself up; 
and, being conveyed to London, he stood in the stocks 
for a whole day, outside Westminster Hall, and there 
read a paper purporting to be his full confession, and 
relating his history as the King’s agents had originally 
described it. He was then shut up in the Tower 
again, in the company of the Earl of Warwick, who 
had now been there for fourteen years : ever since his 
removal out of Yorkshire, except when the King had 
had him at Court, and had shown him to the people, 
to prove the imposture of the Baker’s boy. It is but 
too probable, when we consider the crafty character 
of Henry the Seventh, that these two were brought 
together for a cruel purpose. A plot was soon dis- 
covered between them and the keepers, to murder 
the Governor, get possession of the keys, and pro- 
claim Perkin Warbeck as King Richard the Fourth. 
That there was some such plot, is likely; that they 
were tempted into it, is at least as likely; that the 
unfortunate Earl of Warwick — last male of the 
Plantagenet line — was too unused to the world, and 
too ignorant and simple to know much about it, what- 
ever it was, is perfectly certain ; and that it was the

King’s interest to get rid of him, is no less so. He 
was beheaded on Tower Hill, and Perkin Warbeck 
was hanged at Tyburn. 

Such was the end of the pretended Duke of York, 
whose shadowy history was made more shadowy — and 
ever will be henceforth — by the mystery and craft of 
the King. If he had turned his great natural advan- 
tages to a more honest account, he might have lived a 
happy and respected life, even in those days. But he 
died upon a gallows at Tyburn, leaving the Scottish 
lady who had loved him so well, kindly protected at 
the Queen’s Court. After some time she forgot her 
old loves and troubles, as so many people do with 
Time’s merciful assistance, and married a Welsh 
gentleman. Her second husband, Sir Matthew 
Cradoc, more honest and more happy than her first, 
lies beside her in a tomb in the old church of Swansea. 

The ill-blood between France and England in this 
reign, arose out of the continued plotting of the 
Duchess of Burgundy, and disputes respecting the 
affairs of Brittany. The King feigned to be very 
patriotic, indignant, and warlike ; but he always con- 
trived so as never to make war in reality, and always 
to make money. His taxation of the people, on 
pretence of war with France, involved, at one time,

a very dangerous insurrection, headed by Sir John 
Egremont, and a common man called John a Chambre. 
But it was subdued by the royal forces, under the 
command of the Earl of Surrey. The knighted John 
escaped to the Duchess of Burgundy, who was ever 
ready to receive any one who gave the King trouble ; 
and the plain John was hanged at York, in the midst 
of a number of his men, but on a much higher gibbet, 
as being a greater traitor. Hung high or hung low, 
however, hanging is much the same to the person 
hung. 

Within a year after her marriage, the Queen had 
given birth to a son, who was called Prince Arthur, 
in remembrance of the old British prince of romance 
and story; and who, when all these events had 
happened, being then in his fifteenth year, was married 
to Catherine, the daughter of the Spanish monarch, 
with great rejoicings and bright prospects; but in a 
very few months he sickened and died. As soon as 
the King had recovered from his grief, he thought it 
a pity that the fortune of the Spanish Princess, 
amounting to two hundred thousand crowns, should 
go out of the family ; and therefore arranged that the 
young widow should marry his second son Henry, 

then twelve years of age, when he too should be fifteen.

There were objections to this marriage on the part 
of the clergy ; but, as the infallible Pope was gained 
over; and, as he must be right, that settled the business 
for the time. The King’s eldest daughter was provided 
for, and a long course of disturbance was considered 
to be set at rest, by her being married to the Scottish 
King. 

And now the Queen died. When the King had got 
over that grief too, his mind once more reverted to his 
darling money for consolation, and he thought of 
marrying the dowager Queen of Naples, who was 
immensely rich: but, as it turned out not to be 
practicable to gain the money, however practicable it 
might have been to gain the lady, he gave up the idea. 
He was not so fond of her but that he soon proposed 
to marry the Dowager Duchess of Savoy; and, soon 
afterwards, the widow of the King of Castile who was 
raving mad. But he made a money-bargain instead, 
and married neither. 

The Duchess of Burgundy, among the other dis- 
contented people to whom she had given refuge, had 
sheltered Edmund de la Pole (younger brother of 
that Earl of Lincoln who was killed at Stoke), now 
Earl of Suffolk. The King had prevailed upon him 
to return to the marriage of Prince Arthur; but, he

soon afterwards went away again ; and then the King, 
suspecting a conspiracy, resorted to his favourite plan 
of sending him some treacherous friends, and buying 
of those scoundrels the secrets they disclosed or 
invented. Some arrests and executions took place 
in consequence. In the end, the Bang, on a promise 
of not taking his life, obtained possession of the 
person of Edmund de la Pole, and shut him up in 
the Tower. 

This was his last enemy. If he had lived much 
longer he would have made many more among the 
people, by the grinding exaction to which he con- 
stantly exposed them, aDd by the tyrannical acts of 
his two prime favourites in all money-raising matters, 
Edmund Dudley and Richard Empson. But Death 
— the enemy who is not to be bought off or deceived ; 
and on whom no money, and no treachery, has any 
effect — presented himself at this juncture, and ended 
the King’s reign. He died of the gout on the twenty- 
second of April, one thousand five hundred and nine, 
in the fifty-third year of his age, after reigning twenty- 
four years ; and was buried in the beautiful Chapel of 
Westminster Abbey, which he had himself founded, 
and which still bears his name. 

It was in this reign that the great Christopher

Columbus, on behalf of Spain, discovered what was 
then called The New World. Great wonder, interest, 
and hope of wealth being awakened in England 
thereby, the King and the merchants of London and 
Bristol fitted out an English expedition for further 
discoveries in the New World, and entrusted it to 
Sebastian Cabot, of Bristol, the son of a Venetian 
pilot there. He was very successful in his voyage, 
and gained high reputation, both for himself and 
England. 


CHAPTER XXVII. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH, CALLED BLUFF 
KING HAL AND BURLY KING HARRY. 

We now come to King Henry the Eighth, whom it 
has been too much the fashion to call “ Bluff King 
Hal,” and “ Burly King Harry,” and other fine names ; 
but whom I shall take the liberty to call, plainly, one 
of the most detestable villains that ever drew breath. 
You will be able to judge, long before we come to the 
end of his life, whether he deserves the character. 

He was just eighteen years of age when he came to 
the throne. People said he was handsome then ; but 
I don’t believe it. He was a big, burly, noisy, small-

eyed, large-faced, double-chinned, swinish looking 
fellow in later life (as we know from the likenesses of 
him, painted by the famous Hans Holbein), and it is 
not easy to believe that so bad a character can ever 
have been veiled under a prepossessing appearance. 

He was anxious to make himself popular ; and the 
people, who had long disliked the late King, were very 
willing to believe that he deserved to be so. He was 
extremely fond of show and display, and so were they. 
Therefore there was great rejoicing when he married 
the Princess Catherine, and when they were both 
crowned. And the King fought at tournaments and 
always came off victorious — for the courtiers took care 
of that — and there was a general outcry that he was a 
wonderful man. Empson, Dudley, and their supporters 
were accused of a variety of crimes they had never 
committed, instead of the offences of which they really 
had been guilty ; and they were pilloried, and set upon 
horses with their faces to the tails, and knocked about 
and beheaded, to the satisfaction of the people, and the 
enrichment of the King. 

The Pope, so indefatigable in getting the world into 
trouble, had mixed himself up in a war on the continent 
of Europe, occasioned by the reigning Princes of little 
quarrelling states in Italy having at various times

married into other Royal families, and so led to their 
claiming a share in those petty Governments. The 
King, who discovered that he was very fond of the 
Pope, sent a herald to the King of France, to say that 
he must not make war upon that holy personage, 
because he was the father of all Christians. As the 
French King did not mind this relationship in the least, 
and also refused to admit a claim King Henry made to 
certain lands in France, war was declared between the 
two countries. Not to perplex this story with an 
account of the tricks and designs of all the sovereigns 
who were engaged in it, it is enough to say that Eng- 
land made a blundering alliance with Spain, and got 
stupidly taken in by that country ; which made its own 
terms with France when it could, and left England in 
the lurch. Sir Edward Howard, a bold admiral, son 
of the Earl of Surrey, distinguished himself by his 
bravery against the French in this business; but, un- 
fortunately, he was more brave than wise, for, skimming 
into the French harbour of Brest with only a few row- 
boats, he attempted (in revenge for the defeat and 
death of Sir Thomas Knyvett, another bold English 
admiral) to take some strong French ships, well de- 
fended with batteries of cannon. The upshot was, 
that he was left on board of one of them (in conse-

quence of its shooting away from his own boat), with 
not more than about a dozen men, and was thrown into 
the sea and drowned : though not until he had taken 
from his breast his gold chain and gold whistle, which 
were the signs of his office, and had cast them into the 
sea to prevent their being made a boast of by the 
enemy. After this defeat — which was a great one, for 
Sir Edward Howard was a man of valour and fame — 
the King took it into his head to invade France in 
person ; first executing that dangerous Earl of Suffolk 
whom his father had left in the Tower, and appointing 
Queen Catherine to the charge of his kingdom in his 
absence. He sailed to Calais, where he was joined 
by Maximilian, Emperor of Germany, who pretended 
to be his soldier, and who took pay in his service : with 
a good deal of nonsense of that sort, flattering enough 
to the vanity of a vain blusterer. The King might be 
successful enough in sham fights ; but his idea of real 
battles chiefly consisted in pitching silken tents of 
bright colours that were ignominiously blown down by 
the wind, and in making a vast display of gaudy flags 
and golden curtains. Fortune, however, favoured him 
better than he deserved ; for, after much waste of time 
in tent pitching, flag flying, gold curtaining, and other 
such masquerading, he gave the French battle at a place

called Guinegate : where they took such an unaccount- 
able panic, and fled with such swiftness, that it was 
ever afterwards called by the English the Battle of 
Spurs. Instead of following up his advantage, the 
King, finding that he had had enough of real fighting, 
came home again. 

The Scottish King, though nearly related to Henry 
by marriage, had taken part against him in this war* 
The Earl of Surrey, as the English general, advanced 
to meet him when he came out of his own dominions 
and crossed the river Tweed. The two armies came 
up with one another when the Scottish King had also 
crossed the river Till, and was encamped upon the last 
of the Cheviot Hills, called the Hill of Flodden. Along 
the plain below it, the English, when the hour of battle 
came, advanced. The Scottish army, which had been 
drawn up in five great bodies, then came steadily down, 
in perfect silence. So they, in their turn, advanced to 
meet the English army which came on in one long line; 
and they attacked it with a body of spearmen, under 
Lord Home. At first they had the best of it ; but the 
English recovered themselves so bravely, and fought 
with such valour, that, when the Scottish King had 
almost made his way up to the Royal standard, he was 
slain, and the whole Scottish power routed. Ten

thousand Scottish men lay dead that day on Flodden 
Field ; and among them, numbers of the nobility and 
gentry. For a long time afterwards, the Scottish pea- 
santry used to believe that their King had not been 
really killed in this battle, because no Englishman had 
found an iron belt he wore about his body as a penance 
for having been an unnatural and undutiful son. But, 
whatever became of his belt, the English had his sword 
and dagger, and the ring from his finger, and his body 
too, covered with wounds. There is no doubt of it ; for 
it was seen and recognised by English gentlemen who 
had known the Scottish King well. 

When King Henry was making ready to renew the 
war in France, the French King was contemplating 
peace. His queen, dying at this time, he proposed, 
though he was upwards of fifty years old, to marry 
King Henry’s sister, the Princess Mary, who, besides 
being only sixteen, was betrothed to the Duke of 
Suffolk. As the inclinations of young Princesses were 
not much considered in such matters, the marriage was 
concluded, and the poor girl was escorted to France, 
where she was immediately left as the French King’s 
bride, with only one of all her English attendants. 
That one was a pretty young girl named Anne Boleyn, 
niece of the Earl of Surrey, who had been made Duke

of Norfolk after the victory of Flodden Field. Anne 
Boleyn’s is a name to be remembered, as you will 
presently find. 

And now the French King, who was very proud of 
his young wife, was preparing for many years of happi- 
ness, and she was looking forward, I dare say, to many 
years of misery, when he died within three months, 
and left her a young widow. The new French monarch, 
Francis the First, seeing how important it was to his 
interests that she should take for her second husband 
no one but an Englishman, advised her first lover, the 
Duke of Suffolk, when King Henry sent him over to 
France to fetch her home, to marry her. The Princess 
being herself so fond of that Duke, as to tell him that 
he must either do so then, or for ever lose her, they 
were wedded ; and Henry afterwards forgave them. In 
making interest with the King, the Duke of Suffolk 
had addressed his most powerful' favourite and adviser, 
Thomas Wolsey — a name very famous in history for 
its rise and downfall. 

Wolsey was the son of a respectable butcher at 
Ipswich, in Suffolk, and received so excellent an educa- 
tion that he became a tutor to the family of the Marquis 
of Dorset, who afterwards got him appointed one of the 
late King's chaplains. On the accession of Henry the

Eighth, he was promoted and taken into great favour. 
He was now Archbishop of York ; the Pope had made 
him a Cardinal besides ; and whoever wanted influence 
in England or favour with the King— whether he were 
a foreign monarch or an English nobleman — was obliged 
to make a friend of the great Cardinal Wolsey. 

He was a gay man, who could dance and jest, and 
sing and drink ; and those were the roads to so much, 
or rather so little, of a heart as King Henry had. He 
was wonderfully fond of pomp and glitter, and so was 
the King. He knew a good deal of the Church learn- 
ing of that time ; much of which consisted in finding 
artful excuses and pretences for almost any wrong 
thing, and in arguing that black was white, or any 
other colour. This kind of learning pleased the Kin g 
too. For many such reasons, the Cardinal was high 
in estimation with the King ; and, being a man of far 
greater ability, knew as well how to manage him, as a 
clever keeper may know how to manage a wolf or a tiger, 
or any other cruel and uncertain beast, that may turn 
upon him and tear him any day. Never had there been 
seen in England such state as my Lord Cardinal kept. 
His wealth was enormous; equal, it was reckoned, to 
the riches of the Crown. His palaces were as splendid 
as the King’s, and his retinue was eight hundred strong.

He held his Court, dressed out from top to toe in 
flaming scarlet; and his very shoes were golden, set 
with precious stones. His followers rode on blood 
horses ; while he, with a wonderful affectation of humility 
in the midst of his great splendour, ambled on a mule 
with a red velvet saddle and bridle and golden stirrups. 

Through the influence of this stately priest, a grand 
meeting was arranged to take place between the French 
and English Kings in France ; but on ground belonging 
to England. A prodigious show of friendship and 
rejoicing was to be made on the occasion ; and heralds 
were sent to proclaim with brazen trumpets through all 
the principal cities of Europe, that, on a certain day, the 
Kings of France and England, as companions and 
brothers in arms each attended by eighteen followers, 
would hold a tournament against all knights who might 
choose to come. 

Chables, the new Emperor of Germany (the old one 
being dead), wanted to prevent too cordial an alliance 
between these sovereigns, and came over to England 
before the King could repair to the place of meeting ; 
and, besides making an agreeable impression upon him, 
secured Wolsey’s interest by promising that his influ- 
ence should make him Pope when the next vacancy 
occurred. On the day when the Emperor left Eng-

land, the King and all the Court went over to Calais, 
and thence to the place of meeting, between Ardres and 
Guisnes, commonly called the Field of the Cloth of 
Gold. Here, all manner of expense and prodigality 
was lavished on the decorations of the show ; many of 
the knights and gentlemen being so superbly dressed 
that it was said they carried their whole estates upon 
their shoulders. 

There were sham castles, temporary chapels, foun- 
tains running wine, great cellars full of wine free as 
water to all comers, silk tents, gold lace and foil, gilt 
lions, and such things without end ; and, in the midst of 
all, the rich Cardinal out-shone and out-glittered all 
the noblemen and gentlemen assembled. After a treaty 
made between the two Kings with as much solemnity 
as if they had intended to keep it, the lists — nine 
hundred feet long, and three hundred and twenty broad 
— were opened for the tournament; the Queens of 
France and England looking on with great array of 
lord and ladies. Then, for ten days, the two sovereigns 
fought five combats every day, and always beat their 
polite adversaries ; though they do write that the King 
of England, being thrown in a wrestle one day by the 
Kin g of France, lost his kingly temper with his brother 
in arms, and wanted to make a quarrel of it. Then,

there is a great story belonging to this Field of the 
Cloth of Gold, showing how the English were distrust- 
ful of the French, and the French of the English, until 
Francis rode alone one morning to Henry’s tent ; and, 
going in before he was out of bed, told him in joke that 
he was his prisoner ; and how Henry jumped out of 
bed and embraced Francis ; and how Francis helped 
Henry to dress, and warmed his linen for him; and 
how Henry gave Francis a splendid jewelled collar, and 
how Francis gave Henry, in return, a costly bracelet. 
All this and a great deal more was so written about, 
and sung about, and talked about at that time (and, 
indeed, since that time too), that the world has had good 
cause to be sick of it, for ever. 

Of course, nothing came of all these fine doings but 
a speedy renewal of the war between England and 
France, in which the two Royal companions and 
brothers in arms longed very earnestly to damage one 
another. But, before it broke out again, the Duke of 
Buckingham was shamefully executed on Tower Hill, 
on the evidence of a discharged servant — really for 
nothing, except the folly of having believed in a friar 
of the name of Hopkins, who had pretended to be a 
prophet, and who had mumbled and jumbled out some 
nonsense about the Duke’s son being destined to be

very great in the land. It was believed that the unfor- 
tunate Duke had given offence to the great Cardinal by 
expressing his mind freely about the expense and absur- 
dity of the whole business of the Field of the Cloth of 
Gold. At any rate, he was beheaded, as I have said, 
for nothing. And the people who saw it done were 
very angry, and cried out that it was the work of “ the 
butcher’s son ! ” 

The new war was a short one, though the Earl of 
Surrey invaded France again, and did some injury to 
that country. It ended in another treaty of peace 
between the two kingdoms, and in the discovery that 
the Emperor of Germany was not such a good friend 
to England in reality, as he pretended to be. Neither 
did he keep his promise to Wolsey to make him Pope, 
though the King urged him. Two Popes died in pretty 
quick succession ; but the foreign priests were too much 
for the Cardinal, and kept him out of the post. So the 
Cardinal and King together found out that the Emperor 
of Germany was not a man to keep faith with ; broke 
off a projected marriage between the King’s daughter 
Mary, Princess of Wales, and that sovereign; and 
began to consider whether it might not be well to marry 
the young lady, either to Francis himself, or to his 
eldest son.

There now arose at Wittemberg, in Germany, the 
great leader of the mighty change in England which is 
called The Reformation, and which set the people free 
from their slavery to the priests. This was a learned 
Doctor, named Martin Luther, who knew all about 
them, for he had been a priest, and even a monk, him- 
self. The preaching and writing of Wickliffe, men- 
tioned in the last volume, had set a number of men 
thinking on this subject; and Luther, finding one day 
to his great surprise, that there really was a book 
called the New Testament which the priests did not 
allow to be read, and which contained truths that they 
suppressed, began to be very vigorous against the 
whole body, from the Pope downward. It happened, 
while he was yet only beginning his vast work of 
awakening the nation, that an impudent fellow named 
Tetzel, a friar of very bad character, came into his 
neighbourhood selling what were called Indulgences, 
by wholesale, to raise money for beautifying the great 
Cathedral of St. Peter’s, at Rome. Whoever bought 
an Indulgence of the Pope was supposed to buy him- 
self off from the punishment of Heaven for his offences. 
Luther told the people that these Indulgences were 
worthless bits of paper, before God, and that Tetzel 
and his masters were a crew of impostors in selling them.

The King tad the Cardinal were mightily indignant 
at this presumption ; and the King (with the help of 
Sir Thomas More, k wise man, whom he afterwards 
repaid by striking off his head) even wrote a book about 
it, with which the Pope was so well pleased that he 
gave the King the title of Defender of the Faith. The 
King and the Cardinal also issued flaming warnings to 
the people not to read Luther's books, on pain of ex- 
communication. But they did read them for a'l that; 
and the rumour of what was in them spread far and 
wide. 

When this great change was thus going on, the King 
began to show himself in his truest and worst colors. 
Anne Boleyn, the pretty little girl who had gone abroad 
to France with his sister, was by this time grown up 
to be very beautiful, and was one of the ladies in attend- 
ance on Queen Catherine. Now, Queen Catherine 
was no longer young or handsome, and it is likely that 
she was not particularly good-tempered ; having been 
always rather melancholy, and having been made more 
so by the deaths of four of her children when they 
were very young. So, the King fell in love with the 
fair Anne Boleyn, and said to himself, “ How can I be 
best rid of my own troublesome wife whom I am tired 
of, and marry Anne ? ”

A child's HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


You recollect that Queen Catherine had been the 
wife of Henry’s young brother. What does the 
King do, after thinking it over, but calls his favorite 
priests about him, and says, O ! his mind is in such a 
dreadful state, and he is so frightfully uneasy, because 
he is afraid it was not lawful for him to marry the 
Queen ! Not one of those priests had the courage to 
hint that it was rather curious he had never thought 
of that before, and that his mind seemed to have been 
in a tolerably jolly condition during a great many 
years, in which he certainly had not fretted himself 
thin ; but, they all said, Ah ! that was very true, and 
it was a serious business; and perhaps the best way 
to make it right, would be for His Majesty to be 
divorced! The King replied, Yes, he thought that 
would be the best way, certainly; so they all went 
to work. 

If I were to relate to you the intrigues and plots 
that took place in the endeavour to get this divorce, 
you would think the History of England the most 
tiresome book in the world. So I shall say no more, 
than that after a vast deal of negotiation and evasion, 
the Pope issued a commission to Cardinal Wolsey and 
Cardinal Campeggio (whom he sent over from Italy 
for the purpose), to try the whole case in England.

It is supposed — and I think with reason — that Wolsey 
was the Queen’s enemy, because she had reproved him 
for his proud and gorgeous manner of life. But, he 
did not at first know that the King wanted to marry 
Anne Boleyn; and when he did know it, he even 
went down on his knees, in the endeavour to dissuade 
him. 

The Cardinals opened their court in the Convent 
of the Black Friars, near to where the bridge of that 
name in London now stands ; and the King and Queen, 
that they might be near it, took up their lodgings at 
the adjoining palace of Bridewell, of which nothing 
now remains but a bad prison. On the opening of 
the court, when the King and Queen were called on 
to appear, that poor ill-used lady, with a dignity and 
firmness and yet with a womanly affection worthy to 
be always admired, went and kneeled at the King’s 
feet, and said that she had come, a stranger, to his 
dominions; that she had been a good and true wife 
to him for twenty years ; and that she could acknow- 
ledge no power in those Cardinals to try whether 
she should be considered his wife after all that time, 
or should be put away. With that, she got up and 
left the court, and would never afterwards come back 
to it.

The King pretended to be very much overcome, 
and said, O ! my lords and gentlemen, what a good 
woman she was to be sure, and how delighted he 
would be to live with her unto death, but for that 
terrible uneasiness in his mind which was quite wear- 
ing him away ! So, the case went on, and there was 
nothing but talk for two months. Then Cardinal 
Campeggio who, on behalf of the Pope, wanted 
nothing so much as delay , adjourned it for two more ; 
and before that time was elapsed, the Pope himself 
adjourned it indefinitely, by requiring the King and 
Queen to come to Rome and have it tried there. But 
by good luck for the King, word was brought to him 
by some of his people, that they had happened to 
meet at supper Thomas Cranmer, a learned Doctor 
of Cambridge, who had proposed to urge the Pope on, 
by referring the case to all the learned doctors and 
bishops, here and there and everywhere, and getting 
their opinions that the King’s marriage was unlawful. 
The King, who was now getting into a hurry to marry 
Anne Boleyn, thought this such a good idea, that he 
sent for Cranmer, post haste, and said to Lord Roch- 
fort, Anne Boleyn’s father, “ Take this learned 
Doctor down to your country-house, and there let 
him have a good room for a study, and no end of

books out of which to prove that I may marry your 
daughter.* * Lord Rochfort, not at all reluctant, made 
the learned Doctor as comfortable as he could ; and 
the learned Doctor went to work to prove his case. 
All this time, the King and Anne Boleyn were writing 
letters to one another almost daily, full of impatience 
to have the case settled ; and Anne Boleyn was show- 
ing herself (as I think) very worthy of the fate which 
afterwards befell her. 

It was bad for Cardinal Wolsey that he had left 
Cranmer to render this help. It was worse for him 
that he had tried to dissuade the King from marrying 
Anne Boleyn. Such a servant as he, to such a master 
as Henry, would probably have fallen in any case; 
but, between the hatred of the party of the Queen 
that was, and the hatred of the party of the Queen 
that was to be, he fell suddenly and heavily. Going 
down one day to the Court of Chancery, where he 
now presided, he was waited upon by the Dukes of 
Norfolk and Suffolk, who told him that they brought 
cm order to him to resign that office, and to withdraw 
quietly to a house he had at Esher, in Surrey. The 
Cardinal refusing, they rode off to the King ; and next 
day came back with a letter from him, on reading 
which, the Cardinal submitted. An inventory was

made out of all the riches in his palace at York 
Place (now Whitehall), and he went sorrowfully up 
the river, in his barge, to Putney. An abject man he 
was, in spite of his pride ; for being overtaken, riding 
out of that place towards Esher, by one of the King’s 
chamberlains who brought him a kind message and 
a ring, he alighted from his mule, took off his caj), 
and kneeled down in the dirt. His poor fool, whom 
in his prosperous days he had always kept in his palace 
to entertain him, cut a far better figure than he ; for, 
when the Cardinal said to the chamberlain that he 
had nothing to send to his lord the King as a present, 
but that jester who was a most excellent one, it took 
six strong yeomen to remove the faithful fool from his 
master. 

The once proud Cardinal was soon further dis- 
graced, and wrote the most abject letters to his vile 
sovereign ; who humbled him one day and encouraged 
him the next, according to his humour, until he was at 
last ordered to go and reside in his diocese of York. 
He said he was too poor ; but I don’t know how he 
made that out, for he took a hundred and sixty 
servants with him, and seventy-two cart-loads of 
furniture, food, and wine. He remained in that part 
of the country for the best part of a year, and showed

himself so improved by his misfortunes, and was so 
mild and so conciliating* that he won all hearts. And 
indeed, even in his proud days, he had done some 
magnificent things for learning and education. At 
last, he was arrested for high treason ; and, coming 
slowly on his journey towards London, got as far as 
Leicester. Arriving at Leicester Abbey after dark 
and very ill, he said — when the monks came out at 
the gate with lighted torches to receive him — that he 
had come to lay his bones among them. He had 
indeed ; for he was taken to a bed, from which he never 
rose again. His last words were, “ Had I but served 
God as diligently as I have served the King, He 
would not have given me over, in my grey hairs. 
Howbeit, this is my just reward for my pains and 
diligence, not regarding my service to God, but only 
my duty to my prince/’ The news of his death was 
quickly carried to the King, who was amusing himself 
with archery in the garden of the magnificent Palace 
at Hampton Court, which that very Wolsey had pre- 
sented to him. The greatest emotion his royal mind 
displayed at the loss of a servant so faithful and so 
ruined, was a particular desire to lay hold of fifteen 
hundred pounds which the Cardinal was reported to 
have hidden somewhere.

The opinions concerning the divorce, of the learned 
doctors and bishops and others, being at last collected, 
and being generally in the King’s favor, were forwarded 
to the Pope, with an entreaty that he would now grant 
it. The unfortunate Pope, who was a timid man, was 
half distracted between his fear of his authority being 
set aside in England if he did not do as he was asked, 
and his dread of offending the Emperor of Germany, 
who was Queen Catherine’s nephew. In this state of 
mind, he still evaded and did nothing. Then, 
Thomas Cromwell, who had been one of Wolsey’s 
faithful attendants and had remained so even in his 
decline, advised the King to take the matter into his 
own hands, and make himself the head of the whole 
Church. This, the King, by various artful means, 
began to do; but he recompensed the clergy by allow- 
ing them to bum as many people as they pleased, for 
holding Luther’s opinions. You must understand that 
Sir Thomas More, the wise man who had helped the 
King with his book, had been made Chancellor in 
Wolsey’s place. But, as he was truly attached to the 
Church as it was even in its abuses, he, in this state 
of things, resigned. 

Being now quite resolved to get rid of Queen Cathe- 
rine, and to marry Anne Boleyn without more ado.

the King made Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury, 
and directed Queen Catherine to leave the Court. 
She obeyed ; but replied that wherever she went, she 
was Queen of England still, and would remain so, to 
the last. The King then married Anne Boleyn 
privately; and the new Archbishop of Canterbury, 
within half a year, declared his marriage with Queen 
Catherine void, and crowned Anne Boleyn Queen. 

She might have known that no good could ever 
come from such wrong, and that the corpulent brute 
who had been so faithless and so cruel to his first 
wife, could be more faithless and more cruel to his 
second. She might have known that, even when he 
was in love with her, he had been a mean and selfish 
coward, running away, like a frightened cur, from her 
society and her house, when a dangerous sickness 
broke out in it, and when she might easily have taken 
it and died, as several of the household did. But, 
Anne Boleyn arrived at all this knowledge too late, 
and bought it at a dear price. Her bad marriage with 
a worse man came to its natural end. Its natural end 
was not, as we shall too soon see, a natural death for 
her.

CHAPTER XXYIII. 

The Pope was thrown into a very angry state of 
mind when he heard of the King’s marriage, and 
fumed exceedingly. Many of the English monks and 
friars, seeing that their order was in danger, did the 
same ; some even declaimed against the King in church 
before his face, and were not to be stopped until he 
himself roared out “ Silence ! ” The King, not much 
the worse for this, took it pretty quietly ; and was very 
glad when his Queen gave birth to a daughter, who was 
christened Elizabeth, and declared Princess of Wales 
as her sister Mary had already been. 

One of the most atrocious features of this reign was 
that Henry the Eighth was always trimming between 
the reformed religion and the unreformed one ; so that 
the more he quarrelled with the Pope, the more of his 
own subjects he roasted alive for not holding the Pope’s 
opinions. Thus, an unfortunate student named John 
Frith, and a poor simple tailor named Andrew Hewet 
who loved him very much, and said that whatever John 
Frith believed he believed, were burnt in Smithfield — 
to show what a capital Christian the King was.

But, these were speedily followed by two much 
greater victims, Sir Thomas More, and John Fisher 
the Bishop of Rochester. The latter, who was a good 
and amiable old man, had committed no greater offence 
than believing in Elizabeth Barton, called the Maid of 
Kent — another of those ridiculous women who pre- 
tended to be inspired, and to make all sorts of heavenly 
revelations, though they indeed uttered nothing but 
evil nonsense. For this offence — as it was pretended, 
but really for denying the King to be the supreme 
Head of the Church — he got into trouble, and was put 
in prison ; but, even then, he might have been suffered 
to die naturally (short work having been made of 
executing the Kentish Maid and her principal fol- 
lowers), but that the Pope, to spite the King, resolved 
to make him a cardinal. Upon that, the King made 
a ferocious joke to the effect that the Pope might send 
Fisher a red hat — which is the way they make a car- 
dinal — but he should have no head on which to wear 
it ; and he was tried with all unfairness and injustice, 
and sentenced to death. He died like a noble and 
virtuous old man, and left a worthy name behind him. 
The King supposed, I dare say, that Sir Thomas More 
would be frightened by this example ; but, as he was 
not to be easily terrified, and, thoroughly believing in

the Pope, had made up his mind that the King was 
not the rightful Head of the Church, he positively 
refused to say that he was. For this crime he too was 
tried and sentenced, after having been in prison a 
whole year. When he was doomed to death, and came 
away from his trial with the edge of the executioner’s 
axe turned towards him — as was always done in those 
times when a state prisoner came to that hopeless 
pass — he bore it quite serenely, and gave his blessing 
to his son, who pressed through the crowd in West' 
minster Hall and kneeled down to receive it. But, 
when he got to the Tower Wharf on his way back to 
his prison, and his favourite daughter Margaret 
Roper, a very good woman, rushed through the guards 
again and again, to kiss him and to weep upon his 
neck, he was overcome at last. He soon recovered, 
and never more showed any feeling but cheerfulness 
and courage. When he was going up the steps of the 
scaffold to his death, he said jokingly to the Lieutenant 
of the Tower, observing that they were weak and shook 
beneath his tread, “I pray you, master Lieutenant, 
see me safe up ; and, for my coming down, I can shift 
for myself.” Also he said to the executioner, after he 
had laid his head upon the block, " Let me put my 
beard out of the way ; for that, at least, has never com-

mitted any treason.” Then his head was struck off 
at a blow. These two executions were worthy of 
King Henry the Eighth. Sir Thomas More was one 
of the most virtuous men in his dominions, and the 
Bishop was one of his oldest and truest friends. But 
to be a friend of that fellow was almost as dangerous 
as to be his wife. 

When the news of these two murders got to Rome, 
the Pope raged against the murderer more than ever 
Pope raged since the world began, and prepared a 
Bull, ordering his subjects to take arms against him 
and dethrone him. The King took all possible pre- 
cautions to keep that document out of his dominions, 
and set to work in return to suppress a great number 
of the English monasteries and abbeys. 

This destruction was begun by a body of commis- 
sioners, of whom Cromwell (whom the King had taken 
into great favor) was the head ; and was carried on 
through some few years to its entire completion. 
There is no doubt that many of these religious es- 
tablishments were religious in nothing but in name, 
and were crammed with lazy, indolent, and sensual 
monks. There is no doubt that they imposed upon 
the people in every possible way ; that they had images 
moved by wires, which they pretended were mira-

culously moved by heaven ; that they had among them 
a whole tun measure full of teeth, all purporting to 
have come out of the head of one saint, who must 
indeed have been a very extraordinary person with 
that enormous allowance of grinders; that they had 
bits of coal, which they said had fried Saint Lawrence, 
and bits of toe-nails which they said belonged to other 
famous saints; penknives, and boots, and girdles, 
which they said belonged to others ; and that all these 
bits of rubbish were called Relics, and adored by the 
ignorant people. But, on the other hand, there is no 
doubt either, that the King’s officers and men punished 
the good monks with the bad; did great injustice; 
demolished many beautiful things and many valuable 
libraries ; destroyed numbers of paintings, stained glass 
windows, fine pavements, and carvings ; and that the 
whole court were ravenously greedy and rapacious for 
the division of this great spoil among them. The 
King seems to have grown almost mad in the ardor 
of this pursuit ; for he declared Thomas a Becket a 
traitor, though he had been dead so many years, and 
had his body dug up out of his grave. He must have 
been as miraculous as the monks pretended, if they 
had told the truth, for he was found with one head on 
his shoulders, and they had shown another as his

undoubted and genuine head ever since his death ; it 
had brought them vast sums of money, too. The 
gold and jewels on his shrine filled two great chests, 
and eight men tottered as they carried them away. 
How rich the monasteries were, you may infer from 
the fact that, when they were all suppressed, one 
hundred and thirty thousand pounds a-year — in those 
days an immense sum— came to the Crown. 

These things were not done without causing great 
discontent among the people. The monks had been 
good landlords and hospitable entertainers of all tra- 
vellers, and had been accustomed to give away a great 
deal of corn, and fruit, and meat, and other things. 
In those days it was difficult to change goods into 
money in consequence of the roads being very few 
and very bad, and the carts and wagons of the worst 
description; and they must either have given away 
some of the good things they possessed in enormous 
quantities, or have suffered them to spoil and moulder. 
So, many of the people missed what it was more agree- 
able to get idly than to work for ; and the monks who 
were driven out of their homes and wandered about, 
encouraged their discontent ; and there were, conse- 
quently, great risings in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. 
These were put down by terrific executions, from which

the monks themselves did not escape, and the King 
went on grunting and growling in his own fat way, 
like a Royal pig. 

I have told all this story of the religious houses 
at one time, to make it plainer, and to get back to 
the King’s domestic affairs. 

The unfortunate Queen Catherine was by this time 
dead ; and the King was by this time as tired of his 
Second Queen as he had been of his first. As he had 
fallen in love with Anne , when she was in the service 
of Catherine, so he now fell in love with another lady 
in the service of Anne. See how wicked deeds are 
punished, and how bitterly and self-reproachfully the 
Queen must now have thought of her own rise to the 
throne ! The new fancy was a Lady Jane Seymour ; 
and the King no sooner set his mind on her, than he 
resolved to have Anne Boleyn’s head. So, he brought 
a number of charges against Anne, accusing her 
of dreadful crimes which she had never committed, 
and implicating in them her own brother and certain 
gentlemen in her service ; among whom one Norris, 
and Mark Smeaton a musician, are best remembered. 
As the lords and councillors were as afraid of the 
King and as subservient to him as the meanest peasant 
in England, they brought in Anne Boleyn guilty, and

the other unfortunate persons accused with her, guilty 
too. Those gentlemen died like men, with the ex- 
ception of Smeaton, who had been tempted by the 
King into telling lies, which he called confessions, 
and who had expected to be pardoned ; but who, I am 
very glad to say, was not. There was then only the 
Queen to dispose of. She had been surrounded in 
the Tower with women spies; had been monstrously 
persecuted and foully slandered ; and had received no 
justice. But her spirit rose with her afflictions ; and, 
after having in vain tried to soften the King by writing 
an affecting letter to him which still exists, “from her 
doleful prison in the Tower,” she resigned herself to 
death. She said to those about her, very cheerfully, 
that she had heard say the executioner was a good one, 
and that she had a little neck (she laughed and clasped 
it with her hands as she said that), and would soon be 
out of her pain. And she was soon out of her pain, 
poor creature, on the Green inside the Tower, and her 
body was flung into an old box and put away in the 
ground under the chapel. 

There is a story that the King sat in his palace listen- 
ing very anxiously for the sound of the cannon which was 
to announce this new murder ; and that, when he heard 

it come booming on the air, he rose up in great spirits

and ordered out his dogs to go a-hunting. He was bad 
enough to do it; but whether he did it or not, it is cer- 
tain that he married Jane Seymour the very next day. 

I have not much pleasure in recording that she 
lived just long enough to give birth to a son who was 
christened Edward, and then to die of a fever : for, 
I cannot but think that any woman who married such a 
ruffian, and knew what innocent blood was on his hands, 
deserved the axe that would assuredly have fallen on 
the neck of Jane Seymour, if she had lived much longer. 

Cranmer had done what he could to save some of 
the Church property for purposes of religion and 
education ; but, the great families had been so hungry 
to get hold of it, that very little could be rescued for 
such objects. Even Miles Coverdale, who did the 
people the inestimable service of translating the Bible 
into English (which the unreformed religion never per- 
mitted to be done), was left in poverty while the great 
families clutched the Church lands and money. The 
people had been told that when the Crown came 
into possession of these funds, it would not be neces- 
sary to tax them ; but they were taxed afresh directly 
afterwards. It was fortunate for them, indeed, that 
so many nobles were so greedy for this wealth ; since, 
if it had remained with the Crown, there might have

been no end to tyranny for hundreds of years. One 
of the most active writers on the Church’s side against 
the Kin g was a member of his own family — a sort of 
distant cousin, Reginald Pole by name — who at- 
tacked him in the most violent manner (though he 
received a pension from him all the time), and fought 
for the Church with his pen, day and night. As he 
was beyond the King’s reach— being in Italy — the 
King politely invited him over to discuss the subject ; 
but he, knowing better than to come, and wisely 
staying where he was, the King’s rage fell upon his 
brother Lord Montague, the Marquis of Exeter, and 
some other gentlemen : who were tried for high treason 
in corresponding with him and aiding him — which 
they probably did — and were all executed. The Pope 
made Reginald Pole a cardinal ; but, so much against 
his will, that it is thought he even aspired in his own 
mind to the vacant throne of England, and had hopes 
of marrying the Princess Mary. His being made a 
high priest, however, put an end to all that. His 
mother, the venerable Countess of Salisbury — who 
was, unfortunately for herself, within the tyrant’s 
reach — was the last of his relatives on whom his wrath 
fell. When she was told to lay her grey head upon 
the block, she answered the executioner, “No! My

head never committed treason, and if you want it, you 
shall seize it.” So, she ran round and round the 
scaffold with the executioner striking at her, and her 
grey hair bedabbled with blood ; and even when they 
held her down upon the block she moved her head 
about to the last, resolved to be no party to her own 
barbarous murder. All this the people bore, as they 
had borne everything else. 

Indeed they bore much more ; for the slow fires of 
Smithfield were continually burning, and people were 
constantly being roasted to death — still to show what 
a good Christian the King was. He defied the Pope 
and his Bull, which was now issued, and had come into 
England ; but he burned innumerable people whose 
only offence was that they differed from the Pope’s 
religious opinions. There was a wretched man named 
Lambebt, among others, who was tried for this before 
the King, and with whom six bishops argued one after 
another. When he was quite exhausted (as well he 
might be, after six bishops), he threw himself on the 
King's mercy; but the King blustered out that he had 
no mercy for heretics. So, he too fed the fire. 

All this the people bore, and more than all this yet. 
The national spirit seems to have been banished from 
the kingdom at this time. The very people who were

executed for treason, the very wives and friends of the 
“ bluff” King, spoke of him on the scaffold as a good 
prince, and a gentle prince — -just as serfs in similar 
circumstances have been known to do, under the Sultan 
and Bashaws of the East, or under the fierce old tyrants 
of Russia, who poured boiling and freezing water on 
them alternately, until they died. The Parliament 
were as bad as the rest, and gave the King whatever he 
wanted ; among other vile accommodations, they gave 
him new powers of murdering, at his will and pleasure, 
any one whom he might choose to call a traitor. But 
the worst measure they passed was an Act of Six 
Articles, commonly called at the time $t the whip with 
six strings ; ” which punished offences against the Pope's 
opinions without mercy, and enforced the very worst 
parts of the monkish religion. Cranmer would have 
modified it, if he could ; but, being overborne by the 
Romish party, had not the power. As one of the 
articles declared that priests should not marry, and as 
he was married himself, he sent his wife and children 
into Germany, and began to tremble at his danger ; 
none the less because he was, and had long been, the 
King's friend. This whip of six strings was made 
under the King’s own eye. It should never be forgotten 
of him how cruelly he supported the worst of the

Popish doctrines when there was nothing to he got by 
opposing them. 

This amiable monarch now thought of taking another 
wife. He proposed to the French King to have some 
of the ladies of the French Court exhibited before him, 
that he might make his Royal choice ; but the French 
King answered that he would rather not have his ladies 
trotted out to be shown like horses at a fair. He pro- 
posed to the Dowager Duchess of Milan, who replied 
that she might have thought of such a match if she had 
had two heads ; but, that only owning one, she must 
beg to keep it safe. At last Cromwell represented that 
there was a Protestant princess in Germany — those who 
held the reformed religion were called Protestants, 
because their leaders had Protested against the abuses 
and impositions of the unreformed Church — named 
Anne of Cleves, who was beautiful, and would answer 
the purpose admirably. The King said was she a large 
woman, because he must have a fat wife ? “0 yes,” 

said Cromwell ; “ she was very large, just the thing.” 
On hearing this the King sent over his famous painter, 
Hans Holbein, to take her portrait. Hans made her 
out to be so good-looking that the King was satisfied, and 
the marriage was arranged. But, whether anybody had 
paid Hans to touch up the picture ; or whether Hans,

like one or two other painters, flattered a princess in 
the ordinary way of business, I cannot say : all I know 
is, that when Anne came over and the King went to 
Rochester to meet her, and first saw her without her 
seeing him, he swore she was a great Flanders mare, 
and said he would never marry her. Being obliged to 
do it now matters had gone so far, he would not give 
her the presents he had prepared, and would never 
notice her. ' He never forgave Cromwell his part in the 
affair. His downfall dates from that time. 

It was quickened by his enemies, in the interests of 
the umreformed religion, putting in the King’s way, 
at a state dinner, a niece of the Duke of Norfolk, 
Catherine Howard, a young lady of fascinating 
manners, though small in stature and not particularly 
beautiful. Falling in love with her on the spot, the 
King soon divorced Anne of Cleves after making her 
the subject of much brutal talk, on pretence that she 
had been previously betrothed to some one else — which 
would never do for one of his dignity — and married 
Catherine. It is probable that on his wedding-day, of 
all days in the year, he sent his faithful Cromwell to 
the scaffold, and had his head struck off. He further 
celebrated the occasion by burning at one time, and 
causing to be drawn to the fire on the same hurdles,

some Protestant prisoners for denying the Pope’s doc- 
trines, and some Roman Catholic prisoners for denying 
his own supremacy. Still the people bore it, and not 
a gentleman in England raised his hand. 

But, by a just retribution, it soon came out that 
Catherine Howard, before her marriage, had been really 
guilty of such crimes as the King had falsely attributed 
to his second wife Anne Boleyn ; so, again the dreadful 
axe made the King a widower, and this Queen passed 
away as so many in that reign had passed away before 
her. As an appropriate pursuit under the circum- 
stances, Henry then applied himself to superintending 
the composition of a religious book called “ A necessary 
doctrine for any Christian Man.” He must have been 
a little confused in his mind, I think, at about this 
period ; for he was so false to himself as to be true to 
some one : that some one being Cranmer, whom the 
Duke of Norfolk and others of his enemies tried to ruin ; 
but to whom the King was steadfast, and to whom he 
one night gave his ring, charging him when he should 
find himself, next day, accused of treason, to show it to 
the council board. This, Cranmer did to the confusion 
of his enemies. I suppose the King thought he might 
want him a little longer. 

He married yet once more. Yes, strange to say, he

found in England another woman who would become 
his wife, and she was Catherine Parr, widow of Lord 
Latimer. She leaned towards the reformed religion ; 
and, it is some comfort to know, that she tormented the 
King considerably by arguing a variety of doctrinal 
points with him on all possible occasions. She had 
very nearly done this to her own destruction. After 
one of these conversations, the King in a very black 
mood actually instructed Gardiner, one of his Bishops 
who favoured the Popish opinions, to draw a bill of 
accusation against her, which would have inevitably 
brought her to the scaffold where her predecessors 
had died, but that one of her friends picked up the 
paper of instructions which had been dropped in the 
palace, and gave her timely notice. She fell ill with 
terror ; but managed the King so well when he came to 
entrap her into further statements — by saying that she 
had only spoken on such points to divert his mind and 
to get some information from his extraordinary wisdom 
— that he gave her a kiss and called her his sweetheart. 
And, when the Chancellor came next day actually to 
take her to the Tower, the King sent him about his 
business, and honoured him with the epithets of a beast, 
a knave, and a fool. So near was Catherine Parr to the 
block, and so narrow was her escape !

There was war with Scotland in this reign, and a 
short clumsy war with France for favouring Scotland ; 
but, the events at home were so dreadful, and leave 
such an enduring stain on the country, that I need say 
no more of what happened abroad. 

A few more horrors, and this reign is over. There 
was a lady, Anne Askew, in Lincolnshire, who inclined 
to the Protestant opinions, and whose husband, being 
a fierce Catholic, turned her out of his house. She 
came to London, and was considered as offending 
against the six articles, and was taken to the Tower, 
and put upon the rack — probably because it was hoped 
that she might, in her agony, criminate some obnoxious 
persons ; if falsely, so much the better. She was tor- 
tured without uttering a cry, until the Lieutenant of 
the Tower would suffer his men to torture her no more ; 
and then two priests who were present actually pulled 
off their robes, and turned the wheels of the rack with 
their own hands ; so rending and twisting and breaking 
her that she was afterwards carried to the fire in a 
chair. She was burned with three others, a gen- 
tleman, a clergyman, and a tailor ; and so the world 
went on. 

Either the King became afraid of the power of the 
Duke of Norfolk, and his son the Earl of Surrey, or

they gave him some offence, but he resolved to pull 
them down, to follow all the rest who were gone. The 
son was tried first — of course for nothing — and defended 
himself bravely ; but of course he was found guilty, and 
of course he was executed. Then his father was laid 
hold of, and left for death too. 

But the King himself was left for death by a 
Greater King, and the earth was to be rid of him at 
last. He was now a swollen, hideous spectacle, with 
a great hole in his leg, and so odious to every sense 
that it was dreadful to approach him. When he was 
found to be dying, Cranmer was sent for from his 
palace at Croydon, and came with all speed, but found 
him speechless. Happily, in that hour he perished. 
He was in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and the thirty- 
eighth of his reign. 

Henry the Eighth has been favoured by some 
Protestant writers, because the Reformation was 
achieved in his time. But the mighty merit of it 
lies with other men and not with him ; and it can be 
rendered none the worse by this monster’s crimes, and 
none the better by any defence of them. The plain 
truth is, that he was a most intolerable ruffian, a dis- 
grace to human nature, and a blot of blood and grease 
upon the History of England.

CHAPTER XXIX. 

ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SIXTH. 

Henry the Eighth had made a will, appointing a 
council of sixteen to govern the kingdom for his son 
while he was under age (he was now only ten years 
old), and another council of twelve to help them. The 
most powerful of the first council was the Earl of 
Hertford, the young King’s uncle, who lost no time 
in bringing his nephew with great state up to Enfield, 
and thence to the Tower. It was considered at the 
time a striking proof of virtue in the young King that 
he was sorry for his father’s death; but, as common 
subjects have that virtue too, sometimes, we will say 
no more about it. 

There was a curious part of the late King’s will, 
requiring his executors to fulfil whatever promises he 
had made. Some of the court wondering what these 
might be, the Earl of Hertford and the other noble- 
men interested, said that they were promises to 
advance and enrich them . So, the Earl of Hertford 
made himself Duke of Somerset, and made his 
brother Edward Seymour a baron; and there were

various similar promotions, all very agreeable to the 
parties concerned, and very dutiful, no doubt, to the 
late King’s memory. To be more dutiful still, they 
made themselves rich out of the Church lands, and 
were very comfortable. The new Duke of Somerset 
caused himself to be declared Protector of the king- 
dom, and was, indeed, the King. 

As young Edward the Sixth had been brought up 
in the principles of the Protestant religion, everybody 
knew that they would be maintained. But Cranmer, 
to whom they were chiefly entrusted, advanced them 
steadily and temperately. Many superstitious and 
ridiculous practices were stopped; but those which 
were harmless were not interfered with. 

The Duke of Somerset, the Protector, was anxious 
to have the young Kin g engaged in marriage to the 
young Queen of Scotland, in order to prevent that 
princess from m akin g an alliance with any foreign 
power; but, as a large party in Scotland were un- 
favourable to this plan, he invaded that country. His 
excuse for doing so was, that the Border men — that 
is, the Scotch who lived in that part of the country 
where England and Scotland joined — troubled the 
English very much. But there were two sides to this 
question; for the English Border men troubled the

Scotch too ; and, through many long years, there were 
perpetual border quarrels which gave rise to numbers 
of old tales and songs. However, the Protector invaded 
Scotland; and Arran, the Scottish Eegent, with an 
army twice as large as his, advanced to meet him. 
They encountered on the banks of the river Esk, 
within a few miles of Edinburgh; and there, after a 
little skirmish, the Protector made such moderate 
proposals, in offering to retire if the Scotch would 
only engage not to marry their princess to any foreign 
prince, that the Eegent thought the English were 
afraid. But in this he made a horrible mistake ; for 
the English soldiers on land, and the English sailors 
on the water, so set upon the Scotch, that they broke 
and fled, and more than ten thousand of them were 
killed. It was a dreadful battle, for the fugitives were 
slain without mercy. The ground for four miles, all 
the way to Edinburgh, was strewn with dead men, and 
with arms, and legs, and heads. Some hid themselves 
in streams and were drowned ; some threw away their 
armour and were killed running, almost naked ; but in 
this battle of Pinkey the English lost only two or 
three hundred men. They were much better clothed 
than the Scotch; at the poverty of whose appearance 
and country they were exceedingly astonished.

A Parliament was called when Somerset came back, 
and it repealed the whip with six strings, and did one 
or two other good things; though it unhappily retained 
the punishment of burning for those people who did 
not make believe to believe, in all religious matters, 
what the Government had declared that they must and 
should believe. It also made a foolish law (meant to 
put down beggars), that any man who lived idly and 
loitered about for three days together, should be 
burned with a hot iron, made a slave, and wear an iron 
fetter. But this savage absurdity soon came to an 
end, and went the way of a great many other foolish 
laws. 

The Protector was now so proud that he sat in 
Parliament before all the nobles, on the right hand of 
the throne. Many other noblemen, who only wanted 
to be as proud if they could get a chance, became his 
enemies of course; and it is supposed that he came 
back suddenly from Scotland because he had received 
news that his brother, Lord Seymour, was becoming 
dangerous to him. This lord was now High Admiral 
of England: a very handsome man, and a great 
favourite with the Court ladies — even with the young 
princess Elizabeth, who romped with him a little more 
than young princesses in these times do with any one.

He had married Catherine Parr, the late King’s widow, 
who was now dead ; and, to strengthen his power, he 
secretly supplied the young King with money. He 
may even have engaged with some of his brother’s 
enemies in a plot to carry the boy off. On these and 
other accusations, at any rate, he was confined in the 
Tower, impeached, and found guilty ; his own brother’s 
name being — unnatural and sad to tell — the first signed 
to the warrant for his execution. He was executed on 
Tower Hill, and died denying his treason. One of 
his last proceedings in this world was to write two 
letters : one to the Princess Elizabeth, and one to the 
Princess Mary : which a servant of his took charge of, 
and concealed in his shoe. These letters are supposed 
to have urged them against his brother, and to revenge 
his death. What they truly contained is not known ; 
but there is no doubt that he had, at one time, obtained 
great influence over the Princess Elizabeth. 

All this while, the Protestant religion was making 
progress. The images which the people had gradually 
come to worship, were removed from the churches; 
the people were informed that they need not confess 
themselves to priests unless they chose; a common 
prayer-book was drawn up in the English language, 
which all could understand ; and many other improve-

ments were made ; still moderately. For Cranmer was 
a very moderate man, and even restrained the Pro- 
testant clergy from violently abusing the unreformed 
religion — as they very often did, and which was not a 
good example. But the people were at this time ini 
great distress. The rapacious nobility who had come 
into possession of the Church lands, were very had 
landlords. They inclosed great quantities of ground 
for the feeding of sheep, which was then more profit- 
able than the growing of crops ; and this increased the 
general distress. So the people, who still understood 
little of what was going on about them, and still readily 
believed what the homeless monks told them — many 
of whom had been their good friends in their better 
days — took it into their heads, that all this was owing 
to the reformed religion, and therefore rose in many 
parts of the country. 

The most powerful risings were in Devonshire and 
Norfolk. In Devonshire, the rebellion was so strong 
that ten thousand men united within a few days, and 
even laid siege to Exeter. But Lord Russell, coming 
to the assistance of the citizens who defended that 
town, defeated the rebels ; and, not only hanged the 
Mayor of one place, hut hanged the vicar of another 
from his own church steeple. What with hanging and

killing by the sword, four thousand of the rebels are 
supposed to have fallen in that one county. In Nor- 
folk (where the rising was more against the inclosure 
of open lands than against the reformed religion), 
the popular leader was a man named Robert Ret, 
a tanner of Wymondham. The mob were, in the first 
instance, excited against the tanner by one John 
Flowerdew, a gentleman who owed him a grudge: 
but, the tanner was more than a match for the gentle- 
man, since he soon got the people on his side, and 
established himself near Norwich with quite an army. 
There was a large oak-tree in that place, on a spot 
called Moushold Hill, which Ret named the Tree of 
Reformation ; and under its green boughs, he and his 
men sat, in the midsummer weather, holding courts 
of justice and debating affairs of state. They were 
even impartial enough to allow some rather tiresome 
public speakers to get up into this Tree of Reforma- 
tion, and point out their errors to them, in long dis- 
courses, while they lay listening (not always without 
some grumbling and growling) in the shade below. At 
last, one sunny July day, a herald appeared below 
the tree, and proclaimed Ret and all his men traitors, 
unless from that moment they dispersed and went 
home : in which case they were to receive a pardon.

But, Ket and his men made light of the herald and 
became stronger than ever; until the Earl of Warwick 
went after them with a sufficient force, and cut them 
all to pieces. A few were hanged, drawn, and quar- 
tered as traitors, and their limbs were sent into various 
country places to be a terror to the people. Nine of 
them were hanged upon nine green branches of the 
Oak of Reformation ; and so, for the time, that tree may 
be said to have withered away. 

The Protector, though a haughty man, had compas- 
sion for the real distresses of the common people, 
and a sincere desire to help them. But he was too 
proud and too high in degree to hold even their favour 
steadily; and many of the nobles always envied and 
hated him, because they were as proud and not as 
high as he. He was at this time building a great 
Palace in the Strand; to get the stone for which he 
blew up chtirch steeples with gunpowder, and pulled 
down bishops* houses : thus making himself still more 
disliked. At length, his principal enemy, the Earl 
of Warwick— Dudley by name, and the son of that 
Dudley who had made himself so odious with Empson, 
in the reign of Henry the Seventh — joined with seven 
other members of the Council against him, formed 

a separate Council; and, becoming stronger in a few

days, sent him to the Tower under twenty-nine articles 
of accusation. After being sentenced by the Council 
to the forfeiture of all his offices and lands, he was 
liberated and pardoned, on making a very humble 
submission. He was even taken back into the Council 
again, after having suffered this fall, and married his 
daughter, Lady Anne Seymour, to Warwick’s eldest 
son. But such a reconciliation was little likely to last, 
and did not outlive a year. Warwick, having got 
himself made Duke of Northumberland, and having 
advanced the more important of his friends, then 
finished the history by causing the Duke of Somerset 
and his friend Lord Grey, and others, to be arrested 
for treason, in having conspired to seize and dethrone 
the King. They were also accused of having intended 
to seize the new Duke of Northumberland, with his 
friends Lord Northampton and Lord Pembroke; 
to murder them if they found need ; and to raise the 
City to revolt. All this the fallen Protector positively 
denied ; except that he confessed to having spoken of 
the murder of those three noblemen, but having never 
designed it. He was acquitted of the charge of 
treason, and found guilty of the other charges; so 
when the people — who remembered his having been 
their friend, now that he was disgraced and in danger.

saw him come out from his trial with the axe turned 
from him — they thought he was altogether acquitted, 
and set up a loud shout of joy. 

But the Duke of Somerset was ordered to be 
beheaded on Tower Hill, at eight o’clock in the morn- 
ing, and proclamations were issued bidding the citizens 
keep at home until after ten. They filled the streets, 
however, and crowded the place of execution as soon 
as it was light ; and, with sad faces and sad hearts, 
saw the once powerful Protector ascend the scaffold 
to lay his head upon the dreadful block. While he was 
yet saying his last words to them with manly courage, 
and telling them, in particular, how it comforted him, 
at that pass, to have assisted in reforming the national 
religion, a member of the Council was seen riding up 
on horseback. They again thought that the Duke was 
saved by his bringing a reprieve, and again shouted 
for joy. But the Duke himself told them they were 
mistaken, and laid down his head and had it struck 
off at a blow. 

Many of the bystanders rushed forward and steeped 
their handkerchiefs in his blood, as a mark of their 
affection. He had, indeed, been capable of many 
good acts, and one of them was discovered after he 
was no more. The Bishop of Durham, a very good

man, had been informed against to the Council, when 
the Duke was in power, as having answered a 
treacherous letter proposing a rebellion against the 
reformed religion. As the answer could not be found, 
he could not be declared guilty ; but it was now dis- 
covered, hidden by the Duke himself among some 
private papers, in his regard for that good man. 
The Bishop lost his office, and was deprived of his 
possessions. 

It is not very pleasant to know that while his uncle 
lay in prison under sentence of death, the young King 
was being vastly entertained by plays, and dances, and 
sham fights : but there is no doubt of it, for he kept 
a journal himself. It is pleasanter to know that not 
a single Roman Catholic was burnt in this* reign for 
holding that religion; though two wretched victims 
suffered for heresy. One, a woman named Joan 
Bocher, for professing some opinions that even she 
could only explain in unintelligible jargon. The other, 
a Dutchman, named Yon Pares, who practised as a 
surgeon in London. Edward was, to his credit, 
exceedingly unwilling to sign the warrant for the 
woman’s execution : shedding tears before he did so, 
and telling Cranmer, who urged him to it (though 
Cranmer really would have spared the woman at first,

but for her own determined obstinacy), that the guilt 
was not his; but that of the man who so strongly 
urged the dreadful act. We shall see, too soon, 
whether the time ever came when Cranmer is likely 
to have remembered this with sorrow and remorse. 

Cranmer and Bidley (at first Bishop of Bochester, 
and afterwards Bishop of London) were the most 
powerful of the clergy of this reign. Others were 
imprisoned and deprived of their property for still 
adhering to the unreformed religion; the most im- 
portant among whom were Gardiner Bishop of 
Winchester, Heath Bishop of Worcester, Day Bishop 
of Chichester, and Bonner that Bishop of London 
who was superseded by Bidley. The Princess Mary, 
who inherited her mother’s gloomy temper, and hated 
the reformed religion as connected with her mother’s 
wrongs and sorrows-^she knew nothing else about it, 
always refusing to read a single book in which it was 
truly described — held by the unreformed religion too, 
and was the only person in the kingdom for whom 
the old Mass was allowed to be performed ; nor would 
the young King have made that exception even in her 
favor, but for the strong persuasions of Cranmer 
and Bidley. He always viewed it with horror; and 
when he fell into a sickly condition, after having been

very ill, first of the measles and then of the small-pox, 
he was greatly troubled in mind to think that if he 
died, and she, the next heir to the throne, succeeded, 
the Koman Catholic religion would be set up again. 

This uneasiness, the Duke of Northumberland was 
not slow to encourage : for, if the Princess Mary came 
to the throne, he, who had taken part with the Protes- 
tants, was sure to be disgraced. Now, the Duchess 
of Suffolk was descended from King Henry the 
Seventh; and, if she resigned what little or no right 
she had, in favor of her daughter Lady Jane Grey, 
that would be the succession to promote the Duke’s 
greatness; because Lord Guilford Dudley, one of 
his sons, was, at this very time, newly married to her. 
So, he worked upon the King’s fears, and persuaded 
him to set aside both the Princess Mary and, the 
Princess Elizabeth, and assert his right to appoint 
his successor. Accordingly the young King handed 
to the Crown lawyers a writing signed half-a-dozen 
times over by himself, appointing Lady Jane Grey to 
succeed to the Crown, and requiring them to have his 
will made out according to law. They were much 
against it at first, and told the King so ; but the Duke 
of Northumberland — being so violent about it that the 
\ lawyers even expected him to beat them ; and, hotly

declaring that stripped to his shirt he would fight any 
man in such a quarrel — they yielded. Cranmer, also, 
at first hesitated ; pleading that he had sworn to 
maintain the succession of the Crown to the Princess 
Mary; but, he was a weak man in his resolutions, 
and afterwards signed the document with the rest of 
the council. 

It was completed none too soon ; for Edward was 
now sinking in a rapid decline ; and, by way of making 
him better, they handed him over to a woman-doctor 
who pretended to be able to cure it. He speedily got 
worse. On the sixth of July, in the year one thousand 
five hundred and fifty-three, he died, very peaceably 
and piously; praying God, with his last breath, to 
protect the reformed religion. 

This King died in the sixteenth year of his age, and 
in the seventh of his reign. It is difficult to judge 
what the character of one so young might afterwards 
have become among so many bad, ambitious, quar- 
relling nobles. But, he was an amiable hoy, of very 
good abilities, and had nothing coarse or cruel or 
brutal in his disposition — which in the son of such a 
father is rather surprising.

CHAPTER XXX. 

ENGLAND UNDER MARY. 

The Duke of Northumberland was very anxious to 
keep the young King’s death a secret, in order that he 
might get the two Princesses into his power. But, the 
Princess Mary, being informed of that event as she 
was on her way to London to see her sick brother, 
turned her horse's head, and rode away into Norfolk. 
The Earl of Arundel was her friend, and it was he 
who sent her warning of what had happened. 

As the secret could not be kept, the Duke of 
Northumberland and the Council sent for the Lord 
Mayor of London and some of the aldermen, and made 
a merit of telling it to them. Then, they made it 
known to the people, and set off to inform Lady Jane 
Grey that she was to be Queen. 

She was a pretty girl of only sixteen, and was 
amiable, learned, and clever. When the lords who 
came to her, fell on their knees before her, and told 
her what tidings they brought, she was so astonished 
that she fainted. On recovering, she expressed her 
sorrow for the young King’s death, and said that she

knew she was unfit to govern the kingdom ; but that if 
she must be Queen, she prayed God to direct her. 
She was then at Sion House, near Brentford ; and the 
lords took her down the river in state to the Tower, 
that she might remain there (as the custom was) until 
she was crowned. But the people were not at all 
favorable to Lady Jane, considering that the right to 
be Queen was Mary's, and greatly disliking the Duke 
of Northumberland. They were not put into a better 
humour by the Duke’s causing a vintner’s servant, one 
Gabriel Pot, to be taken up for expressing his dis- 
satisfaction among the crowd, and to have his ears 
nailed to the pillory, and cut off. Some powerful men 
among the nobility declared on Mary’s side. They 
raised troops to support her cause, had her proclaimed 
Queen at Norwich, and gathered around her at the 
castle of Framlingham, which belonged to the Duke 
of Norfolk. For she was not considered so safe as 
yet, but that it was best to keep her in a castle on the 
sea-coast, from whence she might be sent abroad, if 
necessary. 

The Council would have despatched Lady Jane’s 
father, the Duke of Suffolk, as the general of the army 
against this force; but, as Lady Jane implored that 
her father might remain with her, and as he was

known to be but a weak man, they told the Duke of 
Northumberland that he must take the command 
himself. He was not very ready to do so, as he mis- 
trusted the Council much ; but there was no help for it, 
and he set forth with a heavy heart : observing to a 
lord who rode beside him through Shoreditch at the 
head of the troops, that, although the people pressed 
in great numbers to look at them, they were terribly 
silent. 

And his fears for himself turned out to be true. 
While he was waiting at Cambridge for further help 
from the Council, the Council took it into their heads 
to turn their backs on Lady Jane’s cause, and to take 
up the Princess Mary’s. This was chiefly owing to 
the before-mentioned Earl of Arundel ; who represented 
to the Lord Mayor and aldermen, in a second interview 
with those sagacious persons, that, as for himself, he 
did not perceive the Reformed religion to be in much 
danger — which Lord Pembroke backed by flourishing 
his sword as another kind of persuasion. The Lord 
Mayor and aldermen, thus enlightened, said there 
could be no doubt that the Princess Mary ought to be 
Queen. So, she was proclaimed at the Cross by St. 
Paul’s, and barrels of wine were given to the people*; 
and they got very drunk, and danced round blazing

bonfires — little thinking, poor wretches, what other 
bonfires would soon be blazing in Queen Mary’s name. 

After a ten days’ dream of royalty, Lady Jane Grey 
resigned the Crown with great willingness ; saying that 
she had only accepted it in obedience to her father and 
mother; and went gladly back to her pleasant house 
by the river, and her books. Mary then came on 
towards London; and at Wanstead in Essex, was 
joined by her half sister, the Princess Elizabeth. 
They passed through the streets of London to the 
Tower, and there the new Queen met some eminent 
prisoners then confined in it, kissed them, and gave 
them their liberty. Among these was that Gardiner, 
Bishop of Winchester ; who had been imprisoned in 
the last reign for holding to the unreformed religion. 
Him she soon made chancellor. 

The Duke of Northumberland had been taken 
prisoner; and, together with his son and five others, 
was quickly brought before the Council. He, not un- 
naturally, asked that Council, in his defence, whether 
it was treason to obey orders that had been issued 
under the great seal ; and, if it were, whether they, who 
had obeyed them too, ought to be his judges ? But 
they made light of these points ; and, being resolved 
to have him out of the way, soon sentenced him to

death. He had risen into power upon the death of 
another man, and made but a poor show (as might be 
expected) when he himself lay low. He entreated 
Gardiner to let him live, if it were only in a mouse’s 
hole; and, when he ascended the scaffold to be 
beheaded on Tower Hill, addressed the people in a 
miserable way; saying that he had been incited by 
others, and exhorting them to return to the unreformed 
religion, which he told them was his faith. There 
seems reason to suppose that he expected a pardon 
even then, in return for this confession ; but it matters 
little whether he did or not. His head was struck off; 
and Sir John Gates and Sir Thomas Palmer, two 
better and more manly gentlemen, suffered with him. 

Mary was now crowned Queen. She was thirty- 
seven years of age, short and thin, wrinkled in the 
face, and very unhealthy. But she had a great liking 
for show and for bright colours, and all the ladies of 
her Court were magnificently dressed. She had a 
great liking too for old customs, without much sense 
in them; and she was oiled in the oldest way, and 
blessed in the oldest way, and done all manner of 
things to in the oldest way, at her coronation. I hope 
they did her good. 

She soon began to show her desire to put down the

Reformed religion, and put up the unreformed one: 
though it was dangerous work as yet, the people being 
something wiser than they used to be. They even cast 
a shower of stones — and among them a dagger — at one 
of the royal chaplains who attacked the Reformed 
religion in a public sermon. But the Queen and 
her priests went steadily on. Ridley, the powerful 
bishop of the last reign, was seized and sent to the 
Tower. Latimer, also a celebrated prelate of the last 
reign, was likewise sent to the Tower ; and Cranmer 
speedily followed. Latimer was an aged man ; and, as 
his guards took him through Smithfield, he looked 
round it, and said, “ This is a place that hath long 
groaned for me.” For he knew well, what kind of 
bonfires would soon be burning. Nor was the know- 
ledge confined to him. The prisons were fast filled 
with the chief Protestants ; who were there left rotting 
in darkness, hunger, dirt, and separation from their 
friends ; many, who had time left them for escape, fled 
from the kingdom ; and the dullest of the people began, 
now, to see what was coming. 

It came on fast. A Parliament was got together; 
not without strong suspicion of unfairness, and they 
annulled the divorce, formerly pronounced by Cranmer 
between the Queen’s mother and King Henry the

Eighth, and unmade all the laws on the subject of 
religion that had been made in the last King Edward’s 
reign. They began their proceedings, in violation of 
the law, by having the old mass said before them in 
Latin, and by turning out a bishop who would not 
kneel down. They also declared guilty of treason 
Lady Jane Grey, for aspiring to the Crown, her 
husband, for being her husband, and Cranmer, for not 
believing in the mass aforesaid. They then prayed 
the Queen graciously to choose a husband for herself, 
as soon as might be. 

Now, the question who should be the Queen’s 
husband had given rise to a great deal of discussion, 
and to several contending parties. Some said Cardinal 
Pole was the man — but the Queen was of opinion that 
he was not the man; being too old. and too much of 
a student. Others said that the gallant young 
Courtenay, whom the Queen had made Earl of 
Devonshire, was the man — and the Queen thought so 
too, for a while ; but she changed her mind. At last it 
appeared that Philip, Prince of Spain, was certainly 
the man — though certainly not the people’s man ; for 
they detested the idea of such a marriage from the 
beginning to the end, and murmured that the Spaniard 
would establish in England, by the aid of foreign

soldiers, the worst abuses of the Popish religion, and 
even the terrible Inquisition itself. 

These discontents gave rise to a conspiracy for 
marrying young Courtenay to the Princess Elizabeth, 
and setting them up, with popular tumults all over the 
kingdom, against the Queen. This was ffis$>Yered in 
time by Gardiner; but in Kent, the old bold county, 
the people rose in their old bold way. Sir Thomas 
Wyat, a man of great daring, was their leader. He 
raised his standard at Maidstone, marched on to 
Rochester, established himself in the old castle there, 
and prepared to hold out against the Duke of Norfolk ; 
who came against him with a part of the Queen’s 
guards and a body of five hundred London men. The 
London men, however, were all for Elizabeth, and not 
at all for Mary. They declared, under the castle walls, 
for Wyat ; the Duke retreated ; and Wyat came on to 
Deptford, at the head of fifteen thousand men. 

But these, in their turn, fell away. When he came 
to Southwark, there were only two thousand left. Not 
dismayed by finding the London citizens in arms, and 
the guns at the Tower ready to oppose his crossing the 
river there, Wyat led them off to Kingston-upon-Thames, 
intending to cross the bridge that he knew to be in 

that place, and so to work his way round to Ludgate,

one of the old gates of the City. He found the bridge 
broken down, but mended it, came across, and 
bravely fought his way up Fleet Street to Ludgate 
Hill. Finding the gate closed against him, he fought 
his way back again, sword in hand, to Temple Bar. 
Here, being overpowered, he surrendered himself, and 
three or four hundred of his men were taken, besides a 
hundred killed. Wyat, in a moment of weakness (and 
perhaps of torture) was afterwards made to accuse the 
Princess Elizabeth as his accomplice to some very 
small extent. But his manhood soon returned to him, 
and he refused to save his life by making any more 
false confessions. He was quartered and distributed 
in the usual brutal way, and from fifty to a hundred of 
his followers were hanged. The rest were led out, 
with halters round their necks, to be pardoned, and to 
make a parade of crying out, “God save Queen Mary!” 

In the danger of this rebellion* the Queen showed 
herself to be a woman of courage and spirit. She 
disdained to retreat to any place of safety, and went 
down to the Guildhall, sceptre in hand, and made a 
gallant speech to the Lord Mayor and citizens. But 
on the day after Wyat’s defeat, she did the most cruel 
act, even of her cruel reign, in signing the warrant for 
the execution of Lady Jane Grey.

They tried to persuade Lady Jane to accept the 
unreformed religion ; but she steadily refused. On the 
morning when she was to die, she saw from her window 
the bleeding and headless body of her husband, 
brought back in a cart from the scaffold on Tower Hill 
where he had laid down his life. But, as she had 
declined to see him before his execution, lest she 
should be overpowered and not make a good end, so, 
she even now showed a constancy and calmness that 
will never be forgotten. She came up to the scaffold 
with a firm step and a quiet face, and addressed the 
bystanders in a steady voice. They were not numerous ; 
for she was too young, too innocent and fair, to be 
murdered before the people on Tower Hill, as her hus- 
band had just been ; so, the place of her execution was 
within the Tower itself. She said that she had done an 
unlawful act in taking what was Queen Mary’s right; but 
that she had done so with no bad intent, and that she 
died a humble Christian. She begged the executioner 
to despatch her quickly, and she asked him, “Will 
you take my head off before I lay me down ? ” He 
answered, “ No, Madam,” and then she was very quiet 
while they bandaged her eyes. Being blinded, and 
unable to see the block on which she was to lay her 

young head, she was seen to feel about for it with her

hands, and was heard to say, confused, “ O what shall 
I do ! Where is it ? ” Then they guided her to the 
right place, and the executioner struck off her head. 
You know too well, now, what dreadful deeds the 
executioner did in England, through many, many 
years, and how his axe descended on the hateful block 
through the necks of some of the bravest, wisest, and 
best in the land. But it never struck so cruel and so 
vile a blow as this. 

The father of Lady Jane soon followed, but was 
little pitied. Queen Mary’s next object was to lay 
hold of Elizabeth, and this was pursued with great 
eagerness. Five hundred men were sent to her retired 
house at Ashridge, by Berkhampstead, with orders to 
bring her up, alive or dead. They got there at ten at 
night, when she was sick in bed. But, their leaders 
followed her lady into her bedchamber, whence she 
was brought out betimes next morning, and put into 
a litter to be conveyed to London. She was so weak 
and ill, that she was five days on the road ; still, she 
was so resolved to be seen by the people that she had 
the curtains of the litter opened ; and so, very pale and 
sickly, passed through the streets. She wrote to her 
sister, saying she was innocent of any crime, and ask- 
ing why she was made a prisoner; but she got no

answer, and was ordered to the Tower. They took her 
in by the Traitor’s Gate, to which she objected, but in 
vain. One of the lords who conveyed her offered to 
cover her with his cloak, as it was raining, but she put 
it away from her, proudly and scornfully, and passed 
into the Tower, and sat down in a court-yard on a 
stone. They besought her to come in out of the wet ; 
but she answered that it was better sitting there, than 
in a worse place. At length she went to her apart- 
ment, where she was kept a prisoner, though not so 
close a prisoner as at Woodstock, whither she was 
afterwards removed, and where she is said to have one 
day envied a milkmaid whom she heard singing in 
the sunshine as she went through the green fields. 
Gardiner, than whom there were not many worse men 
among the fierce and sullen priests, cared little to keep 
secret his stern desire for her death: being used to 
say that it was of little service to shake off the leaves, 
and lop the branches of the tree of heresy, if its root, 
the hope of heretics, were left. He failed, however, 
in his benevolent design. Elizabeth was, at length, 
released ; and Hatfield House was assigned to her as a 
residence, under the care of one Sm Thomas Pope. 

It would seem that Philip, the Prince of Spain, was 
a main cause of this change in Elizabeth’s fortunes.

He was not an amiable man, being, on the contrary, 
proud, overbearing and gloomy ; but he and the Spanish 
lords who came over with him, assuredly did dis- 
countenance the idea of doing any violence to the 
Princess. It may have been prudent, but we will 
hope it was manly and honourable. The Queen had 
been expecting her husband with great impatience, 
and at length he came, to her great joy, though he 
never cared much for her. They were married by 
Gardiner, at Winchester, and there was more holiday- 
making among the people; but they had their old 
distrust of this Spanish marriage, in which even the 
Parliament shared. Though they were far from 
honest, and were strongly suspected to have been 
bought with Spanish money, they would pass no bill 
to enable the Queen to set aside the Princess Elizabeth 
and appoint her own successor. 

Although Gardiner failed in this object, as well as 
in the darker one of bringing the Princess to the 
scaffold, he went on, at a great pace, in the revival of 
the unreformed religion. A new Parliament was 
packed, in which there were no Protestants. Pre- 
parations were made to receive Cardinal Pole in 
England as the Pope’s messenger, bringing his holy 
declaration that all the nobility who had acquired

Church property, should keep it — which was done to 
enlist their selfish interest on the Pope’s side. Then 
a great scene was enacted, which was the triumph of 
the Queen’s plans. Cardinal Pole arrived with great 
splendour and dignity, and was received with great 
pomp. The Parliament joined in a petition expressive 
of their sorrow at the change in the national religion, 
and praying him to receive the country again into the 
Popish Church. With the Queen sitting on her throne, 
and the King on one side of her, and the Cardinal on 
the other, and the Parliament present; Gardiner read 
the petition aloud. The Cardinal then made a great 
speech, and was so obliging as to say that all was 
forgotten and forgiven, and that the kingdom was 
solemnly made Roman Catholic again. 

Everything was now ready for the lighting of the 
terrible bonfires. The Queen having declared to the 
Council, in writing, that she would wish none of her 
subjects to be burnt without some of the Council being 
present, and that she would particularly wish there to 
be good sermons at all burnings, the Council knew 
pretty well what was to be done next. So, after the 
Cardinal had blessed all the bishops as a preface to 
the burnings, the Chancellor Gardiner opened a High 
Court at Saint Mary Overy, on the Southwark side of

London Bridge, for the trial of heretics. Here, two of 
the late bishops, Hooper and Rogers, who had been 
already unjustly and violently examined before, the 
Council, were brought to be tried. Hooper was tried 
first for being married, though a priest, and for not 
believing in the mass. He admitted both of these 
accusations, and said that the mass was a wicked 
imposition. Then they tried Rogers, who said the 
same. Next morning the two were brought up to be 
sentenced ; and then Rogers said that his poor wife, 
being a German woman and a stranger in the land, 
he hoped might be allowed to come to speak to 
him before he died. To this the inhuman Gardiner 
replied, that she was not his wife. “ Yea, but she is, 
my lord,” said Rogers, “ and she hath been my wife 
these eighteen years.” His request was still refused, 
and they were both sent to Newgate; all those who 
stood in the streets to sell things, being ordered to put 
out their lights that the people might not see them. 
But, the people stood at their doors with candles in 
their hands, and prayed for them as they went by. 
Soon afterwards, Rogers was taken out of jail to be 
burnt in Smithfield ; and, in the crowd as he went along, 
he saw his poor wife and his ten children, of whom the 
youngest was a little baby. And so he was burnt to death.

The next day, Hooper, who was to be burnt at Glou- 
cester, was brought out to take his last journey, and 
was made to wear a hood over his face that he might 
not be known by the people. But, they did know him 
for all that, down in his own part of the country ; and, 
when he came near Gloucester, they lined the road, 
making prayers and lamentations. His guards took 
him to a lodging, where he slept soundly all night ; and, 
at nine o’clock next morning, was brought forth leaning 
on a staff ; for he had taken cold in prison, and was 
infirm. The iron stake, and the iron chain which was 
to bind him to it, were fixed up near a great elm-tree 
in a pleasant open place before the cathedral ; where, on 
peaceful Sundays, he had been accustomed to preach 
and to pray, when he was bishop of Gloucester. This 
tree, which had no leaves then, it being February, was 
filled with people ; and the priests of Gloucester College 
were looking complacently on from a window, and there 
was a great concourse of spectators in every spot from 
which a glimpse of the dreadful sight could be beheld. 
When the old man kneeled down on the small platform 
at the foot of the stake, and prayed aloud, the nearest 
people were observed to be so attentive to his prayers 
that they were ordered to stand further back ; for it did 
hot suit the Romish Church to have those Protestant

words heard. His prayers concluded, he went up to 
the stake and was stripped to his shirt, -and chained 
ready for the fire. One of his guards had such com- 
passion on him that, to shorten his agonies, he tied 
some packets of gunpowder about him. Then they 
heaped up wood and straw and reeds, and set them all 
alight. But, unhappily, the wood was green and damp, 
and there was a wind blowing that blew what flame 
there was, away. Thus, through three quarters of an 
hour, the good old man was scorched and roasted and 
smoked, as the fire rose and sank; and all that 
time they saw him, as he burned, moving his lips 
in prayer, and beating his breast with one hand, 
even after the other was burnt away and had 
fallen off. 

Cranmer, Bidley, and Latimer were taken to Oxford 
to dispute with a commission of priests and doctors 
about the mass. They were shamefully treated ; and it 
is recorded that the Oxford scholars hissed and howled 
and groaned, and misconducted themselves in an any- 
thing but scholarly way— which, of course, they have 
never done, on any public occasion, since. The pri- 
soners were taken back to jail, and afterwards tried in 
St. Mary’s Church. They were all found guilty. On 
the sixteenth of the month of October, Bidley and

Latimer were brought out, to make another of the 
dreadful bonfires. 

The scene of the suffering of these two good Pro- 
testant men was in the City ditch, near Baliol College. 
On coming to the dreadful spot, they kissed the stakes, 
and then embraced each other. And then a learned 
doctor got up into a pulpit which was placed there, and 
preached a sermon from the text, “ Though I give my 
body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth 
me nothing.” When you think of the charity of burning 
men alive, you may imagine that this learned doctor 
had a rather brazen face. Ridley would have answered 
his sermon when it came to an end, but was not allowed. 
When Latimer was stripped, it appeared that he had 
dressed himself under his other clothes, in a new 
shroud ; and, as he stood in it before all the people, it 
was noted of him, and long remembered, that, whereas 
he had been stooping and feeble but a few minutes 
before, he now stood upright and handsome, in the 
knowledge that he was dying for a just and a great 
cause. Ridley’s brother-in-law was there, with bags of 
gunpowder ; and when they were both chained up, he 
tied them round their bodies. Then, a light was 
thrown upon the pile to fire it. “ Be of good comfort, 
Master Ridley,” said Latimer, at that awful moment,

“ and play the man ! We shall this day light such a 
candle, by God’s grace, in England, as I trust shall 
never be put out.” And then he was seen to make 
motions with his hands as if he were washing them in 
the flames, and to stroke his aged face with them, and 
was heard to cry, “ Father of Heaven, receive my soul! ” 
He died quickly, but the fire, after having burned the 
legs of Ridley, sunk. There he lingered chained to 
the iron post, and crying, “ O ! I cannot bum! O ! for 
Christ’s sake let the fire come unto me ! ” And still, 
when his brother-in-law had heaped on more wood, he 
was heard through the blinding smoke, still dismally 
crying, “O! I cannot burn, I cannot burn ! ” At last, 
the gunpowder caught fire, and ended his miseries. 

Five days after this fearful scene, Gardiner went to 
his tremendous account before God, for the cruelties 
he had so much assisted in committing. 

Cranmer remained still alive and in prison. He was 
brought out again in February, for more examining 
and trying, by Bonner, bishop of London : another man 
of blood, who had succeeded to Gardiner’s work, even 
in his life-time, when Gardiner was tired of it. 
Cranmer was now degraded as a priest, and left for 
death ; but, if the Queen hated any one on earth, she 
hated him, and it was resolved that he should be ruined

and disgraced to the utmost. There is no doubt that 
the Queen and her husband personally urged on these 
deeds, because they wrote to the Council, urging them 
to be active in the kindling of the fearful fires. As 
Cranmer was known not to be a firm man, a plan was 
laid for surrounding him with artful people, and induc- 
ing him to recant to the unreformed religion. Deans 
and friars visited him, played at howls with him, showed 
him various attentions, talked persuasively with him, 
gave him money for his prison comforts, and induced 
him to sign, I fear, as many as six recantations. But 
when, after all, he was taken out to he burnt, he was 
nobly true to his better self, and made a glorious end. 

After prayers and a sermon, Dr. Cole, the preacher 
of the day (who had been one of the artful priests about 
Cranmer in prison), required him to make a public con- 
fession of his faith before the people. This, Cole did, 
expecting that he would declare himself a Roman 
Catholic. “ I will make a profession of my faith,” said 
Cranmer, “ and with a good will too.” 

Then, he arose before them all, and took from the 
sleeve of his robe a written prayer and read it aloud. 
That done, he kneeled and said the Lord’s Prayer, all 
the people joining ; and then he arose again and told 
them that he believed in the Bible, and that in what he

had lately written, he had written what was not the 
truth ; and, because his hand had signed those papers, 
he would burn his right hand first when he came to 
the fire. As for the Pope, he did refuse him and de- 
nounce him as the enemy of Heayen. Hereupon the 
pious Dr. Cole cried out to the guards to stop that 
heretic’s mouth and take him away. 

So they took him away, and chained him to the stake, 
where he hastily took off his own clothes to make ready 
for the flames, and stood before them with a bald head 
and a white and flowing beard. He was so firm now, 
when the worst was come, that he again declared 
against his recantation, and was so impressive and so 
undismayed, that a certain lord, who was one of the 
directors of the execution, called out to the men to 
make haste ! When the fire was lighted, Cranmer, 
true to his latest words, stretched out his right hand, 
and crying out, “ This hand hath offended ! ” held it 
out among the flames, until it blazed and burned away. 
His heart was found entire among his ashes, and he 
left at last a memorable name in English history. 
Cardinal Pole celebrated the day by saying his first 
mass, and next day he was made Archbishop of Canter- 
bury in Cranmer’s place. 

The Queen’s husband, who was now mostly abroad

in his own dominions, and generally made a coarse jest 
of her to his more familiar courtiers, was at war with 
France, and came over to seek the assistance of Eng- 
land. England was very unwilling to engage in a 
French war for his sake; but it happened that the 
King of France, at this very time, aided a descent upoh 
the English coast. Hence, war was declared, greatly 
to Philip’s satisfaction; and the Queen raised a sum of 
money with which to carry it on, by every unjustifiable 
means in her power. It met with no profitable re- 
turn, for the French Duke of Guise surprised Calais, 
and the English sustained a complete defeat. The 
losses they met with in France greatly mortified 
the national pride, and the Queen never recovered 
the blow. 

There was a bad fever raging in England at this time, 
and I am glad to write that the Queen took it, and the 
hour of her death came. “ When I am dead and my 
body is opened,” she said to those around her, " ye 
shall find Calais written on my heart.” I should have 
thought, if anything were written on it, they would 
have found the words — Jane Grey, Hooper, Rogers, 
Ridley, Latimer, Cranmer, and three hundred

children. But it is enough that their deaths were 
written in Heaven. 

The Queen died on the seventeenth of November, 
fifteen hundred and fifty-eight, after reigning not quite 
five years and a half, and in the forty-fourth year of her 
age. Cardinal Pole died of the same fever next day. 

As Bloody Queen Mary, this woman has become 
famous, and as Bloody Queen Mary, she will ever be 
justly remembered with horror and detestation in Great 
Britain. Her memory has been held in such abhor- 
rence that some writers have arisen in later years to 
take her part, and to shew that she was, upon the whole, 
quite an amiable and cheerful sovereign ! “ By their 

fruits ye shall know them,’ , said Our Saviour. The 
stake and the fire were the fruits of this reign, and you 
will judge this Queen by nothing else. 


CHAPTER XXXI. 

ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. 

There was great rejoicing all over the land when 
the Lords of the Council went down to Hatfield, to 
hail the Princess Elizabeth as the new Queen of

England. Weary of the barbarities of Mary’s reign, 
the people looked with hope and gladness to the new 
Sovereign. The nation seemed to wake from a hor- 
rible dream; and Heaven, so long hidden by the 
smoke of the fires that roasted men and women to 
death, appeared to brighten once more. 

Queen Elizabeth was five-and-twenty years of age 
when she rode through the streets of London, from 
the Tower to Westminster Abbey, to be crowned. Her 
countenance was strongly marked, but on the whole, 
commanding and dignified ; her hair was red, and her 
nose something too long and sharp for a woman’s. 
She was not the beautiful creature her courtiers made 
out ; but she was well enough, and no doubt looked 
all the better for coming after the dark and gloomy 
Mary. She was well educated, but a roundabout 
writer, and rather a hard swearer and coarse talker. 
She was clever, but cunning and deceitful, and in- 
herited much of her father’s violent temper. I mention 
this now, because she has been so over-praised by 
one party, and so over-abused by another, that it is 
hardly possible to understand the greater part of her 
reign without first understanding what kind of woman 
she really was. 

She began her reign with the great advantage of

having a very wise and careful Minister, Sir William 
Cecil; whom she afterwards made Lord Burleigh. 
Altogether, the people had greater reason for rejoicing 
than they usually had, when there were processions 
in the streets ; and they were happy with some reason. 
All kinds of shows and images were set up ; Gog and 
Magog were hoisted to the top of Temple Bar ; and 
(which was more to the purpose) the Corporation 
dutifully presented the young Queen with the sum of 
a thousand marks in gold — so heavy a present, that 
she was obliged to take it into her carriage with both 
hands. The coronation was a great success ; and, on 
the next day, one of the courtiers presented a petition 
to the new Queen, praying that as it was the custom 
to release some prisoners on such occasions, she would 
have the goodness to release the four Evangelists, 
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and also the Apostle 
Saint Paul, who had been for some time shut up in a 
strange language so that the people could not get at them. 

To this, the Queen replied that it would be better 
first to inquire of themselves whether they desired to 
be released or not ; and, as a means of finding out, a 
great public discussion — a sort of religious tournament 
— was appointed to take place between certain cham- 
pions of the two religions, in Westminster Abbey.

You may suppose that it was soon made pretty clear 
to common sense, that for people to benefit by what 
they repeat or read, it is rather necessary that they 
should understand something about it. Accordingly, 
a Church Service in plain English was settled, and 
other laws and regulations were made, completely 
establishing the great work of the Reformation. The 
Romish bishops and champions were not harshly 
dealt with, all things considered; and the Queen’s 
Ministers were both prudent and merciful. 

The one great trouble of this reign, and the unfor- 
tunate cause of the greater part of such turmoil and 
bloodshed as occurred in it, was Mary Stuart, Queen 
of Scots. We will try to understand, in as few 
words as possible, who Mary was, what she was, and 
how she came to be a thorn in the royal pillow of 
Elizabeth. 

She was the daughter of the Queen Regent of 
Scotland, Mary of Guise. She had been married, 
when a mere child, to the Dauphin, the son and heir 
of the King of France. The Pope, who pretended 
that no one could rightfully wear the crown of Eng- 
land without his gracious permission, was strongly 
opposed to Elizabeth ; who had not asked for it. And 
as Mary Queen of Scots would have inherited the

English crown in right of her birth, supposing the 
English Parliament not to have altered the succession, 
the Pope himself, and most of the discontented who 
were followers of his, maintained that Mary was the 
rightful Queen of England, and Elizabeth the wrongful 
Queen. Mary being so closely connected with France, 
and France being jealous of England, there was far 
greater danger in this than there would have been if 
she had had no alliance with that great power. And 
when her young husband, on the death of his father, 
became Francis the Second, King of France, the 
matter grew very serious. For the young couple 
styled themselves King and Queen of England ; and 
the Pope was disposed to help them, by doing all the 
mischief he could. 

Now, the reformed religion, under the guidance of 
a stem and powerful preacher, named John Knox, 
and other such men, had been making fierce progress 
in Scotland. It was still a half savage country, where 
there was a great deal of murdering and rioting 
continually going on ; and the Reformers, instead of 
reforming those evils as they should have done, went 
to work in the ferocious old Scottish spirit: laying 
churches and chapels waste, pulling down pictures 
and altars, and knocking about the Grey Friars, and

the Black Friars, and the White Friars, and the friars 
of all sorts of colours, in all directions. This obdurate 
and harsh spirit of the Scottish Reformers (the Scotch 
have always been rather a sullen and frowning people 
in religious matters) put up the blood of the Romish 
French court, and caused France to send troops over 
to Scotland, with the hope of setting the friars of all 
sorts of colours on their legs again; of conquering 
that country first, and England afterwards; and so 
crushing the Reformation all to pieces. The Scottish 
Reformers, who had formed a great league which they 
called The Congregation of the Lord, secretly repre- 
sented to Elizabeth that, if the reformed religion got 
the worst of it with them, it would be likely to get 
the worst of it in England too ; and thus, Elizabeth, 
although she had a high notion of the rights of Kings 
and Queens to do anything they liked, sent an army 
to Scotland to support the Reformers, who were in 
arms against their sovereign. All these proceedings 
led to a treaty of peace at Edinburgh, under which 
the French consented to depart from the kingdom. 
By a separate treaty, Mary and her young husband 
engaged to renounce their assumed title of King 
and Queen of England. But this treaty they never 
fulfilled.

It happened, soon after matters had got to this 
state, that the young French King died, leaving 
Mary a young widow. She was then invited by her 
Scottish subjects to return home and reign over 
them ; and as she was not now happy where she was, 
she, after a little time, complied. 

Elizabeth had been Queen three years, when Mary 
Queen of Scots embarked at Calais for her own rough, 
quarrelling country. As she came out of the harbour, 
a vessel was lost before her eyes, and she said, “ O ! 
good God ! what an omen this is for such a voyage ! ” 
She was very fond of France, and sat on the deck, 
looking back at it and weeping, until it was quite 
dark. When she went to bed, she directed to be 
called at daybreak, if the French coast were still 
visible, that she might behold it for the last time. 
As it proved to be a clear morning, this was done, and 
she again wept for the country she was leaving, and 
said many times, “ Farewell, France ! Farewell, France! 
I shall never see thee again !” All this was long 
remembered afterwards, as sorrowful and interesting 
in a fair young princess of nineteen ; and I am afraid 
it gradually came, together with her other distresses, 
to surround her with greater sympathy than she de- 
served.

When she came to Scotland, and took up her abode 
at the palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh, she found 
herself among uncouth strangers, and wild uncom- 
fortable customs, very different from her experiences 
in the court of France. The very people who were 
disposed to love her, made her head ache when she 
was tired out by her voyage, with a serenade of dis- 
cordant music — a fearful concert of bagpipes, I suppose 
— and brought her and her train home to her palace 
on miserable little Scotch horses that appeared to be 
half-starved. Among the people who were not dis- 
posed to love her, she found the powerful leaders of 
the Reformed Church, who were hitter upon her 
amusements, however innocent, and denounced music 
and dancing as works of the devil. John Knox himself 
often lectured her, violently and angrily, and did much 
to make her life unhappy. All these reasons confirmed 
her old attachment to the Romish religion, and caused 
her, there is no doubt, most imprudently and danger- 
ously, both for herself and for England too, to give a 
solemn pledge to the heads of the Romish Church 
that if she ever succeeded to the English crown, she 
would set up that religion again. In reading her 
unhappy history, you must always remember this ; and 
also that during her whole life she was constantly put

forward against the Queen, in some form or other, by 
the Romish party. 

That Elizabeth, on the other hand, was not inclined 
to like her, is pretty certain. Elizabeth was very vain 
and jealous, and had an extraordinary dislike to people 
being married. She treated Lady Catherine Grey, 
sister of the beheaded Lady Jane, with such shameful 
severity, for no other reason than her being secretly 
married, that she died and her husband was ruined ; so, 
when a second marriage for Mary began to be talked 
about, probably Elizabeth disliked her more. Not that 
Elizabeth wanted suitors of her own, for they started 
up from all sorts of places : Spain, Austria, Sweden, 
and England. Her English lover at this time, and 
one whom she much favoured too, was Lord Robert 
Dudley, Earl of Leicester — himself secretly married 
to Amy Robsart, the daughter of an English gentle- 
man, whom he was strongly suspected of causing to be 
murdered, down at his country seat, Cumnor Hall in 
Berkshire, that he might be free to marry the Queen. 
Upon this story, the great writer, Sir Walter Scott, 
has founded one of his best romanoes. But if Eliza- 
beth knew how to lead her handsome favourite on for 
her own vanity and pleasure, she knew how to stop him 
for her own pride ; and his love, and all the other pro-

posals, came to nothing. The Queen always declared 
in good set speeches, that she would never be married 
at all, but would live and die a Maiden Queen. It was 
a very pleasant and meritorious declaration I suppose; 
but it has been puffed and trumpeted so much, that I 
am rather tired of it myself. 

Divers princes proposed to marry Mary, but the 
English court had reasons for being jealous of them 
all, and even proposed, as a matter of policy, that she 
should marry that very Earl of Leicester, who had 
aspired to be the husband of Elizabeth. At last, 
Lord Darnley, son of the Earl of Lennox, and him- 
self descended from the Royal Family of Scotland, 
went over with Elizabeth’s consent to try his fortune 
at Holyrood. He was a tall simpleton ; and could 
dance and play the guitar ; but I know of nothing else 
he could do, unless it were to get very drunk, and eat 
gluttonously, and make a contemptible spectacle of 
himself in many mean and vain ways. However, he 
gained Mary’s heart ; not disdaining in the pursuit of 
his object to ally himself with one of her secretaries, 
David Rizzio, who had great influence with her. 
He soon married the queen. This marriage does not 
say much for her, but what followed it will presently 
less. 



106 A child’s HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 

Mary’s brother, the Earl of Murray, and head of 
the Protestant party in Scotland, had opposed this 
marriage, partly on religious grounds, and partly, 
perhaps, from personal dislike of the very contemptible 
bridegroom. When it had taken place, through Mary’s 
gaining over to it the more powerful of the lords about 
her, she banished Murray for his pains ; and, when he 
and some other nobles rose in arms to support the 
Reformed religion, she herself, within a month of her 
wedding day, rode against them in armour, with loaded 
pistols in her saddle. Driven out of Scotland, they 
presented themselves before Elizabeth — who called 
them traitors in public, and assisted them in private, 
according to her crafty nature. 

Mary had been married but a little while, when she 
began to hate her husband ; who, in his turn, began to 
hate that David Rizzio, with whom he had leagued to 
gain her favour, and whom he now believed to be her 
lover. He hated Rizzio to that extent, that he made 
a compact with Lord Ruthven and three other lords 
to get rid of him by murder. This wicked agreement 
they made in solemn secresy upon the first of March, 
fifteen hundred and sixty-six, and on the night of 
Saturday the ninth, the conspirators were brought by 
Damley up a private staircase, dark and steep, into

a range of rooms where they knew that Mary was 
sitting at supper with her sister, Lady Argyle, and 
this doomed man. When they went into the room, 
Darnley took the Queen round the waist, and Lord 
Ruthven, who had risen from a bed of sickness to 
do this murder, came in, gaunt and ghastly, leaning 
on two men ; Rizzio ran behind the Queen for shelter 
and protection. “Let him come out of the room,” 
said Ruthven. “ He shall not leave the room,” replied 
the Queen. “ I read his danger in your face, and it is 
my will that he remain here.” They then set upon 
him, struggled with him, overturned the table, dragged 
him out, and killed him with fifty-six stabs. When 
the Queen heard that he was dead, she said, “ No more 
tears. I will think now of revenge ! ” 

Within a day or two, she gained her husband over, 
and prevailed on the long idiot to abandon the con- 
spirators and fly with her to Dunbar. There he issued 
a proclamation, audaciously and falsely denying that 
he had had any knowledge of the late bloody business ; 
and there they were joined by the Eakl Bothwell 
and some other nobles. With their help, they raised 
eight thousand men, returned to Edinburgh and drove 
the assassins into England. Mary soon afterwards 
gave birth to a son — still thinking of revenge.

That she should have had a greater scorn for her 
husband after his late cowardice and treachery than 
she had had before, was natural enough. There is 
very little doubt that she now began to love Bothwell 
instead, and to plan with hiin means of getting rid of 
Damley. Bothwell had such power over her that he 
induced her even to pardon the assassins of Bizzio. 
The arrangements for the christening of the young 
Prince were intrusted to him, and he was one of the 
most important people at the ceremony, where the 
child was named James : Elizabeth being his god- 
mother, though not present on the occasion. A week 
afterwards Darnley, who had left Mary and gone to 
his father’s house at Glasgow, being taken ill with the 
small-pox, she sent her own physician to attend him. 
But there is great reason to apprehend that this was 
merely a show and a pretence, and that she knew what 
was doing, when Bothwell, within another month, 
proposed to one of the late conspirators against Bizzio, 
to murder Damley, “ for that it was the Queen’s mind 
that he should be taken away.” It is certain that on 
that very day she wrote to her ambassador in France, 
complaining of him, and yet went immediately to 
Glasgow, feigning to be very anxious about him, and 
to love him very much. If she wanted to get him

within her power, she succeeded to her heart’s content; 
for she induced him to go back with her to Edinburgh, 
and to occupy, instead of the palace, a lone house out- 
side the city called the Kirk of Field. Here, he lived 
for about a week. One Sunday night, she remained 
with him until ten o’clock, and then left him, to go to 
Holyrood to be present at an entertainment given in 
celebration of the marriage of one of her favourite 
servants. At two o’clock in the morning the city was 
shaken by a great explosion, and the Kirk of Field 
was blown to atoms. 

Damley’s body was found next day lying under a 
tree at some distance. How it came there, undis- 
figured and unscorched by gunpowder, and how this 
crime came to be so clumsily and strangely committed, 
it is impossible to discover. The deceitful character 
of Mary, and the deceitful character of Elizabeth, have 
rendered almost every part of their joint history un- 
certain and obscure. But, I fear that Mary was 
unquestionably a party to her husband’s murder, and 
that this was the revenge she had threatened. The 
Scotch people universally believed it. Voices cried 
out in the streets of Edinburgh in the dead of the 
night, for justice on the murderess. Placards were 
posted by unknown hands in the public places

denouncing Bothwell as the murderer, and the Queen 
as his accomplice ; and, when he afterwards married 
her (though himself already married), previously making 
a show of taking her prisoner by force, the indignation 
of the people knew no bounds. The women particularly 
are described as having been quite frantic with their 
guilty Queen, and to have hooted and cried after her 
in the streets with terrific vehemence. 

Such guilty unions seldom prosper. This husband 
and wife had lived together but a month, when they 
were separated for ever by the successes of a band of 
Scotch nobles who associated against them for the 
protection of the young Prince: whom Bothwell had 
vainly endeavoured to lay hold of, and whom he would 
certainly have murdered, if the Earl of Mar, in whose 
hands the boy was, had not been firmly and honourably 
faithful to his trust. Before this angry power, Both- 
well fled abroad, where he died, a prisoner and mad, 
nine miserable years afterwards. Mary being found 
by the associated lords to deceive them at every turn, 
was sent a prisoner to Lochleven Castle ; which, as it 
stood in the midst of a lake, could only be approached 
by boat. Here, one Lord Lindsay, who was so much 
of a brute that the nobles would have done better if 
they had chosen a mere gentleman for their messenger,

made her sign her abdication, and appoint Murray, 
Regent of Scotland. Here, too, Murray saw her in a 
sorrowing and humbled state. 

She had better have remained in the castle of 
Lochleven, dull prison as it was, with the rippling of 
the lake against it, and the moving shadows of the 
water on the room-walls ; but she could not rest there, 
and more than once tried to escape. The first time 
she had nearly succeeded, dressed in the clothes of her 
own washerwoman: when, putting up her hand to 
prevent one of the boatmen from lifting her veil, the 
men suspected her, seeing how white it was, and rowed 
her back again. A, short time afterwards, her fascinat- 
ing manners enlisted in her cause a boy in the Castle, 
called the little Douglas, who, while the family were 
at supper, stole the keys of the great gate, went softly 
out with the Queen, locked the gate on the outside, and 
rowed her away across the lake, sinking the keys as 
they went along. On the opposite shore she was met by 
another Douglas, and some few lords ; and, so accom- 
panied, rode away on horseback to Hamilton, where 
they raised three thousand men. Here, she issued a 
proclamation, declaring that the abdication she had 
signed in her prison was illegal, and requiring the 
Regent to yield to his lawful Queen. Being a steady

soldier, and in no way discomposed although he was 
without an army, Murray pretended to treat with her, 
until he had collected a force about half equal to her 
own, and then he gave her battle. In one quarter-of- 
an-hour he cut down all her hopes. She had another 
weary ride on horseback of sixty long Scotch miles, 
and took shelter at Dundrennan Abbey, whence she 
fled for safety to Elizabeth’s dominions. 

Mary Queen of Scots came to England — to her own 
ruin, the trouble of the kingdom, and the misery and 
death of many — in the year one thousand five hundred 
and sixty-eight. How she left it and the world, nine- 
teen years afterwards, we have now to see. 


Second Part. 

When Mary Queen of Scots arrived in England, 
without money and even without any other clothes than 
those she wore, she wrote to Elizabeth, representing 
herself as an innocent and injured piece of Royalty, 
and entreating her assistance to oblige her Scottish 
subjects to take her back again and obey her. But, as 
her character was already known in England to be a 
very different one from what she made it out to be, she

was told in answer that she must first clear herself. 
Made uneasy by this condition, Mary, rather than stay 
in England, would have gone to Spain, or to France, 
or would even have gone back to Scotland. But, as 
her doing either would have been likely to trouble 
England afresh, it was decided that she should be 
detained here. She first came to Carlisle, and, after 
that, was moved about from castle to castle, as was 
considered necessary ; but England she never left again. 

After trying very hard to get rid of the necessity of 
clearing herself, Mary, advised by Lord Herrees, her 
best friend in England, agreed to answer the charges 
against her, if the Scottish noblemen who made them 
would attend to maintain them before such English 
noblemen as Elizabeth might appoint for that purpose. 
Accordingly, such an assembly, under the name of a 
conference, met, first at York, and afterwards at 
Hampton Court. In its presence Lord Lennox, 
Darnley’s father, openly charged Mary with the murder 
of his son ; and whatever Mary’s friends may now say 
or write in her behalf, there is no doubt that, when her 
brother Murray produced against her a casket contain- 
ing certain guilty letters and verses which he stated to 
have passed between her and Bothwell, she withdrew 
from the inquiry. Consequently, it is to be supposed

that she was then considered guilty by those who had 
the best opportunities of judging of the truth, and that 
the feeling which afterwards arose in her behalf was a 
very generous, but not a very reasonable one. 

However, the Duke of Norfolk, an honourable but 
rather weak nobleman, partly because Mary was capti- 
vating, partly because he was ambitious, and partly 
because he was over persuaded by artful plotters against 
Elizabeth, conceived a strong idea that he would like 
to marry the Queen of Scots — though, he was a little 
frightened, too, by the letters in the casket. This idea 
being secretly encouraged by some of the noblemen of 
Elizabeth’s court, and even by the favourite Earl of 
Leicester (because it was objected to by other favourites 
who were his rivals), Mary expressed her approval of 
it, and the King of France and the King of Spain are 
supposed to have done the same. It was not so quietly 
planned, though, but that it came to Elizabeth’s ears, 
who warned the Duke “ to be careful what sort of pillow 
he was going to lay his head upon.” He made a 
humble reply at the time ; but turned sulky soon after- 
wards, and, being considered dangerous, was sent to 
the Tower. 

Thus, from the moment of Mary’s coming to Eng- 
land she began to be the centre of plots and miseries.

A rise of the Catholics in the north was the next of 
these, and it was only checked by many executions and 
much bloodshed. It was followed by a great con- 
spiracy among the Pope and some of the Catholic 
sovereigns of Europe to depose Elizabeth; place Mary 
on the throne, and restore the unreformed religion. It 
is almost impossible to doubt that Mary knew and 
approved of it ; and the Pope himself was so hot in the 
matter that he issued a bull, in which he openly called 
Elizabeth the “ pretended Queen” of England, excom- 
municated her, and excommunicated all her subjects 
who should continue to obey her. A copy of this 
miserable paper got into London, and was found one 
morning publicly posted on the Bishop of London’s 
gate. A great hue and cry being raised, another copy 
was found in the chamber of a student of Lincoln’s Inn, 
who confessed, being put upon the rack, that he had 
received it from one John Felton, a rich gentleman 
who lived across the Thames, near Southwark. This 
John Felton, being put upon the rack too, confessed 
that he had posted the placard on the Bishop’s gate. 
For this offence he was, within four days, taken to St. 
Paul’s Churchyard, and there hanged and quartered. 
As to the Pope’s bull, the people by the Reformation 
having thrown off the Pope, did not care much, you

may suppose, for the Pope's throwing off them. It was 
a mere dirty piece of paper, and not half so powerful as 
a street ballad. 

On the very day when Felton was brought to his trial, 
the poor Duke of Norfolk was released. It would have 
been well for him if he had kept away from the Tower 
evermore, and from the snares that had taken him 
there. But, even while he was in that dismal place he 
corresponded with Mary ; and, as soon as he was out of 
it, he began to plot again. Being discovered in corre- 
spondence with the Pope, with a view to a rising in 
England, which should force Elizabeth to consent to 
his marriage with Mary, and to repeal the laws against 
the Catholics, he was re-committed to the Tower and 
brought to trial. He was found guilty by the unani- 
mous verdict of the Lords who tried him, and was 
sentenced to the block. 

It is very difficult to make out, at this distance of 
time, and between opposite accounts, whether Elizabeth 
really was a humane woman, or desired to appear so, 
or was fearful of shedding the blood of people of great 
name who were popular in the country. Twice she 
commanded and countermanded the execution of this 
Duke, and it did not take place, at last, until five 
months after his trial. The scaffold was erected on

Tower Hill, and there he died like a brave man. He 
refused to have his eyes bandaged, saying that he 
was not at all afraid of death ; and he admitted the 
justice of his sentence, and was much regretted by 
the people. 

Although Mary had shrunk at the most important 
time from disproving her guilt, she was very careful 
never to do anything that would admit it. All such 
proposals as were made to her by Elizabeth for her 
release, required that admission in some form or other, 
and therefore came to nothing. Moreover, both women 
being artful and treacherous, and neither ever trusting 
the other, it was not likely that they could ever make 
an agreement. So, the Parliament, aggravated by 
what the Pope had done, made new and strong laws 
against the spreading of the Catholic religion in Eng- 
land, and declared it treason in any one to say that 
the Queen and her successors were not the lawful 
sovereigns of England. It would have done more than 
this, but for Elizabeth’s moderation. 

Since the Reformation, there had come to be three 
great sects of religious people — or people who called 
themselves so — in England ; that is to say, those who 
belonged to the Reformed Church, those who belonged 
to the Unreformed Church, and those who were called

the Puritans, because they said that they wanted to 
have everything very pure and plain in all the Church 
service. These last were for the most part an uncom- 
fortable people, who thought it highly meritorious to 
dress in a hideous manner, talk through their noses, 
and oppose all harmless enjoyments. But they were 
powerful too, and very much in earnest : and they were, 
one and all, the determined enemies of the Queen of 
Scots. The Protestant feeling in England was further 
strengthened by the tremendous cruelties to which 
Protestants were exposed in France and in the Nether- 
lands. Scores of thousands of them were put to death 
in those countries with every cruelty that can be 
imagined, and at last, in the autumn of the year one 
thousand five hundred and seventy-two, one of the 
greatest barbarities ever committed in the world took 
place at Paris. 

It is called in history, The Massacre of Saint 
Bartholomew, because it took place on Saint Bartho- 
mew’s Eve. It fell on Saturday the twenty-third of 
August. On that day all the great leaders of the 
Protestants (who were there called Huguenots) were 
assembled together, for the purpose, as was represented 
to them, of doing honour to the marriage of their chief, 
the young King of Navarre, with the sister of Charles

the Ninth : a miserable young king who then occupied 
the French throne. This dull creature was made to 
believe by his mother and other fierce Catholics about 
him that the Huguenots meant to take his life ; and he 
was persuaded to give secret orders that, on the tolling 
of a great bell, they should be fallen upon by an over- 
powering force of armed men, and slaughtered wherever 
they could be found. When the appointed hour was 
close at hand, the stupid wretch, trembling from head 
to foot, was taken into a balcony by his mother to see 
the atrocious work begun. The moment the bell tolled, 
the murderers broke forth. During all that night and 
the two next days, they broke into the houses, fired the 
houses, shot and stabbed the Protestants, men, women, 
and children, and flung their bodies into the streets. 
They were shot at in the streets as they passed along, 
and their blood ran down the gutters. Upwards of ten 
thousand Protestants were killed in Paris alone ; and in 
all France four or five times that number. To return 
thanks to Heaven for these diabolical murders, the Pope 
and his train actually went in public procession at 
Eome ; and as if this were not shame enough for them, 
they had a medal struck to commemorate the event. 
But, however comfortable the wholesale murders were 
to those high authorities, they had not that soothing

effect upon the doll- King. I am happy to state that 
he never knew a moment’s peace afterwards ; that he 
was continually crying out that he saw the Huguenots 
covered with blood and wounds falling dead before him ; 
and that he died within a year, shrieking and yelling 
and raving to that degree, that if all the Popes who had 
ever lived had been rolled into one, they would not have 
afforded His guilty Majesty the slightest consolation. 

When the terrible news of the massacre arrived in 
England, it made a powerful impression indeed upon 
the people. If they began to rim a little wild against 
the Catholics at about this time, this fearful reason for 
it, coming so soon after the days of bloody Queen Mary, 
must be remembered in their excuse. The Court was 
not quite so honest as the people — but perhaps it some- 
times is not. It received the French ambassador, with 
all the lords and ladies dressed in deep mourning and 
keeping a profound silence. Nevertheless, a proposal 
of marriage which he had made to Elizabeth only two 
days before the eve of Saint Bartholomew, on behalf of 
the Duke of Alenin, the French King’s brother, a boy 
of seventeen, still went on ; while on the other hand, in 
her usual crafty way, the Queen secretly supplied the 
Huguenots with money and weapons. 

I must say that for a Queen who made all those fine

speeches, of which I have confessed myself to be rather 
tired, about living and dying a Maiden Queen, Elizabeth 
was “ going” to be maried pretty often. Besides always 
having some English favourite or other whom she by 
turns encouraged and swore at and knocked about — 
for the maiden Queen was very free with her fists — she 
held this French Duke off and on through several years. 
When he at last came over to England, the marriage 
articles were actually drawn up, and it was settled that 
the wedding should take place in six weeks. The 
Queen was then so bent upon it, that she prosecuted a 
poor puritan named Stubbs, and a poor bookseller 
named Page, for writing and publishing a pamphlet 
against it. Their right hands were chopped off for 
this crime ; and poor Stubbs — more loyal than I 
should have been myself under the circumstances — 
immediately pulled off his hat with his left hand and 
cried, “God save the Queen!” Stubbs was cruelly 
treated ; for the marriage never took place after all, 
though the Queen pledged herself to the Duke with a 
ring from her own finger. He went away, no better 
than he came, when the courtship had lasted some ten 
years altogether ; and he died a couple of years after- 
wards, mourned by Elizabeth, who appears to have 
been really fond of him. It is not much to her

credit, for he was a bad enough member of a bad 
family. 

To return to the Catholics. There arose two orders 
of priests, who were very busy in England, and who 
were much dreaded. These were the Jesuits (who 
were everywhere in all sorts of disguises), and the 
Seminary Priests. The people had a great horror of 
the first, because they were known to have taught that 
murder was lawful if it were done with an object of 
which they approved; and they had a horror of the 
second because they came to teach the old religion, 
and to be the successors of “ Queen Mary’s priests,” 
as those yet lingering in England were called, when 
they should die out. The severest laws were made 
against them, and were most unmercifully executed. 
Those who sheltered them in their houses often 
suffered heavily for what was an act of humanity ; and 
the rack, that cruel torture which tore men’s limbs 
asunder, was constantly kept going. What these un- 
happy men confessed, or what was ever confessed by 
any one under that agony, must always be received 
with great doubt, as it is certain that people have 
frequently owned to the most absurd and impossible 
crimes, only to escape such dreadful suffering. But I 
cannot doubt it to have been proved by papers, that

there were many plots, both among the Jesuits, and 
with France, and with Scotland, and with Spain, for 
the destruction of Queen Elizabeth, for the placing of 
Mary on the throne, and for the revival of the old 
religion. 

If the English people were too ready to believe in 
plots, there were, as I have said, good reasons for it. 
When the massacre of Saint Bartholomew was yet 
fresh in their recollection, a great Protestant Dutch 
hero, the Prince of Orange, was shot by an assassin, 
who confessed that he had been kept and trained for 
the purpose in a college of Jesuits. The Dutch, in 
this surprise and distress, offered to make Elizabeth 
their sovereign, but she declined the honour, and sent 
them a small army instead, under the command of the 
Earl of Leicester, who, although a capital Court 
favourite, was not much of a general. He did so little 
in Holland, that his campaign there would probably 
have been forgotten, but for its occasioning the death 
of one of the best writers, the best knights, and the 
best gentlemen, of that or any age. This was Sir 
Philip Sidney, who was wounded by a musket ball in 
the thigh as he mounted a fresh horse, after having 
had his own killed under him. He had to ride back 
wounded, a long distance, and was very faint with

fatigue and loss of blood, when some water, for which 
he had eagerly asked, was handed to him. But he 
was so good and gentle even then, that seeing a poor 
badly wounded common soldier lying on the ground, 
looking at the water with longing eyes, he said, “ Thy 
necessity is greater than mine,” and gave it up to him. 
This touching action of a noble heart is perhaps as 
well known as any incident in history — is as famous 
far and wide as the blood-stained Tower of London, 
with its axe, and block, and murders out of number. 
So delightful is an act of true humanity, and so glad 
are mankind to remember it. 

At home, intelligence of plots began to thicken 
every day. I suppose the people never did live under 
such continual terrors as those by which they were 
possessed now, of Catholic risings, and burnings, and 
poisonings, and I don’t know what. Still, we must 
always remember that they lived near and close to 
awful realities of that kind, and that with their 
experience it was not so difficult to believe in any 
enormity. The government had the same fear, and 
did not take the best means of discovering the truth : 
for besides torturing the suspected, it employed paid 
spies, who will always lie for their own profit ; and it 
even made some of the conspiracies it brought to light,

by sending false letters to disaffected people, inviting 
them to join in pretended plots, which they too readily 
did. 

But, one great real plot was at length discovered, 
and it ended the career of Mary, Queen of Scots. A 
seminary priest named Ballard, and a Spanish soldier 
named Savage, set on and encouraged by certain 
French priests, imparted a design to one Antony 
Babington — a gentleman of fortune in Derbyshire, 
who had been for some time a secret agent of Mary’s 
— for murdering the Queen. Babington then confided 
the scheme to some other Catholic gentlemen who were 
his friends, and they joined in it heartily. They were 
vain weak-headed young men, ridiculously confident, 
and preposterously proud of their plan; for they got 
a gimcrack painting made, of the six choice spirits 
who were to murder Elizabeth, with Babington in 
an attitude for the centre figure. Two of their body, 
however, one of whom was a priest, kept Elizabeth’s 
wisest minister, Sir Francis Walsingham, acquainted 
with the whole project from the first. The conspirators 
were completely deceived to the final point, when 
Babington gave Savage, because he was shabby, a ring 
from his finger, and some money from his purse, where- 
with to buy himself new clothes in which to kill the

Queen. Walsingham, having then full evidence against 
the whole band, and two letters of. Mary’s besides, 
resolved to seize them. Suspecting something wrong, 
they stole out of the city, one by one, and hid them- 
selves in St. John’s Wood, and other places which 
really were hiding places then; but they were all 
taken, and all executed. When they were seized, a 
gentleman was sent from Court to inform Mary of the 
fact, and of her being involved in the discovery. Her 
friends have complained that she was kept in very hard 
and severe custody. It does not appear very likely, for 
she was going out a hunting that very morning. 

Queen Elizabeth had been warned long ago, by one 
in France who had good information of what was 
secretly doing, that in holding Mary alive, she held 
“the wolf who would devour her.” The Bishop of 
London had, more lately, given the Queen’s favourite 
minister the advice, in writing, “forthwith to cut off 
the Scottish Queen’s head.” The question now was, 
what to do with her. The Earl of Leicester wrote a 
little note home from Holland, recommending that she 
should be quietly poisoned ; that noble favourite having 
accustomed his mind, it is possible, to remedies of that 
nature. His black advice, however, was disregarded, 
and she was brought to trial at Fotheringay Castle in

Northamptonshire, before a tribunal of forty, composed 
of both religions. There, and in the Star Chamber at 
Westminster, the trial lasted a fortnight. She defended 
herself with great ability, but could only deny the con- 
fessions that had been made by Babington and others ; 
could only call her own letters, produced against her 
by her own secretaries, forgeries ; and, in short, could 
only deny everything. She was found guilty, and 
declared to have incurred the penalty of death. The 
Parliament met, approved the sentence, and prayed the 
Queen to have it executed. The Queen replied that 
she requested them to consider whether no means 
could be found of saving Mary’s life without endanger- 
ing her own. The Parliament rejoined, No ; and the 
citizens illuminated their houses and lighted bonfires, 
in token of their joy that all these plots and troubles 
were to be ended by the death of the Queen of Scots. 

She, feeling sure that her time was now come, 
wrote a letter to the Queen of England, making three 
entreaties ; first, that she might be buried in France ; 
secondly, that she might not be executed in secret, but 
before her servants and some others ; thirdly, that after 
her death, her servants should not be molested, but 
should be suffered to go home with the legacies she 
left them. It was an affecting letter, and Elizabeth

shed tears over it, but sent no answer. Then came a 
special ambassador from France, and another from 
Scotland, to intercede for Mary’s life; and then the 
nation began to clamour, more and more, for her death. 

What the real feelings or intentions of Elizabeth 
were, can never be known now ; but I strongly suspect 
her of only wishing one thing more than Mary’s death, 
and that was to keep free of the blame of it. On the 
first of February, one thousand five hundred and 
eighty-seven, Lord Burleigh having drawn out the 
warrant for the execution, the Queen sent to the 
secretary Davison to bring it to her, that she might 
sign it : which she did. Next day, when Davison told 
her it was sealed, she angrily asked him why such 
haste was necessary? Next day but one she joked 
about it, and swore a little. Again, next day but one, 
she seemed to complain that it was not yet done, but 
still she would not be plain with those about her. So, 
on the seventh, the Earls of Kent and Shrewsbury, 
with the Sheriff of Northamptonshire, came with the 
warrant to Fotheringay, to tell the Queen of Scots to 
prepare for death. 

When those messengers of ill omen were gone, Mary 
made a frugal supper, drank to her servants, read over 
her will, went to bed, slept for some hours, and then

aro^e and passed the remainder of the night saying 
prayers. In the morning she dressed herself in her 
best clothes ; and, at eight o’clock when the sheriff came 
for her to her chapel, took leave of her servants who 
were there assembled praying with her, and went down 
stairs, carrying a Bible in one hand and a crucifix in 
the other. Two of her women and four of her men 
were allowed to be present in the hall ; where a low 
scaffold, only two feet from the ground, was erected 
and covered with black; and where the executioner 
from the Tower, and his assistant, stood, dressed in 
black velvet. The hall was full of people. While the 
sentence was being read she sat upon a stool ; and, when 
it was finished, she again denied her guilt, as she had 
done before. The Earl of Kent and the Dean of 
Peterborough, in their Protestant zeal, made some very 
unnecessary speeches to her ; to which she replied that 
she died in the Catholic religion, and they need not 
trouble themselves about that matter. When her head 
and neck were uncovered by the executioners, she said 
that she had not been used to be undressed by such 
hands, or before so much company. Finally, one of 
her women fastened a cloth over her face, and she laid 
her neck upon the block, and repeated more than once 

in Latin, “Into thy hands, 0 Lord, I commend my

spirit ! 99 Some say her head was struck off in two 
blows, some say in three. However that be, when it 
was held up, streaming with blood, the real hair 
beneath the false hair she had long worn was seen 
to be as grey as that of a woman of seventy, though 
she was at that time only in her forty-sixth year. All 
her beauty was gone. 

But she was beautiful enough to her little dog, who 
cowered under her dress, frightened, when she went 
upon the scaffold, and who lay down beside her head- 
less body when all her earthly sorrows were over. 


Third Part. 

On its being formally made known to Elizabeth that 
the sentence had been executed on the Queen of Scots, 
she showed the utmost grief and rage, drove her 
favorites from her with violent indignation, and sent 
Davison to the Tower ; from which place he was only 
released in the end by paying an immense fine which 
completely ruined him. Elizabeth not only over-acted 
her part in making these pretences, but most basely 
reduced to poverty one of her faithful servants, for no 
other fault than obeying her commands.

James, King of Scotland, Mary’s son, made a show 
likewise of being very angry on the occasion ; but, as 
he was a pensioner of England to the amount of five 
thousand pounds a year, and had known very little of 
his mother, and possibly regarded her as the murderer 
of his father besides, he soon took it quietly. 

Philip, King of Spain, however, threatened to do 
greater things than ever had been done yet, to set up 
the Catholic religion and punish Protestant England. 
Elizabeth, hearing that he and the Prince of Parma 
were making great preparations for this purpose, in 
order to be beforehand with them sent out Admiral 
Drake (a famous navigator, who had sailed about the 
world, and had already brought great plunder from 
Spain) to the port of Cadiz, where he burnt a hundred 
vessels full of stores. This great loss obliged the 
Spaniards to put off the invasion for a year ; but it was 
none the less formidable for that, amounting to one 
hundred and thirty ships, nineteen thousand soldiers, 
eight thousand sailors, two thousand slaves, and between 
two and three thousand great guns. England was not 
idle in making ready to resist this great force. All the 
men between sixteen years old and sixty, were trained 
and drilled ; the national fleet of ships (in number only 
thirty-four at first) was enlarged by public contributions

and by private ships, fitted out by noblemen ; the city 
of London, of its own accord, furnished double the 
number of ships and men that it was required to pro- 
vide ; and, if ever the national spirit was up in England, 
it was up all through the country to resist the Spaniards. 
Some of the Queen’s advisers were for seizing the 
principal English Catholics, and putting them to death ; 
but the Queen — who, to her honour, used to say, that 
she would never believe any ill of her subjects, which 
a parent would not believe of her own children — rejected 
the advice, and only confined a few of those who were 
the most suspected among them, in the fens in Lin- 
colnshire. The great body of Catholics deserved this 
confidence ; for they behaved most loyally, nobly, and 
bravely. 

So, with all England firing up like one strong angry 
man, and with both sides of the Thames fortified, and 
with the soldiers under arms, and the sailors in their 
ships, the country waited for the coming of the proud 
Spanish fleet, which was called The Invincible Armada. 
The Queen herself, riding on a white horse with armour 
on her back, and the Earl of Essex and the Earl of 
Leicester holding her bridle rein, made a brave speech 
to the troops at Tilbury Fort opposite Gravesend, 
^hich was received with such enthusiasm as is seldom

known. Then came the Spanish Armada into the 
English Channel, sailing along in the form of a half 
moon, of such great size, that it was seven miles broad. 
But the English were quickly upon it, and woe then 
to all the Spanish ships that dropped a little out of the 
half moon, for the English took them instantly ! And 
it soon appeared that the great armada was anything 
but invincible, for on a summer night, bold Drake sent 
eight blazing fire-ships right into the midst of it. In 
terrible consternation the Spaniards tried to get out to 
sea, and so became dispersed; the English pursued 
them at a great advantage ; a storm came on, and drove 
the Spaniards among rocks and shoals ; and the 
swift end of the Invincible fleet was, that it lost thirty 
great ships and ten thousand men, and, defeated and 
disgraced, sailed home again. Being afraid to go by 
the English Channel, it sailed all round Scotland and 
Ireland ; and, some of the ships getting cast away on 
the latter coast in bad weather, the Irish, who were a 
kind of savages, plundered those vessels and killed their 
crews. So ended this great attempt to invade and 
conquer England ; and I think it will be a long time 
before any other invincible fleet coming to England 
with the same object, will fare much better than the 
Spanish Armada.

Though the Spanish king had had this bitter taste of 
English bravery, he was So little the wiser for it, as still 
to entertain his old designs, and even to conceive the 
absurd idea of placing his daughter on the English 
throne. But the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter R ale igh, 
Sir Thomas Howard, and some other distinguished 
leaders, putting to sea from Plymouth, entered the port 
of Cadiz once more, obtained a complete victory over 
the shipping assembled there, and got possession of the 
town. In obedience to the Queen's express instructions, 
they behaved with great humanity ; and the principal 
loss of the Spaniards was a vast sum of money which 
they had to pay for ransom. This was one of many 
gallant achievements on the sea, effected in this reign. 
Sir Walter Baleigh himself, after marrying a maid of 
honour and giving offence to the Maiden Queen thereby, 
had already sailed to South America in search of gold, 
and written an excellent account of his voyage. 

The Earl of Leicester was now dead, and so was 
Sir Thomas Walsingham, whom Lord Burleigh was 
soon to follow. The principal favorite was the Earl 
of Essex, a spirited and handsome man, a favorite 
with the people too as well as with the Queen, and 
possessed of many admirable qualities. It was much 
debated at Court whether there should be peace with

Spain or no, and he was very urgent for war. He also 
tried hard to have his own way in the appointment of 
a deputy to govern in Ireland. One day, while this 
question was in dispute, he hastily took offence, and 
turned his back upon the Queen ; as a gentle reminder 
of which impropriety, the Queen gave him a tremendous 
box on the ear, and told him to go to the devil. He 
went home instead, and did not reappear at Court for 
half a year or so, when he and the Queen were recon- 
ciled, though never (as some suppose) thoroughly. 

From this time the fate of the Earl of Essex and 
that of the Queen seemed to be blended together. The 
Irish were still perpetually quarrelling and fighting 
among themselves, and he went over to Ireland as 
Lord Lieutenant, to the great joy of his enemies (Sir 
Walter Raleigh among the rest) who were glad to have 
so dangerous a rival far off. Not being by any means 
successful there, and knowing that his enemies would 
take advantage of that circumstance to injure him with 
the Queen, he came home again, though against her 
orders. The Queen being taken by surprise when he 
appeared before her, gave him her hand to kiss, and he 
was overjoyed — though it was not a very lovely one by 
this time; but in the course of the same day she 
ordered him to confine himself to his room, and two or

three days afterwards had him taken into custody. 
With the same sort of caprice — and as capricious an 
old woman she now was as ever wore a crown or a head 
either — she sent him broth from her own table on his 
falling ill from anxiety, and cried about him. 

He was a man who could find comfort and occupa- 
tion in his books, and he did so for a time ; not the 
least happy time, I dare say, of his life. But it happened 
unfortunately for him, that he held a monopoly in sweet 
wines : which means that nobody could sell them with- 
out purchasing his permission. This right, which was 
only for a term, expiring, he applied to have it renewed. 
The Queen refused, with the rather strong observation 
— but she did make strong observations — that an unruly 
beast must be stinted in his food. Upon this, the 
angry Earl, who had been already deprived of many 
offices, thought himself in danger of complete ruin, and 
turned against the Queen, whom he called a vain old 
woman, who had grown as crooked in her mind as she 
had in her figure. These uncomplimentary expressions 
the ladies of the Court immediately snapped up and 
carried to the Queen, whom they did not put in a better 
temper, you may believe. The same Court ladies, when 
they had beautiful dark hair of their own, used to 
wear false red hair, to be like the Queen. So they

were not very high-spirited ladies, however high 
in rank. 

The worst object of the Earl of Essex, and some 
friends of his who used to meet at Lord Southampton’s 
house, was to obtain possession of the Queen, and 
oblige her by force to dismiss her ministers and change 
her favorites. On Saturday the seventh of February, 
one thousand six hundred and one, the council suspect- 
ing this, summoned the Earl to come before them. He, 
pretending to be ill, declined ; and it was then settled 
among his friends, that as the next day would be Sunday, 
when many of the citizens usually assembled at the 
Cross by St. Paul’s Cathedral, he should make one bold 
effort to induce them to rise and follow him to the Palace. 

So, on the Sunday morning, he and a small body of 
adherents started out of his house — Essex House by 
the Strand, with steps to the river — having first shut up 
in it, as prisoners, some members of the council who 
came to examine him, and hurried into the City with the 
Earl at their head, crying out “ For the Queen! For the 
Queen ! A plot is laid for my life I” No one heeded 
them, however, and when they came to St. Paul’s there 
were no citizens there. In the meantime the prisoners 
at Essex House had been released by one of the Earl’s 
own friends ; he had been promptly proclaimed a traitor

in the City itself ; and the streets were barricaded with 
carts and guarded by soldiers. The Earl got back to 
his house by water, with great difficulty, and, after an 
attempt to defend it against the troops and cannon by 
which it was soon surrounded, gave himself up that 
night. He was brought to trial on the nineteenth, and 
found guilty ; on the twenty-fifth, he was executed on 
Tower Hill, where he died, at thirty-four years old, 
both courageously and penitently. His step-father 
suffered with him. His enemy, Sir Walter Raleigh, 
stood near the scaffold all the time — but not so near to 
it as we shall see him stand, before we finish his history. 

In this case, as in those of the Duke of Norfolk and 
Mary Queen of Scots, the Queen had commanded, and 
countermanded, and again commanded, the execution. 
It is probable that the death of her young and gallant 
favorite in the prime of his good qualities, was 
never off her mind afterwards, but she held out, 
the same vain, obstinate, and capricious woman, for 
another year. Then she danced before her Court on 
a state occasion — and cut, I should think, a mighty 
ridiculous figure ; doing so in an immense ruff, stomacher 
and wig, at seventy years old. For another year still 
she held out, but, without any more dancing, and as a 
moody, sorrowful, broken creature. At last, on the

tenth of March, one thousand six hundred and three, 
having been ill of a very bad cold, and made worse by 
the death of the Countess of Nottingham, who was her 
intimate friend, she fell into a stupor and was supposed 
to be dead. She recovered her consciousness, however, 
and then nothing would induce her to go to bed ; for 
she said that she knew that if she did she would never 
get up again. There she lay for ten days, on cushions 
on the floor, without any food, until the Lord Admiral 
got her into bed at last, partly by persuasions and 
partly by main force. When they asked her who should 
succeed her, she replied that her seat had been the seat 
of Kings, and that she would have for her successor 
“ No rascal’s son, but a King’s.” Upon this, the lords 
present stared at one another, and took the liberty of 
asking whom she meant ; to which she replied, “ Whom 
should I mean, but our cousin of Scotland !” This 
was on the twenty-third of March. They asked her 
once again that day, after she was speechless, whether 
she was still in the same mind ? She struggled up in 
bed, and joined her hands over her head in the form of 
a crown, as the only reply she could make. At three 
o’clock next morning, she very quietly died, in {he 
forty-fifth year of her reign. 

That reign had been a glorious one, and is made for

ever memorable by the distinguished men who flourished 
in it. Apart from the great voyagers, statesmen, and 
scholars, whom it produced, the names of Bacon, 
Spenser, and Shakspeare, will always be remembered 
with pride and veneration by the civilised world, and 
will always impart (though with no great reason, per- 
haps) some portion of their lustre to the name of 
Elizabeth. It was a great reign for discovery, for 
commerce, and for English enterprise and spirit in 
general. It was a great reign for the Protestant reli- 
gion and for the Reformation which made England 
free. The Queen was very popular, and in her pro- 
gresses, or journeys about her dominions, was every- 
where received with the liveliest joy. I think the truth 
is, that she was not half so good as she has been made 
out, and not half so bad as she has been made out. She 
had her fine qualities, but she was coarse, capricious, 
and treacherous, and had all the faults of an excessively 
vain young woman long after she was an old one. On 
the whole, she had a great deal too much of her father 
in her to please me. 

Many improvements and luxuries were introduced in 
the course of these five and forty years in the general 
manner of living ; but cock-fighting, bull-baiting, and 
bear-baiting, were still the national amusements ; and

Queen herself, on many high occasions, rode on horse- 
back on a pillion behind the Lord Chancellor.

“ Our cousin of Scotland ” was ugly, awkward, and 
shuffling both in mind and person. His tongue was 
much too large for his mouth, his legs were much too 
weak for his body, and his dull goggle-eyes stared 
and rolled like an idiot’s. He was cunning, covetous, 
wasteful, idle, drunken, greedy, dirty, cowardly, a 
great swearer, and the most conceited man on earth. 
His figure — what is commonly called ricketty from 
his birth — presented the most ridiculous appearance 
that can be imagined, dressed in thick padded clothes, 
as a safeguard against being stabbed (of which he 
lived in continual fear), of a grass-green colour from 
head to foot, with a hunting-horn dangling at the 
side instead of a sword, and his hat and feather 
sticking over one eye, or hanging on the back of his 
head, as he happened to toss it on. He used to loll

on the necks of his favorite courtiers, and slobber 
their faces, and kiss and pinch theif cheeks ; and the 
greatest favorite he ever had, used to sign himself 
in his letters to his royal master, His Majesty’s “ dog 
and slave,” and used to address his majesty as “ his 
Sowship.” His majesty was the worst rider ever 
seen, and thought himself the best. He was one of 
the most impertinent talkers (in the broadest Scotch) 
ever heard, and boasted of being unanswerable in all 
manner of argument. He wrote some of the most 
wearisome treatises ever read, among others, a book upon 
witchcraft, in which he was a devout believer, and thought 
himself a prodigy of authorship. He thought, and wrote, 
and said, that a king had a right to make and unmake 
what laws he pleased, and ought to be accountable 
to nobody on earth. This is the plain, true character 
of the personage whom the greatest men about the 
court praised and flattered to that degree, that I doubt 
if there be anything more shameful in the annals of 
human nature. 

He came to the English throne with great ease* 
The miseries of a disputed succession had been felt 
so long, and so dreadfully, that he was proclaimed 
within a few hours of Elizabeth’s death, and was 
accepted by the nation even without being asked to

give any pledge that he would govern well, or that he 
would redress crying grievances. He took a month 
to come from Edinburgh to London ; and, by way, 
I suppose, of exercising his new power, hanged a 
pickpocket on the journey without any trial, and 
knighted everybody he could lay hold of. He made 
two hundred knights before he got to his palace in 
London, and seven hundred before he had been in it 
three months. He also shovelled sixty-two new peers 
into the House of Lords — and there was a pretty large 
sprinkling of Scotchmen among them, you may believe; 

His Sowship’s prime Minister, Cecil (for I cannot 
do better than call his majesty what his favorite 
called him), was the enemy of Sir Walter Baleigh, 
and also of Sir Walter's political friend, Lord 
Cobham ; and his Sowship's first trouble was a plot 
originated by these two, and entered into by some 
others, with the old object of seizing the King, and 
keeping him in imprisonment until he should change 
his ministers. There were Catholic priests in the 
plot, and there were Puritan noblemen too; for, 
although the Catholics and Puritans were strongly 
opposed to each other, they united at this time against 
his Sowship, because they knew that he had a design 
against both, after pretending to be friendly to each ;

this design being to have only one high and convenient 
form of the Protestant religion, which every body 
should be bound to belong to, whether they liked it 
or not. This plot was mixed up with another, which 
may or may not have had some reference to placing on 
the throne, at some time, the Lady Arabella Stuart ; 
whose misfortune it was to be the daughter of the 
younger brother of his Sowship’s father, but who was 
quite innocent of any part in the scheme. Sir Walter 
Raleigh was accused on the confession of Lord 
Cobham — a miserable creature, who said one thing 
at one time, and another thing at another time, and 
could be relied upon in nothing. The trial of Sir 
Walter Raleigh lasted from eight in the morning 
until nearly midnight; and he defended himself with 
such eloquence, genius, and spirit against all accusa- 
tions, and against the insults of Coke, the Attorney- 
general — who, according to the custom of the time, 
foully abused him — that those who went there detesting 
the prisoner, came away admiring him, and declaring 
that anything so wonderful and so captivating was 
never heard. He was found guilty, nevertheless, 
and sentenced to death. Execution was deferred, 
however, and he was taken to the Tower. The two 
Catholic priests, less fortunate, were executed with

the usual atrocity ; and Lord Cobham and two others 
were pardoned on the scaffold. His Sowship thought 
it wonderfully knowing in him to surprise the people 
by pardoning these three at the very block; but, 
blundering, and bungling, as usual, he had very 
nearly over-reached himself. For the messenger on 
horseback, who brought the pardon, came so late, 
that he was pushed to the outside of the crowd, and 
was obliged to shout and roar out what he came for. 
The miserable Cobham did not gain much by being 
spared that day. He lived, both as a prisoner and 
a beggar, utterly despised, and miserably poor, for 
thirteen years, and then died in an old out-house 
belonging to one of his former servants. 

This plot got rid of, and Sir Walter Raleigh safely 
shut up in the Tower, his Sowship held a great dis- 
pute with the Puritans on their presenting a petition 
to him, and had it all his own way — not so very 
wonderful, as he would talk continually, and would 
not hear anybody else — and filled the Bishops with 
admiration. It was comfortably settled that there was 
to be only one form of religion, and that all men were 
to think exactly alike. But, although this was 
arranged two centuries and a half ago, and although 
the arrangement was supported by much fining and

imprisonment, I do not find that it is quite successful, 
even yet. 

His Sowship, having that uncommonly high opinion 
of himself as a king, had a very low opinion of Par- 
liament, as a power that audaciously wanted to 
control him. When he called his first Parliament 
after he had been king a year, he accordingly thought 
he would take pretty high ground with them, and told 
them that he commanded them “ as an absolute king.” 
The Parliament thought these strong words, and saw 
the necessity of upholding their authority. His Sow- 
ship had three children : Prince Henry, Prince Charles, 
and the Princess Elizabeth. It would have been well 
for one of these, and we shall too soon see which, if 
he had learnt a little wisdom concerning Parliaments 
from his father’s obstinacy. 

Now, the people still labouring under their old 
dread of the Catholic religion, this Parliament revived 
and strengthened the severe laws against it. And 
this so angered Robert Catesby, a restless Catholic 
gentleman of an old family, that he formed one of the 
most desperate and terrible designs ever conceived in 
the mind of man; no less a scheme than the Gun« 
powder Plot. 

His object was, when the King, lords, and commons,

Should be assembled at the next opening of Parliament, 
to blow them up, one and all, with a great mine of gun- 
powder. The first person to whom he confided this 
horrible idea was Thomas Winter, a Worcestershire 
gentleman who had served in the army abroad, and 
had been secretly employed in Catholic projects. 
While Winter was yet undecided, and when he had 
gone over to the Netherlands, to learn from the Spanish 
Ambassador there whether there was any hope of 
Catholics being relieved through the intercession of 
the King of Spain with his Sowship, he found at 
Ostend a tall, dark, daring man, whom he had known 
when they were both soldiers abroad, and whose name 
was Guido — or Guy — Fawkes. Resolved to join the 
plot, he proposed it to this man, knowing him to be 
the man for any desperate deed, and they came back 
to England together. Here, they admitted two other 
conspirators: Thomas Percy, related to the Earl of 
Northumberland, and John Wright, his brother-in- 
law. All these met together in a solitary house in 
the open fields, which were then near Clement’s Inn, 
now a closely blocked-up part of London ; and when 
they had all taken a great oath of secresy, Catesby 
told the rest what his plan was. They then went 

up stairs into a garret, and received the Sacrament

from Father Gerard, a Jesuit, who is said not to 
have known actually of the Gunpowder Plot, but who, 
I think, must have had his suspicions that there was 
something desperate afoot. 

Percy was a Gentleman Pensioner, and as he had 
occasional duties to perform about the Court, then 
kept at Whitehall, there would be nothing suspicious 
in his living at Westminster. So, having looked well 
about him, and having found a house to let, the back 
of which joined the Parliament House, he hired it of 

person named Ferris, for the purpose of under- 
mining the wall. Having got possession of this house, 
the conspirators hired another on the Lambeth side 
of the Thames, which they used as a storehouse for 
wood, gunpowder, and other combustible matters. 
These were to be removed at night (and afterwards 
were removed), hit by bit, to the house at Westminster ; 
and, that there might be some trusty person to keep 
watch over the Lambeth stores, they admitted another 
conspirator, by name Robert Kay, a very poor 
Catholic gentleman. 

All these arrangements had been made some months, 
and it was a dark wintry December night, when the 
conspirators, who had been in the meantime dispersed 
to avoid observation, met in the house at Westminster,

and began to dig. They had laid in a good stock of 
eatables, to avoid going in and out, and they dug and 
dug with great ardour. But, the wall being tremen* 
dously thick, and the work very severe, they took in 
Christopher Wright, a younger brother of John 
Wright, that they might have a new pair of hands to 
help. And Christopher Wright fell to, like a fresh 
man ; and they dug and dug by night and by day, and 
Fawkes stood sentinel all the time. And if any man’s 
heart seemed to fail him at all, Fawkes said, “ Gentle- 
men, we have abundance of powder and shot here, 
and there is no fear of our being taken alive, even if 
discovered.” The same Fawkes, who, in his capacity 
of sentinel, was always prowling about, soon picked 
up the intelligence that the King had prorogued the 
Parliament again, from the seventh of February, the 
day first fixed upon, until the third of October. When 
the conspirators knew this, they agreed to separate 
until after the Christmas holidays, and to take no 
notice of each other in the meanwhile, and never to write 
letters to one another, on any account. So, the house 
in Westminster was shut up again, and I suppose the 
neighbours thought that those strange looking men who 
lived there so gloomily, and went out so seldom, were 
gone away to have a merry Christmas somewhere.

It was the beginning of February, sixteen hundred 
and five, when Catesby met his fellow conspirators 
again at this Westminster house. He had now admitted 
three more : John Grant, a Warwickshire gentleman 
of a melancholy temper, who lived in a doleful house 
near Stratford-upon-Avon, with a frowning wall all 
round it, and a deep moat; Robert Winter, eldest 
brother of Thomas ; and Catesby’s own servant, 
Thomas Bates, who, Catesby thought, had had some 
suspicion of what his master was about. These three 
had all suffered more or less, for their religion, in 
Elizabeth’s time. And now they all began to dig 
again, and they dug and dug by night and by day. 

They found it dismal work alone there, underground, 
with such a fearful secret on their minds, and so many 
murders before them. They were filled with wild 
fancies. Sometimes, they thought they heard a great 
bell tolling, deep down in the earth under the 
Parliament House; sometimes, they thought they 
heard low voices muttering about the Gunpowder Plot ; 
and once in the morning, they really did hear a great 
rumbling noise over their heads, as they dug and 
sweated in their mine. Every man stopped and looked 
aghast at his neighbour, wondering what had happened, 
when that bold prowler, Fawkes, who had been out ta

look, came in and told them that it was only a dealer 
in coals who had occupied a cellar under the Parliament 
House, removing his stock in trade to some other place. 
Upon this, the conspirators, who with all their digging 
and digging had not yet dug through the tremendously 
thick wall, changed their plan ; hired that cellar, which 
was directly under the House of Lords; put six- 
and-thirty barrels of gunpowder in it, and covered 
them over with faggots and coals. Then they all dis- 
persed again until September, when the following new 
conspirators were admitted: Sir Edward Baynham, 
of Gloucestershire ; Sir Edward Digby, of Rutland- 
shire; Ambrose Rookwood, of Suffolk; and Francis 
Tresham, of Northamptonshire. Most of these were 
rich, and were to assist the plot, some with money and 
some with horses, on which the conspirators were to 
ride through the country and rouse the Catholics, after 
the Parliament should be blown into the air. 

Parliament being again prorogued from the third of 
October to the fifth of November, and the conspirators 
being uneasy lest their design should have been found 
out, Thomas Winter said he would go up into the 
House of Lords on the day of the prorogation, and see 
how matters looked. Nothing could be better. The 
unconscious Commissioners were walking about, and

talking to one another, just over the six-and-thirty 
barrels of gunpowder. He came back, and told the 
rest so, and they went on with their preparations. 
They hired a ship, and kept it ready in the Thames, 
in which Fawkes was to sail for Flanders after firing 
with a slow match the train that was to explode the 
powder. A number of Catholic gentlemen not in the 
secret, were invited, on pretence of a hunting party, to 
meet Sir Edward Digby at Dunchurch on the fatal day, 
that they might be ready to act together. And now all 
was ready. 

But, now, the great weakness and danger which had 
been all along at the bottom of this wicked plot, began 
to show itself. As the fifth of November drew near, 
most of the conspirators, remembering that they had 
friends and relations who would be in the House of 
Lords that day, felt some natural relenting, and a wish 
to warn them to keep away. They were not much 
comforted by Catesby’s declaring that in such a cause 
he would blow up his own son. Lord Mounteagle, 
Tresham’s brother-in-law, was certain to be in the 
house ; and when Tresham found that he could not 
prevail upon the rest to devise any means of sparing 
their friends, he wrote a mysterious letter to this lord 
and left it at his lodging in the dusk, urging him to

keep away from the opening of Parliament, “since 
God and man had concurred to punish the wickedness 
of the times/’ It contained the words “that the 
Parliament should# receive a terrible blow, and yet 
should not see who hurt them,” and it added, “the 
danger is past, as soon as you have burnt the letter.” 

The ministers and courtiers made out that his Sow* 
ship, by a direct miracle from Heaven, found out what 
this letter meant. The truth is, that they were not long 
(as few men would be) in finding it out for themselves ; 
and it was decided to let the conspirators alone, 
until the very day before the opening of Parliament. 
That the conspirators had their fears, is certain ; for, 
Tresham himself said before them all, that they were 
every one dead men ; and, although even he did not 
take flight, there is reason to suppose that he had 
warned other persons besides Lord Mounteagle. How- 
ever, they were all firm ; and Fawkes, who was a man 
of iron, went down every day and night to keep watch 
in the cellar as usual. He was there about two in the 
afternoon of the fourth, when the Lord Chamberlain 
and Lord Mounteagle threw open the door and looked 
in. “Who are you, friend ? ” said they. “ Why,” said 
Fawkes, “I am Mr. Percy’s servant, and am looking 
after his store of fuel here.” “ Your master has laid in

a pretty good store,” they returned, and shut the door, 
and went away. Fawkes, upon this, posted off to the 
other conspirators to tell them all was quiet, and went 
back and shut himself up in the daik black cellar again, 
where he heard the bell go twelve o’clock and usher in 
the fifth of November. About two hours afterwards, 
he slowly opened the door, and came out to look about 
him, in his old prowling way. He was instantly seized 
and bound, by a party of soldiers under Sir Thomas 
Knevett. He had a watch upon him, some touch- 
wood, some tinder, some slow matches ; and there was 
a dark lantern with a candle in it, lighted, behind the 
door. He had his boots and spurs on — to ride to the 
ship, I suppose — and it was well for the soldiers that 
they took him so suddenly ; for if they had left him 
but a moment’s time to light a match, he certainly 
would have tossed it in among the powder, and blown 
himself and them to perdition. 

They took him to the King’s bed-chamber first of 
all ; and there the King (causing him to be held very 
tight, and keeping a good way off) asked him how he 
could have had the heart to intend to destroy so many 
innocent people ? “ Because,” said Guy Fawkes, 

“ desperate diseases need desperate remedies.” To a 
little Scotch favorite, with a face like a terrier, who

asked him (with no particular wisdom) why he had 
collected so much gunpowder, he replied, because he had 
meant to blow Scotchmen back to Scotland, and it would 
take a good deal of powder to do that. Next day he 
was carried to the Tower, but would make no confession. 
Even after being horribly tortured, he confessed nothing 
that the Government did not already know ; though he 
must have been in a fearful state — as his signature, 
still preserved, in contrast with his natural hand-writing 
before he was put upon the dreadful rack, most fright- 
fully shows. Bates, a very different man, soon said 
the Jesuits had had to do with the plot, and probably, 
under the torture, would as readily have said anything. 
Tresham, taken and put in the Tower too, made con- 
fessions and unmade them, and died of an illness that 
was heavy upon him. Rookwood, who had stationed 
relays of his own horses all the way to Dunchurch, did 
not mount to escape until the middle of the day, when 
the news of the plot was all over London. On the 
road, he came up with the two Wrights, Catesby, and 
Percy; and they all galloped together into North- 
amptonshire. Thence to Dunchurch, where they 
found the proposed party assembled. Finding, how- 
ever, that there had been a plot, and that it had been 
discovered, the party disappeared in the course of the

night, and left them alone with Sir Everard Digby. 
Away they all rode again, through Warwickshire and 
Worcestershire, to a house called Holbeach, on the 
borders of Staffordshire. They tried to raise the 
Catholics on their way, but were indignantly driven off 
by them. All this time they were hotly pursued by 
the sheriff of Worcester, and a fast increasing concourse 
of riders. At last, resolving to defend themselves at 
Holbeach, they shut themselves up in the house, and 
put some wet powder before the fire to dry. But it 
blew up, and Catesby was singed and blackened, and 
almost killed, and some of the others were sadly hurt. 
Still, knowing that they must die, they resolved to die 
there, and with only their swords in their hands 
appeared at the windows to be shot at by the sheriff 
and his assistants. Catesby said to Thomas Winter, 
after Thomas had been hit in the right arm which 
dropped powerless by his side, “ Stand by me, Tom, 
and we will die together! ” — which they did, being shot 
through the body by two bullets from one gun. John 
Wright, and Christopher Wright, and Percy, were also 
shot. Rookwood and Digby were taken : the former 
with a broken arm and a wound in his body too. 

It was the fifteenth of January, before the trial of 
Guy Fawkes, and such of the other conspirators as were

left alive, came on. They were all found guilty, all 
hanged, drawn, and quartered: some in St. Paul’s 
Churchyard, on the top of Ludgate Hill; and some 
before the Parliament House. A Jesuit priest, named 
Henry Garnet, to whom the bloody design was said 
to have been communicated, was taken and tried ; and 
two of his servants, as well as a poor priest who was 
taken with him, were tortured without mercy. He 
himself was not tortured, but was surrounded in the 
Tower by tamperers and traitors, and so made unfairly 
to convict himself out of his own mouth. He said, 
upon his trial, that he had done all he could to prevent 
the deed, and that he could not make public what had 
been told him in confession — though I am afraid he 
knew of the plot in other ways. He was found guilty 
and executed, after a manful defence, and the Catholic 
Church made a saint of him ; some rich and powerful 
persons, who had had nothing to do with the project, 
were fined and imprisoned for it by the Star Chamber. 
The Catholics, in general, who had recoiled with horror 
from the idea of the infernal contrivance, were unjustly 
put under more severe laws than before ; and this was 
the end of the Gunpowder Plot.

Second Part. 

His Sowship would pretty willingly, I think, have 
blown the House of Commons into the air himself ; for 
his dread and jealousy of it knew no bounds all 
through his reign. When he was hard pressed for 
money he was obliged to order it to meet, as he could 
get no money without it; and when it asked him first 
to abolish some of the monopolies in necessaries of life 
which were a great grievance to the people, and to 
redress other public wrongs, he flew into a rage and got 
rid of it again. At one time he wanted it to consent to 
the Union of England with Scotland, and quarrelled 
about that. At another time it wanted him to put down 
a most infamous Church abuse, called the High Com- 
mission Court, and he quarrelled with it about that. 
At another time it entreated him not to be quite so fond 
of his archbishops and bishops who made speeches in 
his praise too awful to be related, but to have some 
little consideration for the poor Puritan clergy who 
were persecuted for preaching in their own way, and 
not according to the archbishops and bishops; and 
they quarrelled about that. In short, what with hating

the House of Commons, and pretending not to hate it ; 
and what with now sending some of its members who 
opposed him, to Newgate, or to the Tower, and now 
telling the rest that they must not presume to make 
speeches about the public affairs, which could not 
possibly concern them; and what with cajoling, and 
bullying, and frightening, and being frightened ; the 
House of Commons was the plague of his Sowship’s 
existence. It was pretty firm, however, in maintaining 
its rights, and in insisting that the Parliament should 
make the laws, and not the King by his own single pro- 
clamations (which he tried hard to do) ; and his Sow- 
ship was often so distressed for money, in consequence, 
that he sold every sort of title and public office as if 
they were merchandise, and even invented a new dignity 
called a Baronetcy, which anybody could buy for a 
thousand pounds. 

These disputes with his Parliaments, and his 
hunting, and his drinking, and his lying in bed — for 
he was a great sluggard — occupied his Sowship pretty 
ivell. The rest of his time he chiefly passed in hugging 
and slobbering his favourites. The first of these was 
Sib Philip Herbert, who had no knowledge whatever, 
except of dogs, and horses, and hunting, but whom he 
soon made Earl of Montgomery. The next, and a

much more famous one, was Robert Carr, or Ker, 
(for it is not certain which was his right name), who 
came from the Border country, and whom he soon 
made Viscount Rochester, and afterwards, Earl of 
Somerset. The way in which his Sowship doated on 
this handsome young man, is even more odious to think 
of, than the way in which the really great men of Eng- 
land condescended to bow down before him. His great 
friend was a certain Sir Thomas Overbury, who wrote 
his love-letters for him and assisted him in the duties 
of his many high places, which his own ignorance pre- 
vented him from discharging. But this same Sir 
Thomas having just manhood enough to dissuade the 
favorite from a wicked marriage with the beautiful 
Countess of Essex, who was to get a divorce from her 
husband for the purpose, the said Countess, in her 
rage, got Sir Thomas put into the Tower, and there 
poisoned him. Then the favorite and this bad 
woman were publicly married by the King’s pet bishop, 
with as much to-do and rejoicing, as if he had been the 
best man, and she the best woman, upon the face of 
the earth. 

But, after a longer sunshine than might have been 
expected — of seven years or so, that is to say — another 
handsome young man started up and eclipsed the Earl

OF Somerset. This was GeorOe Villiers, the 
youngest son of a Leicestershire gentleman : who came 
to Court with all the Paris fashions on him, and could 
dance as well as the best mountebank that ever was 
seen. He soon danced himself into the good graces of 
his Sowship, and danced the other favourite out of 
favour. Then, it was all at once discovered that the 
Earl and Countess of Somerset had not deserved all 
those great promotions and mighty rejoicings, and they 
were separately tried for the murder of Sir Thomas 
Overbury, and for other crimes. But, the King was so 
horribly afraid of his late favorite’s publicly telling 
some disgraceful things he knew of him — which he 
darkly threatened to do — that he was even examined 
with two men standing, one on either side of him, each 
with a cloak in his hand, ready to throw it over his 
head and stop his mouth if he should break out with 
what he had it in his power to tell. So, a very lame 
affair was purposely made of the trial, and his punish* 
ment was an allowance of four thousand pounds a year 
in retirement ; while the countess was pardoned, and 
allowed to pass into retirement too. They hated one 
another by this time, and lived to revile and torment 
each other some years.

Sowship was making such an exhibition of himself, 
from day to day and from year to year, as is not often 
seen in any sty, three remarkable deaths took place in 
England. The first was that of the Minister, Robert 
Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, who was past sixty, and had 
never been strong, being deformed from his birth. He 
said at last that he had no wish to live : and no Minister 
need have had, I am sure, with his experience of the 
meanness and wickedness of those disgraceful times. 
The second was that of the Lady Arabella Stuart, who 
alarmed his Sowship mightily, by privately marrying 
William Seymour, son of Lord Beauchamp, who was 
a descendant of King Henry the Seventh, and who, his 
Sowship thought, might consequently increase and 
strengthen any claim she might one day set up to the 
throne. She was separated from her husband (who 
was put in the Tower) and thrust into a boat to be 
eonfined at Durham. She escaped in a man’s dress to 
get away in a French ship from Gravesend to France, 
but unhappily missed her husband, who had escaped 
too, and was soon taken. She went raving mad in the 
miserable Tower, and died there after four years. The 
last, and the most important of these three deaths, was 
that of Prince Henry, the heir to the throne, in the 
nineteenth year of his age. He was a promising young

prince, and greatly liked; a quiet, well-conducted 
youth, of whom two very good things are known : first 
that his father was jealous of him ; secondly, that he 
was the friend of Sir Walter Raleigh, languishing 
through all those years in the Tower, and often said 
that no man but his father would keep such a bird in 
such a cage. On the occasion of the preparations for 
the marriage of his sister the Princess Elizabeth with 
a foreign prince (and an unhappy marriage it turned 
out) he came from Richmond, where he had been very 
ill, to greet his new brother-in-law, at the palace at 
Whitehall. There he played a great game at tennis, 
in his shirt, though it was very cold weather, and was 
seized with an alarming illness and died within a fort- 
night of a putrid fever. For this young prince Sir 
Walter Raleigh wrote, in his prison in the Tower, the 
beginning of a History of the World: a wonderful 
instance how little his Sotfship could do to confine a 
great man’s mind, however long he might imprison 
his body. 

And this mention of Sir Walter Raleigh, who had 
many faults, but who never showed so many 'merits as 
in trouble and adversity, may bring me at once to the 
end of his sad story. After an imprisonment in the 
Tower of twelve long years, he proposed to resume those

old sea voyages of his, and go to South America in 
search of gold. His Sowship, divided between his wish 
to be on good terms with the Spaniards, through whose 
territory Sir Walter must pass (he had long had an 
idea of marrying Prince Henry to a Spanish Princess), 
and his avaricious eagerness to get hold of the gold, 
did not know what to do. But, in the end, he set Sir 
Walter free, taking securities for his return ; and Sir 
Walter fitted out an expedition at his own cost, and, on 
the twenty-eighth of March, one thousand six hundred 
and seventeen, sailed away in command of one of its 
ships, which he ominously called the Destiny. The 
expedition failed; the common men, not finding the 
gold they had expected, mutinied ; a quarrel broke out 
between Sir Walter and the Spaniards, who hated him 
for old successes of his against them ; and he took and 
burnt a little town called Saint Thomas. For this he 
was denounced to his Sowship by the Spanish Ambas- 
sador as a pirate ; and returning almost broken-hearted, 
with his hopes and fortunes shattered, his company of 
friends dispersed, and his brave son (who had been one 
of them) killed, he was taken through the treachery of 
Sir Lewis Stukely, his near relation, a scoundrel and 
a Vice-Admiral, and was once again immured in his 
prison-home of so many years.

His Sowship being mightily disappointed in not 
getting any gold, Sir Walter Kaleigh was tried as 
unfairly, and with as many lies and evasions, as the 
judges and law officers and every other authority in 
Church and State habitually practised under such a 
King. After a great deal of prevarication on all parts 
but his own, it was declared that he must die under 
his former sentence, now fifteen years old. So, on the 
twenty-eighth of October, one thousand six hundred 
and eighteen, he was shut up in the Gate House at 
Westminster to pass his last night on earth, and there 
he took leave of his good and faithful lady, who was 
worthy to have lived in better days. At eight o’clock 
next morning, after a cheerful breakfast, and a pipe, 
and a cup of good wine, he was taken to Old Palace 
Yard in Westminster, where the scaffold was set up, 
and where so many people of high degree were assem- 
bled to see him die, that it was a matter of some diffi* 
culty to get him through the crowd. He behaved most 
nobly : but, if anything lay heavy on his mind, it was 
that Earl of Essex, whose head he had seen roll off *, 
and he solemnly said that he had had no hand in 
bringing him to the block, and that he had shed tears 
for him when he died. As the morning was very cold, 
the Sheriff said, would he come down to a fire for a

little space and warm himself? But Sir Walter 
thanked him, and said no, he would rather it were 
done at once : for he was ill of fever and ague, and in 
another quarter of an hour his shaking fit would come 
upon him if he were still alive, and his enemies might 
then suppose that he trembled for fear. With that, he 
kneeled and made a very beautiful and Christian 
prayer. Before he laid his head upon the block, he 
felt the edge of the axe and said, with a smile upon 
his face, that it was a sharp medicine, but would cure 
the worst disease. When he was bent down ready for 
death, he said to the executioner, finding that he hesi- 
tated, “ What dost thou fear ? Strike, man ! ” So, 
the axe came down and struck his head off, in the sixty- 
sixth year of his age. 

The new favorite got on fast. He was made a 
viscount, he was made Duke of Buckingham, he was 
made a marquis, he was made Master of the Horse, he 
was made Lord High Admiral — and the Chief Com- 
mander of the gallant English forces that had dispersed 
the Spanish Armada, was displaced to make room for 
him. He had the whole kingdom at his disposal, and 
his mother sold all the profits and honours of the State, 
as if she had kept a shop. He blazed all over with 
diamonds and other precious stones, from his hat-band

jtnd his ear-rings to his shoes. Yet he was an ignorant, 
presumptuous, swaggering compound of knave and fool, 
with nothing but his beauty and his dancing to recom- 
mend him. This is the gentleman who called himself 
his Majesty’s dog and slave, and called his Majesty 
Your Sowship. His Sowship called him Steenie ; it 
is supposed, because that was a nickname for Stephen, 
and because St. Stephen was generally represented in 
pictures as a handsome saint. 

His Sowship was driven sometimes to his wits’-end 
by his trimming between the general dislike of the 
Catholic religion at home, and his desire to wheedle and 
flatter it abroad, as his only means of getting a rich 
princess for his son’s wife : a part of whose fortune he 
might cram into his greasy pockets. Prince Charles — 
or as his Sowship called him, Baby Charles — being now 
Prince of Wales, the old project of a marriage with 
the Spanish King’s daughter had been revived for him ; 
and as she could not marry a Protestant without leave 
from the Pope, his Sowship himself secretly and meanly 
wrote to his Infallibility, asking for it. The negotiation 
for this Spanish marriage takes up a larger space in 
great books than you can imagine, but the upshot of 
it all is, that when it had been held off by the Spanish 
Court for a long time, Baby Charles and Steenie set off

in disguise as Mr. Thomas Smith and Mr. John Smith, 
to see the Spanish Princess ; that Baby Charles pre- 
tended to be desperately in love with her, and jumped 
off walls to look at her, and made a considerable idiot 
of himself in . a good many ways ; that she was called 
Princess of Wales, and that the whole Spanish Court 
believed Baby Charles to be all but dying for her sake, 
as he expressly told them he was ; that Baby Charles 
and Steenie came back to England, and were received 
with as much rapture as if they had been a blessing 
to it ; that Baby Charles had actually fallen in love 
with Henrietta Maria, the French King’s sister, whom 
he had seen in Paris ; that he thought it a wonderfully 
fine and princely thing to have deceived the Spaniards, 
all through ; and that he openly said, with a chuckle, 
as soon as he was safe and sound at home again, that 
the Spaniards were great fools to have believed him. 

Like most dishonest men, the Prince and the 
favorite complained that the people whom they had 
deluded were dishonest. They made such misrepre- 
sentations of the treachery of the Spaniards in this 
business of the Spanish match, that the English nation 
became eager for a war with them. Although the 
gravest Spaniards laughed at the idea of his Sowship 
in a warlike attitude, the Parliament granted money for

the beginning of hostilities, and the treaties with Spain 
were publicly declared to be at an end. The Spanish 
ambassador in London- — probably with the help of the 
fallen favorite, the Earl of Somerset — being unable to 
obtain speech with his Sowship, slipped a paper into 
his hand, declaring that he was a prisoner in his own 
house and was entirely governed by Buckingham and 
his creatures. The first effect of this letter was, that 
his Sowship began to cry and whine, and took Baby 
Charles away from Steenie, and went down to Windsor, 
gabbling all sorts of nonsense. The end of it was that 
his Sowship hugged his dog and slave, and said he was 
quite satisfied. 

He had given the Prince and the favorite almost 
unlimited power to settle anything with the Pope as to 
the Spanish marriage ; and he now, with a view to the 
French one, signed a treaty that all Roman Catholics 
in England should exercise their religion freely, and 
should never be required to take any oath contrary 
thereto. In return for this, and for other concessions 
much less to be defended, Henrietta Maria was to 
become the Prince’s wife, and was to bring him a 
fortune of eight hundred thousand crowns. 

His Sowship’s eyes were getting red with eagerly 
looking for the money, when the end of a gluttonous

life came upon him ; and, after a fortnight’s illness, on 
Sunday the twenty- seventh of March, one thousand six 
hundred and twenty-five, he died. He had reigned 
twenty-two years, and was fifty-nine years old. I know 
of nothing more abominable in history than the adula- 
tion that was lavished on this King, and the vice and 
corruption that such a barefaced habit of lying produced 
in his court. It is much to be doubted whether one 
man of honour, and not utterly self-disgraced, kept his 
place near James the First. Lord Bacon, that able 
and wise philosopher, as the First Judge in the Kin g- 
dom in this reign, became a public spectacle of dis- 
honesty and corruption ; and in his base flattery of his 
Sowship, and in. his crawling servility to his dog and 
slave, disgraced himself even more. But, a creature 
like his Sowship set upon a throne is like the Plague,

CHARLES THE FIRST,

CHAPTER XXXIII. 

ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST. 

Baby Charles became King Charles the First, 
in the twenty-fifth year of his age. Unlike his father, 
he was usually amiable in his private character, and 
grave and dignified in his bearing ; but, like his father, 
he had monstrously exaggerated notions of the rights 
of a king, and was evasive, and not to be trusted. If 
his word could have been relied upon, his history might 
have had a different end. 

His first care was to send over that insolent upstart, 
Buckingham, to bring Henrietta Maria from Paris to 
be his Queen; upon which occasion Buckingham — 
with his usual audacity — made love to the young Queen 
of Austria, and was very indignant indeed with Car- 
dinal Richelieu, the French Minister, for thwarting 
his intentions. The English people were very well 
disposed to like their new Queen, and to receive her 
with great favor when she came among them as a 
stranger. But, she held the Protestant religion in 
great dislike, and brought over a crowd of unpleasant 
priests, who made her do some very ridiculous things.

and forced themselves upon the public notice in many 
disagreeable ways. Hence, the people soon came to 
dislike her, and she soon came to dislike them; and 
she did so much all through this reign in setting the 
King (who was dotingly fond of her) against his subjects, 
that it would have been better for him if she had never 
been born. 

Now, you are to understand that King Charles the 
First — of his own determination to be a high and 
mighty King not to be called to account by anybody, 
and urged on by his Queen besides — deliberately set 
himself to put his Parliament down and to put himself 
up. You are also to understand, that even in pursuit 
of this wrong idea (enough in itself to have ruined any 
king) he never took a straight course, but always took 
a crooked one. 

He was bent upon war with Spain, though neither 
the House of Commons nor the people were quite clear 
as to the justice of that war, now that they began to 
think a little more about the story of the Spanish 
match. But the King rushed into it hotly, raised 
money by illegal means to meet its expenses, and 
encountered a miserable failure at Cadiz in the very 
first year of his reign. An expedition to Cadiz had 
been made in the hope of plunder, but as it was not

Successful, it was necessary to get a grant of money 
from the Parliament ; and when they met, in no very 
complying humour, the King told them, “ to make 
haste to let him have it, or it would be the worse for 
themselves.** Not put in a more complying humour 
by this, they impeached the King’s favorite, the Duke 
of Buckingham, as the cause (which he undoubtedly 
was) of many great public grievances and wrongs, The 
King, to save him, dissolved the Parliament without 
getting the money he wanted ; and when the Lords 
•implored him to consider and grant a little delay, he 
replied, “No, not one minute.” He then began to 
raise money for himself by the following means among 
others. 

He levied certain duties called tonnage and poundage 
which had not been granted by the Parliament, and 
could lawfully be levied by no other power ; he called 
upon the sea-port towns to furnish, and to pay all the 
costs for three months of, a fleet of armed ships ; and 
he required the people to unite in lending him large 
sums of money, the repayment of which was very 
doubtful. If the poor people refused, they were pressed 
as soldiers or sailors ; if the gentry refused, they were 
sent to prison. Five gentlemen, named Sir Thomas 
Darnel, John Corbet, Walter Earl, John Heven*

ingham, and Everabd Hampden, for refusing were 
taken up by a warrant of the King's privy council, and 
sent to prison without any cause but the King's plea- 
sure being stated for their imprisonment. Then the 
question came to be solemnly tried, whether this was 
not a violation of Magna Charta, and an encroachment 
by the King on the highest rights of the English 
people. His lawyers contended No, because to 
encroach upon the rights of the English people would 
be to do wrong, and the King could do no wrong. The 
accommodating judges decided in favor of this wicked 
nonsense; and here was a fatal division between the 
King and the people. 

For all this, it became necessary to call another 
Parliament. The people, sensible of the danger in 
which their liberties were, chose for it those who were 
best known for their determined opposition to the 
King; but still the King, quite blinded by his deter- 
mination to carry everything before him, addressed 
them when they met in a contemptuous manner, and 
just told them, in so many words, that he had only 
called them together because he wanted money. The 
Parliament, strong enough and resolute enough to 
know that they would lower his tone, cared little for 
what he said, and laid before him one of the great

documents of history, which is called the Petition of 
Right, requiring that the free men of England should 
no longer be called upon to lend the King money, and 
should no longer be pressed or imprisoned for refusing 
to do so ; further, that the free men of England should 
no longer be seized by the King’s special mandate or 
warrant, it being contrary to their rights and liberties 
and the laws of their country. At first the King 
returned an answer to this petition, in which he tried 
to shirk it altogether; but, the House of Commons 
then showing their determination to go on with the 
impeachment of Buckingham, the King, in alarm, 
returned an answer, giving his consent to all that was 
required of him. He not only afterwards departed 
from his wofcd and honor on these points, over and 
over again; but, at this very time, he did the mean 
and dissembling act of publishing his first answer and 
not his second — merely that the people might suppose 
that the Parliament had not got the better of him. 

That pestilent Buckingham, to gratify his own 
wounded vanity, had by this time involved the country 
in war with France, as well as with Spain. For such 
miserable causes and such miserable creatures are wars 
sometimes made ! But he was destined to do little 
more mischief in this world. One morning as he was

going out of his house to his carriage, he turned to 
speak to a certain Colonel Fryer who was with him; 
and was violently stabbed with a knife, which the 
murderer left sticking in his heart. This happened 
in his hall. He had had angry words up stairs, just 
before, with some French gentlemen, who were imme* 
diately suspected by his servants, and had a close 
escape from being set upon and killed. In the midst 
of the noise, the real murderer, who had gone to the 
kitchen, and might easily have got away, drew his 
sword and cried out, I am the man ! ” His name 
was John Felton, a Protestant and a retired officer in 
the army. He said he had had no personal ill will to 
the Duke, but had killed him as a curse to the country. 
He had aimed his blow well, for Buckingham had only 
had time to cry out, “ Villain ! ” and then he drew out 
the knife, fell against a table, and died. 

The council made a mighty business of examining 
John Felton about this murder, though it was a plain 
case enough, one would think. He had come seventy 
miles to do it, he told them, and he did it for the 
reason he had declared; and if they put him upon the 
rack, as that noble Marquis of Dorset whom he saw 
before him, had the goodness to threaten, he gave that 
marquis warning, that he would accuse him as his

accomplice. The King was unpleasantly anxious to 
have him racked nevertheless ; but as the judges now 
found out that torture was contrary to the law of Eng- 
land — it is a pity they did not make the discovery 
a little sooner — John Felton was simply executed for 
the murder he had done. A murder it undoubtedly 
was, and not in the least to be defended : though he 
had freed England from one of the most profligate, 
contemptible, and base court favorites to whom it has 
ever yielded. 

A very different man now arose. This was Sir 
Thomas Wentworth, a Yorkshire gentleman, who 
had sat in Parliament for a long time, and who had 
favored arbitrary and haughty principles, but who had 
gone over to the people’s side on receiving offence from 
Buckingham. The King, much wanting such a man 
—for, besides being naturally favorable to the King’s 
cause, he had great abilities — made him first a Baron, 
and then a Viscount, and gave him high employment, 
and won him most completely. 

A Parliament, however, was still in existence, and 
was not to be won. On the twentieth of January, one 
thousand six hundred and twenty-nine, Sir John 
Eliot, a great man who had been active in the Petition 

of Right, brought forward other strong resolutions

against the King’s chief instruments, and called upon 
the Speaker to put them to the vote. To this the 
Speaker answered, “ he was commanded otherwise by 
the King,” and got up to leave the chair — which, 
according to the rules of the House of Commons 
would have obliged it to adjourn without doing any- 
thing more — when two members, named Mr. Hollis 
and Mr. Valentine, held him down. A scene of great 
confusion arose among the members ; and while many 
swords were drawn and flashing about, the King, who 
was kept informed of all that was going on, told the 
captain of his guard to go down to the House and force 
the doors. The resolutions were by that time, how- 
ever, voted, and the House adjourned. Sir John Eliot 
and those two members who had held the Speaker 
down, were quickly summoned before the council. As 
they claimed it to be their privilege not to answer out 
of Parliament for anything they had said in it, they 
were committed to the Tower. The King then went 
down and dissolved the Parliament, in a speech wherein 
he made mention of these gentlemen as “Vipers” — 
which did not do him much good that ever I have 
heard of. 

As they refused to gain their liberty by saying 
they were sorry for what they had done, the King,

always remarkably unforgiving, never overlooked their 
offence. When they demanded to be brought up before 
the Court of King's Bench, he even resorted to the 
meanness of having them moved about from prison to 
prison, so that the writs issued for that purpose should 
not legally find them. At last they came before the 
court and were sentenced to heavy fines, and to be 
imprisoned during the King's pleasure. When Sir 
John Eliot’s health had quite given way, and he so 
longed for change of air and scene as to petition for 
his release, the King sent back the answer (worthy of 
his Sowship himself) that the petition was not humble 
enough. When he sent another petition by his young 
son, in which he pathetically offered to go back to 
prison when his health was restored, if he might be 
released for its recovery, the King still disregarded it. 
When he died in the Tower, and his children petitioned 
to be allowed to take his body down to Cornwall, there 
to lay it among the ashes of his forefathers, the King 
returned for answer, “Let Sir John Eliot’s body be 
buried in the church of that parish where he died.’' 
All this was like a very little King indeed, I think. 

And now, for twelve long years, steadily pursuing 
his design of setting himself up and putting the people 
down, the King called no Parliament ; but ruled without

one. If twelve thousand volumes were written in his 
praise (as a good many have been) it would still remain 
a fact, impossible to be denied, that for twelve years 
King Charles the First reigned in England unlawfully 
and despotically, seized upon his subjects* goods and 
money at his pleasure, and punished, according to his 
unbridled will, all who ventured to oppose him. It is 
a fashion with some people to think that this King’s 
career was cut short; but I must say myself that I 
think he ran a pretty long one. 

William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, was the 
King’s right-hand man in the religious part of the 
putting down of the people’s liberties. Laud, who 
was a sincere man, of large learning but small sense — 
for the two things sometimes go together in very 
different quantities — though a Protestant, held opinions 
so near those of the Catholics, that the Pope wanted 
to make a Cardinal of him, if he would have accepted 
that favour. He looked upon vows, robes, lighted 
candles, images, and so forth, as amazingly important 
in religious ceremonies; and he brought in an im- 
mensity of bowing and candle -snuffing. He also 
regarded archbishops and bishops as a sort of 
miraculous persons, and was inveterate in the last 
degree against any who thought otherwise. Accord-

ingly, he offered up thanks to Heaven, and was in a 
state of much pious pleasure, when a Scotch clergy- 
man named Leighton, was pilloried, whipped, branded 
in the cheek, and had one of his ears cut off, and one 
of his nostrils slit, for calling bishops trumpery and 
the inventions of men. He originated on a Sunday 
morning the prosecution of William Prynne, a 
barrister, who was of similar opinions, and who was 
fined a thousand pounds ; who was pilloried ; who had 
his ears cut off on two occasions — one ear at a time — 
and who was imprisoned for life. He highly approved 
of the punishment of Doctor Bastwick, a physician ; 
who was also fined a thousand pounds ; and who after- 
wards had his ears cut off, and was imprisoned for life. 
These were gentle methods of persuasion, some will 
tell you : still, I think they were rather calculated to 
be alarming to the people. 

In the money part of the putting down of the 
people’s liberties, the King was equally gentle, as 
some will tell you : still, as I think, equally alarming. 
He levied those duties of tonnage and poundage, and 
increased them as he thought fit. He granted 
monopolies to companies of merchants on their pay- 
ing him for them, notwithstanding the great complaints 
that had, for years and years, been made on the subject

of monopolies. He fined the people for disobeying 
proclamations issued by his Sowship in direct violation 
of the law. He revived the detested Forest laws* and 
took private property to himself as his forest right. 
Above all, he determined to have what was called Ship 
Money ; th&t is to say, money for the support of the 
fleet — not only from the seaports, but from all the 
counties of England; having found out that, in some 
ancient time or other, all the counties paid it. The 
grievance of this ship money being somewhat too 
strong, John Chambers, a citizen of London, refused 
to pay his part of it. For this the Lord Mayor 
ordered John Chambers to prison, and for that John 
Chambers brought a suit against the Lord Mayor. 
Lord Say, also, behaved like a real nobleman, and 
declared he would not pay. But, the sturdiest and 
best opponent of the ship money was John Hampden, 
a gentleman of Buckinghamshire, who had sat among 
the vipers in the House of Commons when there was 
such a thing, and who had been the bosom friend of 
. Sir John Eliot. This case was tried before the twelve 
judges in the Court of Exchequer; and again the 
King’s lawyers said it was impossible that ship money 
could be wrong, because the King could do no wrong, 
however hard he tried — and he really did try very hard

during these twelve years. Seven of the judges said 
that was quite true, and Mr. Hampden was bound to 
pay: five of the judges said that was quite false, and 
Mr. Hampden was not bound to pay. So the King 
triumphed (as he thought), by making Hampden the 
most popular man in England ; where matters were 
getting to that height now, that many honest English- 
men could not endure their country, and sailed away 
across the seas, to found a colony in Massachusetts 
Bay in America. It is said that Hampden himself and 
his relation Oliver Cromwell were going with a 
company of such voyagers, and were actually on board 
ship ; when they were stopped by a proclamation, pro- 
hibiting sea captains to carry out such passengers 
without the royal license. But Oi it would have been 
well for the King if he had let them go ! 

This was the state of England. If Laud had been 
a madman just broke loose, he could not have done 
more mischief than he did in Scotland. In his endea- 
vours (in which he was seconded by the King, then in 
person in that part of his dominions) to force his own 
ideas of bishops, and his own religious forms and cere- 
monies, upon the Scotch, he roused that nation to a 
perfect frenzy. They formed a solemn league, which 
they called The Covenant, for the preservation of their

own religious forms; they rose in arms throughout the 
whole country; they summoned all their men to 
prayers and sermons twice-a-day by heat of drum ; they 
sang psalms, in which they compared their enemies to 
all the evil spirits that ever were heard of ; and they 
solemnly vowed to smite them with the sword. At 
first the King tried force, then treaty, then a Scottish 
Parliament, which did not answer at all. Then he 
tried the Earl of Strafford, formerly Sir Thomas 
Wentworth; who, as Lord Wentworth, had been 
governing Ireland. He, too, had carried it with a very 
high hand there, though, it must be frankly admitted, 
to the benefit and prosperity of that country. 

Strafford, and Laud were, of course, for conquering 
the Scottish people by force of arms. Other lords who 
were taken into council, recommended that a Parlia- 
ment should at last he called; to which the King 
unwillingly consented. So, on the thirteenth of April, 
one thousand six hundred and forty, that then strange 
sight, a Parliament, was seen at Westminster. It is 
called the Short Parliament, for it lasted a very little 
while. While the members were all looking at one 
another, doubtful who would dare to speak, Mr. Pym 
arose and set forth all that the King had done unlaw- 
fully during the past twelve years, and what was the

185 


position to which England was then reduced. This 
great example set, other members took courage and 
spoke the truth freely, though with great patience and 
moderation. The King, a little frightened, sent to say 
that if they would grant him a certain sum on certain 
terms, no more ship money should be raised. They 
debated the matter for two days ; and then, as they 
would not give him all he asked without promise or 
enquiry, he dissolved them. 

But they knew very well that he must-have a Par- 
liament now ; and he began to make that discovery too, 
though rather late in the day. Wherefore, on the 
twenty-fourth of September, being then at York with 
an army collected against the Scottish people, but 
sullen and discontented like the rest of the nation, the 
King told a great council of the Lords, whom he had 
called to meet him there, that he would summon 
another Parliament to assemble on the third of 
November. The soldiers of the Covenant had now forced 
their way into England and had taken possession of 
the northern counties, where the coals are got : so, as 
it would never do to be without coals, and as the King’s 
troops could make no head against. the Covenanters so 
full of gloomy zeal, a truce was made, and a treaty with 
Scotland was taken into consideration. Meanwhile the

northern counties paid the Covenanters to leave the 
coals alone, and keep quiet. 

We have now disposed of the Short Parliament. 
We have next to see what memorable things were done 
by the Long one. 


Second Part. 

The Long Parliament assembled on the third of 
November, one thousand six hundred and forty-one. 
That day week the Earl of Strafford arrived from 
York, very sensible that the spirited and determined 
men who formed that Parliament were no friends 
towards him, who had not only deserted the cause of 
the people, but who had, on all occasions, opposed 
himself to their liberties. The King told him, for his 
comfort, that the parliament “ should not hurt one hair 
of his head.” But, on the very next day Mr. Pym, in 
the House of Commons, and with great solemnity, 
impeached the Earl of Strafford as a traitor. He was 
immediately taken into custody and fell from his proud 
height in a moment. 

It was the twenty-second of March before he was 
brought to trial in Westminster Hall ; where, although

he was very ill and suffered great pain, he defended 
himself with such ability and majesty, that it was 
doubtful whether he would not get the best of it after 
all. But on the thirteenth day of the trial, Pym 
produced in the House of Commons a copy of some 
notes of a council, found by young Sir Harry Vane 
in a red velvet cabinet belonging to his father 
(Secretary Vane, who sat at the council table with the 
Earl), in which Strafford had distinctly told the King 
that he was free from all rules and obligations of 
government, and might do with his people whatever 
he liked ; and in which he had added — “ You have an 
army in Ireland that you may employ to reduce this 
kingdom to obedience.” It was not clear whether by 
the words “ this kingdom,” he had really meant England 
or Scotland ; but the Parliament contended that he 
meant England, and of course this was treason. At 
the same sitting of the House of Commons it was 
resolved to bring in a bill of attainder declaring the 
treason to have been committed: in preference to 
proceeding with the trial by impeachment, which would 
have required the treason to be proved. 

So a bill was brought in at once, was carried through 
the House of Commons by a large majority, and was 
sent up to the House of Lords. While it was still

188 A child’s HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 

uncertain whether the House of Lords would pass it 
and the King consent to it, Pym disclosed to the 
House of Commons that the King and Queen had both 
been plotting with the officers of the army to bring up 
the soldiers and control the Parliament, and also to 
introduce two hundred soldiers into the Tower of 
London, to effect the Earl’s escape. The plotting 
with the army was revealed by one George Goring, 
the son of a lord of that name : a bad fellow, who was 
one of the original plotters, and turned traitor. The 
King had actually given his warrant for the admission 
of the two hundred men into the Tower, and they 
would have got in too but for the refusal of the 
governor — a sturdy Scotchman of the name of Balfour 
— to admit them. These matters being made public, 
great numbers of people began to riot outside the 
Houses of Parliament, and to cry out for the execution 
of the Earl of Strafford, as one of the King’s chief 
instruments against them. The bill passed the House 
of Lords while the people were in this state of agitation, 
and was laid before the King for his assent, together 
with another bill, declaring that the Parliament then 
assembled should not be dissolved or adjourned with- 
out their own consent. The King — not unwilling to 
save a faithful servant, though he had no great attach-

ment for him — was in some doubt what to do ; but he 
gave his consent to both bills, although he in his heart 
believed that the bill against the Earl of Strafford was 
unlawful and unjust. The Earl had written to him, 
telling him that he was willing to die for his sake. 
But he had not expected that his royal master would 
take him at his word quite so readily ; for, when he 
heard his doom, he laid his hand upon his heart, and 
said, “ Put not your trust in Princes ! ” 

The King, who never could be straightforward and 
plain, through one single day or through one single 
sheet of paper, wrote a letter to the Lords, and sent it 
by the young Prince of Wales, entreating them to 
prevail with the Commons that “ that unfortunate man 
should fulfil the natural course of his life in a close 
imprisonment.” In a postscript to the very same 
letter, he added, “If he must die, it were charity to 
reprieve him till Saturday.” If there had been any 
doubt of his fate, this weakness and meanness would 
have settled it. The very next day, which was the 
twelfth of May, he was brought out to be beheaded on 
Tower Hill. 

Archbishop Laud, who had been so fond of having 
people’s ears cropped off and their noses slit, was now 
confined in the Tower too ; and, when the Earl went

by bis window to bis death, be was there, at bis 
request, to give him bis blessing. They bad been 
great Mends in the Kings cause, and the Earl bad 
written to him, in the days of their power, that he 
thought it would be an admirable thing to have Mr. 
Hampden publicly whipped for refusing to pay the 
ship money. However, those high and mighty doings 
were over now, and the Earl went his way to death 
with dignity and heroism. The governor wished him 
to get into a coach at the Tower gate, for fear the 
people should tear him to pieces ; but he said it was 
all one to him whether he died by the axe or by their 
hands. So, he walked, with a firm tread and a stately 
look, and sometimes pulled off his hat to them as he 
passed along. They were profoundly quiet. He made 
a speech on the scaffold from some notes he had pre- 
pared (the paper was found lying there after his head 
was struck off), and one blow of the axe killed him, in 
the forty-ninth year of his age. 

This bold and daring act, the Parliament accom- 
panied by other famous measures, all originating (as 
even this did) in the King’s having so grossly and so 
long abused his power. The name of Delinquents 
was applied to all sheriffs and other officers who had 
been concerned in raising the ship money, or any other

money, from the people, in an unlawful manner; the 
Hampden judgment was reversed ; the judges who had 
decided against Hampden were called upon to give 
large securities that they would take such consequences 
as Parliament might impose upon them ; and one was 
arrested as he sat in High Court, and carried off to 
prison. Laud was impeached ; the unfortunate victims 
whose ears had been cropped and whose noses had 
been slit, were brought out of prison in triumph ; and 
a bill was passed declaring that a Parliament should 
be called every third year, and that if the King and 
the King’s officers did not call it, the people should 
assemble of themselves and summon it, as of their 
own right and power. Great illuminations and rejoic- 
ings took place over all these things, and the country 
was wildly excited. That the Parliament took advan- 
tage of this excitement and stirred them up by every 
means, there is no doubt; but you are always to 
remember those twelve long years, during which the 
King had tried so hard whether he really could do any 
wrong or not. 

All this time there was a great religious outcry 
against the right of the Bishops to sit in Parliament ; 
to which the Scottish people particularly objected. 
The English were divided on this subject, and, partly

on this account and partly because they had had foolish 
expectations that the Parliament would be able to take 
off nearly all the taxes, numbers of them sometimes 
wavered and inclined towards the King. 

I believe myself, that if, at this or almost any other 
period of his life, the King could have been trusted by 
any man not out of his senses, he might have saved 
himself and kept his throne. But, on the English 
army being disbanded, he plotted with the officers 
again, as he had done before, and established the fact 
beyond all doubt, by putting his signature of approval 
to a petition against the Parliamentary leaders, which 
was drawn up by certain officers. When the Scottish 
army was disbanded, he went to Edinburgh in four 
days — which was going very fast at that time — to plot 
again, and so darkly too, that it is difficult to decide 
what his whole object was. Some suppose that he 
wanted to gain over the Scottish Parliament, as he did 
in fact gain over, by presents and favors, many Scottish 
lords and men of power. Some think that he went to 
get proofs against the Parliamentary leaders in England 
of their having treasonably invited the Scottish people 
to come and help them. With whatever object he went 
to Scotland, he did little good by going. At the insti- 
gation of the Earl of Montrose, a desperate man who

CHARLES THE FIRST.

was then in prison for plotting, he tried to kidnap three 
Scottish lords, who escaped. A committee of the Par- 
liament at home, who had followed to watch him, writing 
an account of this Incident, as it was called, to the 
Parliament, the Parliament made a fresh stir about it ; 
were, or feigned to be, much alarmed for themselves ; 
and wrote to the Earl of Essex, the commander-in- 
chief, for a guard to protect them. 

It is not absolutely proved that the King plotted in 
Ireland besides, but it is very probable that he did, and 
that the Queen did too ; and that he had some wild 
hope of gaining the Irish people over to his side by 
favoring a rise among them. Whether or no, they 
did rise in a most brutal and savage rebellion; 
in which, encouraged by their priests, they com- 
mitted such atrocities upon numbers of the English, of 
both sexes and of all ages, as nobody could believe, but 
for their being related, on oath, by eye-witnesses. 
Whether one hundred thousand or two hundred thou- 
sand Protestants were murdered in this outbreak, is 
uncertain ; but, that it was as ruthless and barbarous 
an outbreak as ever was known among any savage 
people on earth, is absolutely certain. 

The King came home from Scotland, determined to 

make a great struggle for his lost power. He believed

that, through his presents and favors, Scotland would 
take no part against him; and the Lord Mayor of 
London received him with such a magnificent dinner 
that he thought he must have become popular again in 
England. It would take a good many Lord Mayors, 
however, to make a people, and the King soon found 
himself mistaken. 

Not so soon, though, but that there was a great 
opposition in the Parliament to a celebrated paper put 
forth by Pym and Hampden and the rest, called “ The 
Remonstrance,” which set forth all the illegal acts 
that the King had ever done ; but politely laid the blame 
of them on his bad advisers. Even when it was passed 
and presented to him, the King still thought himself 
strong enough to discharge Balfour from his command 
in the Tower, and to put in his place a man of bad 
character : to whom the Commons instantly objected, 
and whom he was obliged to abandon. At this time, 
the old outcry about the Bishops became louder than 
ever ; and the old Archbishop of York was so near 
being murdered as he went down to the House of 
Lords — being laid hold of by the mob and violently 
knocked about, in return for very foolishly scolding a 
shrill boy who was yelping out “ No Bishops ! ” — that 
he sent for all the Bishops who were in town, and pro*

posed to them to sign a declaration that, as they could 
no longer without danger to their lives, attend their 
duty in Parliament, they protested against the lawful- 
ness of everything done in their absence. This they 
asked the King to send to the House of Lords, which 
he did. Then the House of Commons impeached the 
whole party of Bishops and sent them off to the Tower. 

Taking no warning from this ; hut encouraged by 
there being a moderate party in the Parliament who 
objected to these strong measures, the King, on the 
third of January, one thousand six hundred and forty- 
two, took the rashest step that ever was taken by 
mortal man. 

Of his own accord and without advice, he sent the 
Attorney- General to the House of Lords to accuse of 
treason certain members of Parliament, who, as popular 
leaders, were the most obnoxious to him ; Lord Kim- 
bolton, Sir Arthur Haselrig, Denzil Hollis, John 
Pym (they used to call him King Pym, he possessed 
such power and looked so big), John Hampden, and 
William Strode. The houses of these members he 
caused to be entered, and their papers to be sealed up. 
At the same time, he sent a messenger to the House of 
Commons demanding to have the five gentlemen who 

were members of that House immediately produced.

To this the House replied that they should appear as 
soon as there was any legal charge against them, and 
immediately adjourned. 

Next day, the House of Commons send into the City 
to let the Lord Mayor know that their privileges are 
invaded by the King, and that there is no safety for 
anybody or anything. Then, when the five members 
are gone out of the way, down comes the King himself, 
with all his guard and from two to three hundred gen- 
tlemen and soldiers, of whom the greater part were 
armed. These he leaves in the hall ; and then, with his 
nephew at his side, goes into the House, takes off his 
hat, and walks up to the Speaker's chair. The Speaker 
leaves it, the King stands in front of it, looks about him 
steadily for a little while, and says he has come for 
those five members. No one speaks, and then he calls 
John Pym by name. No one speaks, and then he calls 
Denzil Hollis by name. No one speaks, and then he 
asks the Speaker of the House where those five 
members are ? The Speaker, answering on his knee, 
nobly replies that he is the servant of that House, and 
that he has neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak, 
anything but what the House commands him. Upon 
this, the King, beaten from that time evermore, replies 
that he will seek them himself, for they have committed

treason ; and goes out, with his hat in his hand, amid 
some audible murmurings from the members. 

No words can describe the hurry that arose out of 
doors when all this was known. The five members 
had gone for safety to a house in Coleman-street, in the 
City, where they were guarded all night ; and indeed 
the whole city watched in arms like an army. At ten 
o’clock in the morning the King, already frightened at 
what he had done, came to the Guildhall, with only 
half-a-dozen lords, and made a speech to the people, 
hoping that they would not shelter those whom he 
accused of treason. Next day, he issued a proclama- 
tion for the apprehension of the five members ; but the 
Parliament minded it so little that they made great 
arrangements for having them brought down to West- 
minster in great state, five days afterwards. The King 
was so alarmed now at his own imprudence, if not for 
his own safety, that he left his palace at Whitehall, and 
went away with his Queen and children to Hampton 
Court. 

It was the eleventh of May, when the five members 
were carried in state and triumph to Westminster. 
They were taken by water. The river could not be 
seen for the boats on it ; and the five members were 
hemmed in by barges full of men and great guns, ready

to protect them, at any cost. Along the Strand a largd 
body of the train-bands of London, under their com* 
mander, Skippon, marched to be ready to assist the 
little fleet. Beyond them, came a crowd who choked 
the streets, roaring incessantly about the Bishops and 
the Papists, and crying out contemptuously as they 
passed Whitehall, “ What has become of the King ? ” 
With this great noise outside the House of Commons* 
and with great silence within, Mr. Pym rose and in- 
formed the House of the great kindness with which 
they had been received in the City. Upon that, the 
House called the sheriffs in and thanked them, and 
requested the train-bands, under their commander 
Skippon, to guard the House of Commons every day. 
Then, came four thousand men on horseback out of 
Buckinghamshire, offering their services as a guard 
too ; and bearing a petition to the King, complaining 
of the injury that had been done to Mr. Hampden, 
who was their county man and much beloved and 
honored. 

When the King set off for Hampton Court, the 
gentlemen and soldiers who had been with him, 
followed him out of town as far as Kingston-upon- 
Thames ; and, next day, Lord Digby came to them 
from the King at Hampton Court, in his coach and

six, to inform them that the King accepted their 
protection. This, the Parliament said, was making 
war against the kingdom, and Lord Digby fled abroad. 
The Parliament then immediately applied themselves 
to getting hold of the military power of the country, 
well knowing that the Kang was already trying hard 
to use it against them, and had secretly sent the 
Earl of Newcastle to Hull, to secure a valuable 
magazine of arms and gunpowder that was there. 
In those times, every county had its own magazines 
of arms and powder, for its own train-bands or 
militia ; so, the Parliament brought in a bill claiming 
the right (which up to this time had belonged to the 
King) of appointing the Lord Lieutenants of coun- 
ties, who commanded these train-bands; and, also, 
of having all the forts, castles, and garrisons in the 
kingdom, put into the hands of such governors as 
they, the Parliament, could confide in. It also passed 
a law depriving the Bishops of their votes. The 
King gave his assent to that bill ; but would not 
abandon the right of appointing the Lord Lieutenants, 
though he said he was willing to appoint such as 
might be suggested to him by the Parliament* When 
the Earl of Pembroke asked him whether he would 
not give way on that question for a time, he said,

“ By God ! not for one hour ! ” and upon this he and 
the Parliament went to war. 

His young daughter was betrothed to the Prince 
of Orange. On pretence of taking her to the country 
of her future husband, the Queen was already got 
safely away to Holland, there to pawn the Crown 
jewels for money to raise an army on the King’s 
side. The Lord Admiral being sick, the House of 
Commons now named the Earl of Warwick to hold 
his place for a year. The King named another 
gentleman ; the House of Commons took its own way, 
and the Earl of Warwick became Lord Admiral 
without the King’s consent. The Parliament sent 
orders down to Hull to have that magazine removed 
to London ; the King went down to Hull to take it 
himself. The citizens would not admit him into the 
town, and the governor would not admit him into the 
castle. The Parliament resolved that whatever the 
two Houses passed, and the King would not consent 
to, should be called an Ordinance, and should be as 
much a law as if he did consent to it. The King 
protested against this, and gave notice that these 
ordinances were not to be obeyed. The King, attended 
by the majority of the House of Peers, and by many 
members of the House of Commons, established him-

self at York. The Chancellor went to him with the 
Great Seal, and the Parliament made a new Great 
Seal. The Queen sent over a ship full of arms and 
ammunition, and the King issued letters to borrow 
money at high interest. The Parliament raised twenty 
regiments of foot and seventy-five troops of horse; 
and the people willingly aided them with their money, 
plate, jewellery, and trinkets — the married women 
even with their wedding-rings. Every member of 
Parliament who could raise a troop or a regiment in 
his own part of the country, dressed it according to 
his taste and in his own colors, and commanded it. 
Foremost among them all, Oliver Cromwell raised 
a troop of horse — thoroughly in earnest and thoroughly 
well armed — who were, perhaps, the best soldiers that 
ever were seen. 

In some of their proceedings, this famous Parliament 
unquestionably passed the bounds of all previous law 
and custom, yielded to and favored riotous assemblages 
of the people, and acted tyrannically in imprisoning 
some who differed from the popular leaders. But 
again, you are always to remember that the twelve 
years during which the Kang had had his own wilful 
way, had gone before; and that nothing could make 
the times what they might, could, would, or should

have been, if those twelve years had never rolled 
away. 


Third Part. 

I shall not try to relate the particulars of the great 
civil war between King Charles the First and the 
Long Parliament, which lasted nearly four years, and 
a full account of which would fill many large books* 
It was a sad thing that Englishmen should once more 
be fighting against Englishmen on English ground; 
but, it is some consolation to know that on both sides 
there was great humanity, forbearance, and honor. 
The soldiers of the Parliament were far more remark- 
able for these good qualities than the soldiers of the 
King (many of whom fought for mere pay without 
much caring for the cause) ; but those of the nobility 
and gentry who were on the King’s side were so brave, 
and so faithful to him, that their conduct cannot 
but command our highest admiration. Among these 
were great numbers of Catholics, who took the royal 
side because the Queen was so strongly of their 
persuasion. 

The King might have distinguished some of these

gallant spirits, if he had been as generous a spirit 
himself, by giving them the command of his army. 
Instead of that, however, true to his old high notions 
of royalty, he entrusted it to his two nephews, Prince 
Rupert and Prince Maurice, who were of royal blood, 
and came over from abroad to help him. It might 
have been better for him if they had stayed away; 
since Prince Rupert was an impetuous hot-headed 
fellow, whose only idea was to dash into battle at all 
times and seasons, and lay about him. 

The general-in-chief of the Parliamentary army 
Was the Earl of Essex, a gentleman of honor and 
an excellent soldier. A little while before the war 
broke out, there 'had been some rioting at West- 
minster between certain officious law students and 
noisy soldiers, and the shopkeepers and their appren- 
tices, and the general people in the streets. At that 
time the King’s friends called the crowd, Roundheads, 
because the apprentices wore short hair; the crowd, 
in return, called their opponents Cavaliers, meaning 
that they were a blustering set, who pretended to be 
very military. These two words now began to be

them Malignants, and spoke of themselves as the 
Godly, the Honest, and so forth. 

The war broke out at Portsmouth, where that double 
traitor Goring had again gone over to the King and 
was besieged by the Parliamentary troops. Upon this, 
the King proclaimed the Earl of Essex and the officers 
serving under him, traitors, and called upon his loyal 
subjects to meet him in arms at Nottingham on the 
twenty-fifth of August. But his loyal subjects came 
about him in scanty numbers, and it was a windy 
gloomy day, and the Royal Standard got blown down, 
and the whole affair was very melancholy. The chief 
engagements after this, took place in the vale of 
the Red Horse near Banbury, * at Brentford, at 
Devizes, at Chalgrave Field (where Mr. Hampden 
was so sorely wounded while fighting at the head of 
liis . men, that he died within a week), at Newbury 
(in which battle Lord Falkland, one of the best 
noblemen on the King’s side, was killed), at Leicester, 
at Naseby, at Winchester, at Marston Moor near 
York, at Newcastle, and in many other parts of 
England and Scotland. These battles were attended 
with various successes. At one time the King was 
victorious ; at another time the Parliament. But 
almost all the great and busy towns were against the

King ; and when it was considered necessary to fortify 
London, all ranks of people, from labouring men and 
women up to lords and ladies, worked hard together 
with heartiness and good-will. The most distinguished 
leaders on the Parliamentary side were Hampden, 
Sm Thomas Fairfax, and, above all, Oliver Crom- 
well, and his son-in-law Ireton. 

During the whole of this war, the people, to whom 
it was very expensive and irksome, and to whom it was 
made the more distressing by almost every family 
being divided — some of its members attaching them- 
selves to one side and some to the other — were over 
and over again most anxious for peace. So were some 
of the best men in each cause. Accordingly, treaties 
of peace were discussed between commissioners from 
the Parliament and the King; at York, at Oxford 
(where the King held a little Parliament of his own), 
and at Uxbridge. But they came to nothing. In all 
these negotiations, and in all his difficulties, the King 
showed himself at his best. He was courageous, cool, 
self-possessed and clever; but, the old taint of his 
character was always in him, and he was never for 
one single moment to be trusted. Lord Clarendon, the 
historian, one of his highest admirers, supposes that 
he had unhappily promised the Queen never to make

peace without her consent, and that this must often 
be taken as his excuse. He never kept his word from 
night to morning. He signed a cessation of hostilities 
with the blood-stained Irish rebels for a sum of money, 
and invited the Irish regiments over, to help him 
against the Parliament. In the battle of Naseby, his 
cabinet was seized and was found to contain a corre* 
spondence with the Queen, in which he expressly told 
her that he had deceived the Parliament — a mongrel 
Parliament, he called it now, as an improvement on 
his old term of vipers — in pretending to recognise it 
and to treat with it ; and from which it further appeared 
that he had been long in secret treaty with the Duke 
of Lorraine for a foreign army of ten thousand men. 
Disappointed in this, he sent a most devoted friend of 
his, the Earl of Glamorgan, to Ireland, to conclude 
a secret treaty with the Catholic powers, to send him 
an Irish army of ten thousand men; in return for 
which he was to bestow great favors on the Catholic 
religion. And, when this treaty was discovered in the 
carriage of a fighting Irish Archbishop, who was killed 
in one of the many skirmishes of those days, he basely 
denied and deserted his attached friend, the Earl, on 
his being charged with high treason ; and — even worse 
than this — had left blanks in the secret instructions he

gave him with his own kingly hand, expressly that he 
might thus save himself. 

At last, on the twenty-seventh day of April, one 
thousand six hundred and forty-six, the King found 
himself in the city of Oxford, so surrounded by the 
Parliamentary army who were closing in upon him on 
all sides, that he felt that if he would escape, he must 
delay no longer. So, that night, having altered the 
cut of his hair and beard, he was dressed up as a 
servant and put upon a horse with a cloak strapped 
behind him, and rode out of the town behind one of 
his own faithful followers, with a clergyman of that 
country, who knew the road well, for a guide. He 
rode towards London as far as Harrow, and then 
altered his plans, and resolved, it would seem, to go 
to the Scottish camp. The Scottish men had been 
invited over to help the Parliamentary army, and had 
a large force then in England. The King was so des- 
perately intriguing in everything he did, that it is 
doubtful what he exactly meant by this step. He took 
it, anyhow, and delivered himself up to the Earl of 
Leven, the Scottish general-in-chief, who treated him 
as an honorable prisoner. Negotiations between the 
Parliament on the one hand and the Scottish autho- 
rities on the other, as to what should be done with

him, lasted until the following February. Then, when 
the King had refused to the Parliament the concession 
of that old militia point for twenty years, and had 
refused to Scotland the recognition of its Solemn 
League and Covenant, Scotland got a handsome sum 
for its army and its help, and the King into the 
bargain. He was taken by certain Parliamentary 
commissioners, appointed to receive him, to one of his 
own houses, called Holmby House, near Althorpe, in 
N orthampton shire . 

While the Civil War was still in progress, John Pym 
died, and was buried with great honor in Westminster 
Abbey — not with greater honor than he deserved, for 
the liberties of Englishmen owe a mighty debt to 
Pym and Hampden. The war was but newly over 
when the Earl of Essex died, of an illness brought 
on by his having overheated himself in a stag hunt 
in Windsor Forest. He, too, was buried in West- 
minster Abbey, with great state. I wish it were not 
necessary to add that Archbishop Laud died upon 
the scaffold when the war was not yet done. His 
trial lasted in all nearly a year, and, it being doubtful 
even then whether the charges brought against him 
amounted to treason, the odious old contrivance of the 
worst kings was resorted to, and a bill of attainder

was brought in against him. He was a violently 
prejudiced and mischievous person ; had had strong 
ear-crop ping and nose- slitting propensities, as you 
know ; and had done a world of harm. But he died 
peaceably, and like a brave old man. 


Fourth Part. 

When the Parliament had got the King into their 
hands, they became very anxious to get rid of their 
army, in which Oliver Cromwell had begun to acquire 
great power; not only because of his courage and high 
abilities, but because' he professed to be very sincere 
in the Scottish sort of Puritan religion that was then 
exceedingly popular among the soldiers. They were 
as much opposed to the Bishops as to the Pope 
himself ; and the very privates, drummers, and trum- 
peters, had such an inconvenient habit of starting up 
and preaching long-winded discourses, that I would 
not have belonged to that army on any account. 

So, the Parliament, being far from sure but that 
the army might begin to preach and fight against 
them now it had nothing else to do, proposed to 

disband the greater part of it, to send another part

to serve in Ireland against the rebels, and to keep 
only a small force in England. But, the army would 
not consent to be broken up, except upon its own 
conditions; and, when the Parliament showed an 
intention of compelling it, it acted for itself in an 
unexpected manner. A certain comet, of the name of 
Joice, arrived at Holmby House one night, attended 
by four hundred horsemen, went into the King’s room 
with his hat in one hand and a pistol in the other, 
and told the King that he had come to take him 
away. The King was willing enough to go, and only 
stipulated that he should be publicly required to do 
so next morning. Next morning, accordingly, he 
appeared on the top of the steps of the house, and 
asked Cornet Joice before his men and the guard set 
there by the Parliament, what authority he had for 
taking him away? To this Comet Joice replied, “ The 
authority of the army.” “ Have you a written com- 
mission ? ” said the King. Joice, pointing to his four 
hundred men on horseback, replied, “ That is my 
commission.” “ Well,” said the King smiling, as if he 
were pleased, “ I never before read such a commission ; 
but it is written in fair and legible characters. This 
is a company of as handsome proper gentlemen as 
I have seen a long while.” He was asked where he

would like to live, and he said at Newmarket. So, 
to Newmarket he, and Cornet Joice, and the four 
hundred horsemen, rode ; the King remarking, in the 
same smiling way, that he could ride as far at a spell 
as Cornet Joice, or any man there. 

The King quite believed, I think, that the army 
were his friends. He said as much to Fairfax when 
that general, Oliver Cromwell, and Ireton, went to 
persuade him to return to the custody of the Parlia- 
ment. He preferred to remain as he was, and resolved 
to remain as he was. And when the army moved 
nearer and nearer London to frighten the Parliament 
into yielding to their, demands, they took the King 
with them. It was a deplorable thing that England 
should be at the mercy of a great body of soldiers 
with arms in their hands; but the King certainly 
favored them at this important time of his life, as 
compared with the more lawful power that tried to con- 
trol him. It must be added, however, that they 
treated him, as yet, more respectfully and kindly 
than the Parliament had ever done. They allowed 
him to be attended by his own servants, to be splen- 
didly entertained at various houses, and to see his 
children — at Cavesham House, near Reading — for two 
days. Whereas, the Parliament had been rather hard

with him, and had only allowed him to ride out and 
play at bowls. 

It is much to be believed that if the King could 
have been trusted, even at this time, he might have 
been saved. Even Oliver Cromwell expressly said 
that he did believe that no man could enjoy his pos- 
sessions in peace, unless the King had his rights. 
He was not unfriendly towards the King ; he had been 
present when he received his children, and had been 
much affected by the pitiable nature of the scene; 
he saw the King often ; he frequently walked and 
talked with him in the long galleries and pleasant 
gardens of the Palace at Hampton Court, whither he 
was now removed; and in all this risked something 
of his influence with the army. But, the King was in 
secret* hopes of help from the Scottish people ; and 
the moment he was encouraged to join them he began 
to be cool to his new friends, the army, and to tell 
the officers that they could not possibly do without 
him. At the very time, too, when he was promising 
to make Cromwell and Ireton noblemen, if they would 
help him up to his old height, he was writing to the 
Queen that he meant to hang them. They both after- 
wards declared that they had been privately informed 
that such a letter would be found, on a certain

evening, sewn up in a saddle, which would be taken 
to the Blue Boar in Holborn to be sent to Dover; 
and that they went there, disguised as common sol- 
diers, and sat drinking in the inn-yard until a man 
came with the saddle, which they ripped up with 
their knives, and therein found the letter. I see little 
reason to doubt the story. It is certain that Oliver 
Cromwell told one of the King’s most faithful followers 
that the King could not be trusted, and that he would 
not be answerable if anything amiss were to happen 
to him. Still, even after that, he kept a promise he 
had made to the King, by letting him know that there 
was a plot with a certain portion of the army to seize 
him. I believe that, in fact, he sincerely wanted the 
King to escape abroad, and so to be got rid of without 
more trouble or danger. That Oliver himself had 
work enough with the army is pretty plain ; for some 
of the troops were so mutinous against him, and 
against those who acted with him at this time, that 
he found it necessary to have one man shot at the 
head of his regiment to overawe the rest. 

The King, when he received Oliver’s warning, made 
his escape from Hampton Court; and, after some 
indecision and uncertainty, went to Carisbrooke Castle 
in the Isle of Wight. At first, he was pretty free

there; but, even there, he carried on a pretended 
treaty with the Parliament, while he was really treating 
with commissioners from Scotland to send an army 
into England to take his part. When he broke off 
this treaty with the Parliament (having settled with 
Scotland) and was treated as a prisoner, his treatment 
was not changed too soon, for he had plotted to escape 
that very night to a ship sent by the Queen, which was 
lying off the island. 

He was doomed to be disappointed in his hopes 
from Scotland. The agreement he had made with the 
Scottish Commissioners was not favorable enough to 
the religion of that country to please the Scottish 
clergy ; and they preached against it. The consequence 
was, that the army raised in Scotland and sent over, 
was too small to do much ; and that, although it was 
helped by a rising of the Royalists in England and 
by good soldiers from Ireland, it could make no head 
against the Parliamentary army under such men as 
Cromwell and Fairfax. The King’s eldest son, the 
Prince of Wales, came over from Holland with nine- 
teen ships (a part of the English fleet having gone 
over to him) to help his father ; but nothing came of 
his voyage, and he was fain to return. The most 
remarkable event of this second civil war was the

cruel execution by the Parliamentary General, of 
Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle, two 
gallant Royalist generals, who had bravely defended 
Colchester under every disadvantage of famine and 
distress for nearly three months. When Sir Charles 
Lucas was shot, Sir George Lisle kissed his body, 
and said to the soldiers who were to shoot him, 
“Come nearer, and make sure of me.” “I warrant 
you, Sir George,” said one of the soldiers, “we shall 
hit you.” “Aye?” he returned with a smile, “ but I 
have been nearer to you, my friends, many a time, and 
you have missed me.” 

The Parliament, after being fearfully bullied by the 
army — who demanded to have seven members whom 
they disliked given up to them — had voted that they 
would have nothing more to do with the King. On the 
conclusion, however, of this second civil war (which 
did not last more than six months), they appointed 
commissioners to treat with him. The King, then so 
far released again as to be allowed to live in a private 
house at Newport in the Isle of Wight, managed his 
own part of the negotiation with a sense that was 
admired by all who saw him, and gave up, in the end 
all that was asked of him — even yielding (which he 
had steadily refused, so far) to the temporary abolition

of the bishops and the transfer of their church land 
to the Crown. Still, with his old fatal vice upon him, 
when his best friends joined the commissioners in 
beseeching him to yield all those points as the only 
means of saving himself from the army, he was plotting 
to escape from the island; he was holding corre- 
spondence with his friends and the Catholics in 
Ireland, though declaring that he was not ; and 
he was writing, with his own hand, that in what 
he yielded he meant nothing but to get time to 
escape. 

Matters were at this pass when the army, resolved 
to defy the Parliament, marched up to London. The 
Parliament, not afraid of them now, and boldly led by 
Hollis, voted that the King’s concessions were suffi- 
cient ground for settling the peace of the kingdom. 
Upon that, Colonel Eich and Colonel Pride went 
down to the House of Commons with a regiment of 
horse soldiers and a regiment of foot : and Colonel 
Pride, standing in the lobby with a list of the members 
who were obnoxious to the army in his hand, had them 
pointed out to him as they came through, and took 
them all into custody. This proceeding was after- 
wards called by the people, for a joke, Pride’s Purge. 
Cromwell was in the North, at the head of his men, at

the time, but when he came home, approved of what 
had been done. 

What with imprisoning some members and causing 
others to stay away, the army had now reduced the 
House of Commons to some fifty or so. These soon 
voted that it was treason in a king to make war against 
his parliament and his people, and sent an ordinance 
up to the House of Lords for the King’s being tried 
as a traitor. The House of Lords, then sixteen in 
number, to a man rejected it. Thereupon, the Com- 
mons made an ordinance of their own, that they were 
the supreme government of the country, and would 
bring the King to trial. 

The King had been taken for security to a place 
called Hurst Castle : a lonely house on a rock in the 
sea, connected with the coast of Hampshire by a rough 
road two miles long at low water. Thence he was 
ordered to be removed to Windsor ; thence, after being 
but rudely used there, and having none but soldiers 
to wait upon him at table, he was brought up to 
St. James’s Palace in London, and told that his trial 
was appointed for next day. 

On Saturday, the twentieth of January, one thousand 
six hundred and forty-nine, this memorable trial began. 
The House of Commons had settled that one hundred

and thirty-five persons should form the Court, and 
these were taken from the House itself, from among 
the officers of the army, and from among the lawyers 
and citizens. John Bradshaw, serjeant-at-law, was 
appointed president. The place was Westminster 
Hall. At the upper end in a red velvet chair, sat the 
president, with his hat (lined with plates of iron for 
his protection) on his head. The rest of the Court 
sat on side benches, also wearing their hats. The 
King’s seat was covered with velvet, like that of the 
president, and was opposite to it. He was brought 
from St. James’s to Whitehall, and from Whitehall 
he came by water, to his trial. 

When he came in, he looked round very steadily on 
the Court, and on the great number of spectators, 
and then sat down : presently he got up and looked 
round again. On the indictment “ against Charles 
Stuart, for high treason,” being read, he smiled several 
times, and he denied the authority of the Court, saying 
that there could be no parliament without a House 
of Lords, and that he saw no House of Lords there. 
Also that the King ought to be there, and that he saw 
no King in the King’s right place. Bradshaw replied, 
that the Court was satisfied with its authority, and 
that its authority w r as God’s authority and the king-

dom’s. He then adjourned the Court to the following 
Monday. On that da} r , the trial was resumed, and 
went on all the week. When the Saturday came, as 
the King passed forward to his place in the Hall, 
some soldiers and others cried for “justice!” and 
execution on him. That day, too, Bradshaw, like an 
angry Sultan, wore a red robe, instead of the black 
one he had worn before. The King was sentenced to 
death that day. As he went out, one solitary soldier 
said, “God bless you, Sir!” For this, his officer 
struck him. The King said he thought the punishment 
exceeded the offence. The silver head of his walking- 
stick had fallen off while he leaned upon it, at one time 
of the trial. The accident seemed to disturb him, 
as if he thought it ominous of the falling of his own 
head ; and he admitted as much, now it was all over. 

Being taken back to Whitehall he sent to the 
House of Commons, saying that as the time of his 
execution might be nigh, he wished he might be 
allowed to see his darling children. It was granted. 
On the Monday he was taken back to St. James’s ; 
and his two children then in England, the Princess 
Elizabeth thirteen years old, and the Duke of 
Gloucester nine years old, were brought to take 
leave of him, from Sion House, near Brentford. It

was a sad and touching scene, when he kissed and 
fondled these poor children, and made a little present 
of two diamond seals to the Princess, and gave them 
tender messages to their mother (who little deserved 
them, for she had a lover of her own whom she married 
soon afterwards), and told them that he died “ for the 
laws and liberties of the land.” I am bound to 
say that I don’t think he did, but I dare say he 
believed so. 

There were ambassadors from Holland that day, 
to intercede for the unhappy King, whom you and 
I both wish the Parliament had spared ; but they got 
no answer. The Scottish Commissioners interceded 
too ; so did the Prince of Wales, by a letter in which 
he offered as the next heir to the throne, to accept 
any conditions from the Parliament ; so did the Queen 
by letter likewise. Notwithstanding all, the warrant 
for the execution was this day signed. There is a 
story that as Oliver Cromwell went to the table with 
the pen in his hand to put his signature to it, he 
drew his pen across the face of one of the commis- 
sioners who was standing near, and marked it with ink. 
That commissioner had not signed his own name yet, 
and the story adds, that when he came to do it, he 
marked Cromwell’s face with ink in the same way.

The King slept well, untroubled by the knowledge that 
it was his last night on earth, and rose on the thirtieth 
of January, two hours before day, and dressed himself 
carefully. He put on two shirts lest he should tremble 
with the cold, and had his hair very carefully combed. 
The warrant had been directed to three officers of the 
army, Colonel Hacker, Colonel Hunks, and Colonel 
Phayer. At ten o’clock, the first of these came to the 
door and said it was time to go to Whitehall. The 
Kin g, who had always been a quick walker, walked at 
his usual speed through the Park, and called out to the 
guard, with his accustomed voice of command, “ March 
on apace !” When he came to Whitehall, he was taken 
to his own bed-room, where a breakfast was set forth. 
As he had taken the Sacrament, he would eat nothing 
more; but, at about the time when the church bells 
struck twelve at noon (for he had to wait, through the 
scaffold not being ready), he took the advice of the 
good Bishop Juxon who was with him, and ate a little 
bread, and drank a glass of claret. Soon after he had 
taken this refreshment, Colonel Hacker came to the 
chamber with the warrant in his hand, and called for 
Charles Stuart. 

And then, through the long gallery of Whitehall 
Palace, which he had often seen light and gay and

merry and crowded, in very different times, the fallen 
King passed along, until he came to the centre window 
of the Banqueting House, through which he emerged 
upon the scaffold, which was hung with black. He 
looked at the two executioners, who were dressed in 
black and masked; he looked at the troops of soldiers 
on horseback and on foot, who all looked up at him in 
silence; he looked at the vast array of spectators, filling 
up the view beyond, and turning all their faces upon 
him; he looked at his old Palace of St. James’s; and 
he looked at the block. He seemed a little troubled to 
find that it was so low, and asked, “if there were no 
place higher?” Then, to those upon the scaffold, he 
said “ that it was the Parliament who had begun the 
war, and not he ; but he hoped they might be guiltless 
too, as ill instruments had gone between them. In 
one respect,” he said, “he suffered justly ; and that was 
because he had permitted an unjust sentence to be 
executed on another.” In this he referred to the Earl 
of Strafford. 

He was not at all afraid to die ; but he was anxious 
to die easily. When some one touched the axe while 
he was speaking, he broke off and called out, “Take 
heed of the axe ! take heed of the axe ! ” He also said 
to Colonel Hacker, “ Take care that they do not put

me to pain.” He told the executioner, “ I shall say 
but very short prayers, and then thrust out my hands” 
— as the sign to strike. 

He put his hair up, under a white satin cap which 
the bishop had carried, and said, “ I have a good 
cause and a gracious God on my side.” The bishop 
told him that he had but one stage more to travel in 
this weary world, and that, though it was a turbulent 
and troublesome stage, it was a short one, and would 
carry him a great way — all the way from earth to 
Heaven. The King’s last word, as he gave his cloak 
and the George — the decoration from his breast — to 
the bishop, was this, “ Remember ! ” He then kneeled 
down, laid his head upon the block, spread out his 
hands, and was instantly killed. One universal groan 
broke from the crowd; and the soldiers, who had sat 
on their horses and stood in their ranks immovable as 
statues, were of a sudden all in motion, clearing the 
streets. 

Thus in the forty-ninth year of his age, falling at 
the same time of his career as Strafford had fallen in 
his, perished Charles the First. With all my sorrow 
for him, I cannot agree with him that he died “ the 
martyr of the people;” for the people had been martyrs 
to him, and his ideas of a King’s rights, long before.

Indeed I am afraid that he was but a bad judge of 
martyrs ; for he had called that infamous Duke of 
Buckingham “ the Martyr of his Sovereign.” 


CHAPTER XXXIV. 

ENGLAND UNDER OLIVER CROMWELL. 

Before sunset on the memorable day on which 
King Charles the First was executed, the House of 
Commons passed an act declaring it treason in any 
one to proclaim the Prince of Wales — or anybody else 
— King of England. Soon afterwards, it declared that 
the House of Lords was useless and dangerous, and 
ought to be abolished ; and directed that the late King’s 
statue should be taken down from the Royal Exchange 
in the city and other public places. Having laid hold 
of some famous Royalists who had escaped from 
prison, and having beheaded the Duke of Hamilton, 
Lord Holland, and Lord Capel, in Palace Yard (all 
of whom died very courageously), they then appointed 
a Council of State to govern the country. It consisted 
of forty-one members, of whom five were peers. 
Bradshaw was made president. The House of Com- 
mons also re -admitted members who had opposed the

King’s death, and made up its numbers to about a 
hundred and fifty. 

But, it still had an army of more than forty thousand 
men to deal with, and a very hard task it was to manage 
them. Before the King’s execution, the army had 
appointed some of its officers to remonstrate between 
them and the Parliament ; and now the common soldiers 
began to take that office upon themselves. The regi- 
ments under orders for Ireland mutinied ; one troop of 
horse in the city of London seized their own flag, and 
refused to obey orders. For this, the ringleader was 
shot: which did not mend the matter, for, both his 
comrades and the people made a public funeral for 
him, and accompanied the body to the grave with 
sound of trumpets and with a gloomy procession of 
persons carrying bundles of rosemary steeped in blood, 
Oliver was the only man to deal with such difficulties 
as these, and he soon cut them short by bursting at 
midnight into the town of Burford, near Salisbury, 
where the mutineers were sheltered, taking four 
hundred of them prisoners, and shooting a number 
of them by sentence of court-martial. The soldiers 
soon found, as all men did, that Oliver was not a man 
to be trifled with. And there was an end of the 
mutiny.

The Scottish Parliament did not know Oliver yet ; 
so, on hearing of the King’s execution, it proclaimed 
the Prince of Wales King Charles the Second, on 
condition of his respecting the Solemn League and 
Covenant. Charles was abroad at that time, and so 
was Montrose, from whose help he had hopes enough 
to keep him holding on and off with commissioners 
from Scotland, just as his father might have done. 
These hopes, however, were soon at an end ; for, 
Montrose, having raised a few hundred exiles in 
Germany, and landed with them in Scotland, found 
that the people there, instead of joining him, deserted 
the country fct his approach. He was soon taken 
prisoner and carried to Edinburgh. There he was 
received with every possible insult, and carried to 
prison in a cart, his officers going two and two before 
him. He was sentenced by the Parliament to be 
hanged on a gallows thirty feet high, to have his head 
set on a spike in Edinburgh, and his limbs distributed 
in other places, according to the old barbarous manner. 
He said he had always acted under the Royal orders, 
and only wished he had limbs enough to be distributed 
through Christendom, that it might be the more widely 
known how loyal he had been. He went to the scaffold 
in a bright and brilliant dress, and made a bold end at

thirty-eight years of age. The breath was scarcely 
out of his body when Charles abandoned his memory, 
and denied that he had ever given him orders to rise 
in his behalf. Oh, the family failing was strong in 
that Charles then ! 

Oliver had been appointed by the Parliament to 
command the army in Ireland, where he took a terrible 
vengeance for the sanguinary rebellion, and made 
tremendous havoc, particularly in the siege of Drogheda, 
where no quarter was given, and where he found at 
least a thousand of the inhabitants shut up together in 
the great church: every one of whom was killed by 
his soldiers, usually known as Oliver's Ironsides. 
There were numbers of friars and priests among them, 
and Oliver gruffly wrote home in his despatch that 
these were “ knocked on the head ” like the rest. 

But, Charles having got over to Scotland, where the 
men of the Solemn League and Covenant led him a 
prodigiously dull life, and made him very weary with 
long sermons and grim Sundays, the Parliament called 
the redoubtable Oliver home to knock the Scottish 
men on the head for setting up that Prince. Oliver 
left his son-in-law, Ireton, as general in Ireland in his 
stead (he died there afterwards), and he imitated the 
example of his father-in-law with such goodwill that

he brought the country to subjection, and laid it at the 
feet of the Parliament. In the end, they passed an act 
for the settlement of Ireland, generally pardoning all 
the common people, but exempting from this grace 
such of the wealthier sort as had been concerned in 
the rebellion, or in any killing of Protestants, or who 
refused to lay down their arms. Great numbers of 
Irish were got out of the country to serve under 
Catholic powers abroad, and a quantity of land was 
declared to have been forfeited by past offences, and 
was given to people who had lent money to the 
Parliament early in the war. these were sweeping 
measures; but, if Oliver Cromwell had had his own 
way fully, and had stayed in Ireland, he would have 
done more yet. 

However, as I have said, the Parliament wanted 
Oliver for Scotland; so, home Oliver came, and was 
made Commander of all the Forces of the Common- 
wealth of England, and in three days away he went 
with sixteen thousand soldiers to fight the Scottish 
men. Now, the Scottish men, being then — as you 
will generally find them now — mighty cautious, re- 
flected that the troops they had were not used to war 
like the Ironsides, and would be beaten in an open 
fight. Therefore they said, “If we lie quiet in our

trenches in Edinburgh here, and if all the farmers 
come into the town and desert the country, the Iron- 
sides will be driven out by iron hunger and be forced 
to go away.” This was, no doubt, the wisest plan; 
but as the Scottish clergy would interfere with what 
they knew nothing about, and would perpetually preach 
long sermons, exhorting the soldiers to come out and 
fight, the soldiers got it in their heads that they 
absolutely must come out and fight. Accordingly, in 
an evil hour for themselves, they came out of their 
safe position. Oliver fell upon them instantly, and 
killed three thousand, and took ten thousand prisoners. 

To gratify the Scottish Parliament, and preserve 
their favor, Charles had signed a declaration they 
laid before him, reproaching the memory of his father 
and mother, and representing himself as a most 
religious Prince, to whom the Solemn League and 
Covenant was as dear as life. He meant no sort of 
truth in this, and soon afterwards galloped away on 
horseback to join some tiresome Highland friends, 
who were always flourishing dirks and broadswords. 
He was overtaken and induced to return; but this 
attempt, which was called “ The start,” did him just 
so much service, that they did not preach quite such 
long sermons at him afterwards as they had done before.

On the first of January, one thousand six hundred 
and fifty-one, the Scottish people crowned him at 
Scone. He immediately took the chief command of 
an army of twenty thousand men, and marched to 
Stirling. His hopes were heightened, I dare say, by 
the redoubtable Oliver being ill of an ague; but 
Oliver scrambled out of bed in no time, and went to 
work with such energy that he got behind the Royalist 
army and cut it off from all communication with 
Scotland. There was nothing for it then, but to go 
on to England; so it went on as far as Worcester, 
where the mayor and some of the gentry proclaimed 
King Charles the Second straightway. His pro- 
clamation, however, was of little use to him, for very 
few Royalists appeared; and, on the very same day, 
two people were publicly beheaded on Tower Hill for 
espousing his cause. Up came Oliver to Worcester 
too, at double quick speed, and he and his Ironsides 
so laid about them in the great battle which was fought 
there, that they completely beat the Scottish men, and 
destroyed the Royalist army ; though the Scottish men 
fought so gallantly that it took five hours to do. 

The escape of Charles after this battle of Worcester 
did him good service long afterwards, for it induced 
many of the generous English people to take a romantic

interest in him, and to think much better of him than 
he ever deserved. He fled in the night with not more 
than sixty followers to the house of a Catholic lady 
in Staffordshire. There, for his greater safety, the 
whole sixty left him. He cropped his hair, stained 
his face and hands brown as if they were sunburnt, 
put on the clothes of a labouring countryman, and 
went out in the morning with his axe in his hand, 
accompanied by four wood-cutters who were brothers, 
and another man who was their brother-in-law. These 
good fellows made a bed for him under a tree, as the 
weather was very bad ; and the wife of one of them 
brought him food to eat ; and the old mother of the 
four brothers came and fell down on her knees before 
him in the wood, and thanked God that her sons 
were engaged in saving his life. At night, he 'came 
out of the forest and went on to another house which 
was near the river Severn, with the intention of 
passing into Wales; but the place swarmed with 
soldiers, and the bridges were guarded, and all the 
boats were made fast. So, after lying in a hayloft 
covered over with hay, for some time, he came out 
of this place, attended by Colonel Careless, a Catho- 
lic gentleman who had met him there, and with whom 
he lay hid, all next day, up in the shady branches of

a fine old oak. It was lucky for the King that" it was 
September-time, and that the leaves had not begun to 
fall, as he and the Colonel, perched up in this tree, 
could catch glimpses of the soldiers riding about below, 
and could hear the crash in the wood as they went 
about beating the boughs. 

After this, he walked and walked until his feet were 
all blistered ; and, having been concealed all one day 
in a house which was searched by the troopers while 
he was there, went with Lord Wilmot, another of his 
good friends, to a place called Bentley, where one 
Miss Lane, a Protestant lady, had obtained a pass 
to be allowed to ride through the guards to see a rela- 
tion of hers near Bristol. Disguised as a servant, he 
rode on the saddle before this young lady to the house 
of Sm John Winter, while Lord Wilmot rode there 
boldly, like a plain country gentleman, with dogs at 
his heels. It happened that Sir John Winter’s butler 
had been a servant in Richmond Palace, and knew 
Charles the moment he set eyes upon him; but, the 
butler was faithful, and kept the secret. As no ship 
could be found there to carry him abroad, it was planned 
that he should go — still travelling with Miss Lane as 
her servant — to another house, at Trent near Sher- 
borne in Dorsetshire ; and then Miss Lane and her

cousin, Mr. Lascelles, who had gone on horseback 
beside her all the way, went home. I hope Miss Lane 
was going to marry that cousin, for I am sure she 
must have been a brave, kind girl. If I had been that 
cousin, I should certainly have loved her. 

When Charles, lonely for the loss of Miss Lane, 
was safe at Trent, a ship was hired at Lyme, the 
master of which engaged to take two gentlemen to 
France. In the evening of the same day, the King — 
now riding as servant before another young lady — 
set off for a public -house at a place called Charmouth, 
where the captain of the vessel was to take him on 
board. But, the captain’s wife, being afraid of her 
husband’s getting into trouble, locked him up and 
would not let him sail. Then they went away to 
Bridport; and, coming to the inn there, found the stable- 
yard full of soldiers who were on the look out for 
Charles, and who talked about him while they drank. 
He had such presence of mind, however, that he led 
the horses of his party through the yard as any other 
servant might have done, and said, “ Come out of the 
way, you soldiers ; let us have room to pass here ! ’•’ As 
he went along, he met a half-tipsy ostler, who rubbed 
his eyes and said to him, “Why, I was formerly 
servant to Mr. Potter at Exeter, and surely I have

sometimes seen you there, young man ? ” He certainly 
had, for Charles had lodged there. His ready answer 
was, “ Ah, I did live with him once ; but I have no 
time to talk now. We’ll have a pot of beer together 
when I come back.” 

From this dangerous place he returned to Trent, 
and lay there concealed several days. Then he escaped 
to Heale, near Salisbury ; where, in the house of a 
widow lady, he was hidden five days, until the master 
of a collier lying off Shoreham in Sussex, undertook 
to convey a “ gentleman ” to France. On the night of 
the fifteenth of October, accompanied by two colonels 
and a merchant, the King rode to Brighton, then a 
little fishing village, to give the captain of the ship a 
supper before going on board; but, so many people 
knew him, that this captain knew him too, and not 
only he, but the landlord and landlady also. Before 
he went away, the landlord came behind his chair, 
kissed his hand, and said he hoped to live to be a lord 
and to see his wife a lady ; at which Charles laughed. 
They had had a good supper by this time, and plenty 
of snmking and drinking, at which the King was a first- 
rate hand ; so, the captain assured him that he would 
stand by him, and he did. It was agreed that the cap- 
tain should pretend to sail to Deal, and that Charles

should address the sailors and say he was a gentleman 
in debt, who was running away from his creditors, and 
that he hoped they would join him in persuading the 
captain to put him ashore in France. As the King 
acted his part very well indeed, and gave the sailors 
twenty shillings to drink, they begged the captain to 
do what such a worthy gentleman asked. He pretended 
to yield to their entreaties, and the King got safe to 
Normandy. • 

Ireland being now subdued, and Scotland kept quiet 
by plenty of forts and soldiers put there by Oliver, 
the Parliament would have gone on quietly enough as 
far as fighting with any foreign enemy went, but for 
getting into trouble with the Dutch, who in the spring 
of the year one thousand six hundred and fifty-one 
sent a fleet into the Downs under their Admiral Van 
Tromp, to call upon the bold English Admiral Blake 
(who was there with half as many ships as the Dutch) 
to strike his flag. Blake fired a raging broadside 
instead, and beat off Van Tromp ; who, in the autumn, 
came back again with seventy ships, and challenged 
the bold Blake — who still was only half as strong — to 
fight him. Blake fought him all day ; but, finding that 
the Dutch were too many for him, got quietly off at 
night. What does Yon Tromp upon this, but goes

cruising and boasting about the Channel, between the 
North Foreland and the Isle of Wight, with a great 
Dutch broom tied to his masthead, as a sign that he 
could and would sweep the English off the sea ! Within 
three months, Blake lowered his tone though, and his 
broom too ; for, he and two other bold commanders, 
Dean and Monk, fought him three whole days, took 
twenty -three of his ships, shivered his broom to pieces, 
and settled his business. # 

Things were no sooner quiet again, than the army 
began to complain to the Parliament that they were 
not governing the nation properly, and to hint that 
they thought they could do it better themselves. 
Oliver, who had now made up his mind to be at the 
head of the state, or nothing at all, supported them 
in this, and called a meeting of officers and * his own 
Parliamentary friends, at his lodgings in Whitehall, 
to consider the best way of getting rid of the Parlia- 
ment. It had now lasted just as many years as the 
King’s unbridled power had lasted, before it came 
into existence. The end of the deliberation was that 
Oliver went down to the House in his usual plain black 
dress, with his usual grey worsted stockings, but with 
an unusual party of soldiers behind him. These last 
he left in the lobby, and then went in and sat down.

Presently he got up, made the Parliament a speech, 
told them that the Lord had done with them, stamped 
his foot and said, “You are no Parliament. Bring 
them in ! Bring them in ! ” At this signal the door 
flew open, and the soldiers appeared. “ This is not 
honest,” said Sir Harry Vane, one of the members. 

“ Sir Harry Vane ! ” cried Cromwell ; “ O, Sir Harry 
Vane ! The Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane ! ” 
Then he pointed out members one by one, and said 
this man was a drunkard, and that man a dissipated 
fellow, and that man a liar, and so on. Then he 
caused the Speaker to be walked out of his chair, told 
the guard to clear the House, called the mace upon 
the table — which is a sign that the House is sitting — 

“ a fool’s, bauble,” and said, “ here, carry it away ! ” 
Being obeyed in all these orders, he quietly locked 
the door, put the key in his pocket, walked back to 
Whitehall again, and told his friends, who were still 
assembled there, what he had done. 

They formed a new Council of State after this extra- 
ordinary proceeding, and got a new Parliament toge- 
ther in their own way: which Oliver himself opened in 
a sort of sermon, and which he said was the beginning 
of a perfect heaven upon earth. I n this Parliament 
there sat a well-known leather- seller, who had taken

the singular name of Praise God Barebones, and from 
whom it was called, for a joke, Barebones’s Parliament, 
though its general name was the Little Parliament. 
As it soon appeared that it was not going to put Oliver 
in the first place, it turned out to be not at all like the 
beginning of heaven upon earth, and Oliver said it 
really was not to be borne with. So he cleared off that 
Parliament in much the same way as he had disposed 
of the other ; and then the council of officers decided 
that he must be made the supreme authority of the 
kingdom, under the title of the Lord Protector of the 
Commonwealth. 

So, on the sixteenth of December, one thousand six 
hundred and fifty-three, a great procession was formed 
at Oliver’s door, and he came out in a black velvet suit 
and a big pair of boots, and got into his coach and went 
down to Westminster, attended by the judges, and the 
lord mayor, and the aldermen, and all the other great 
and wonderful personages of the country. There, in 
the Court of Chancery, he publicly accepted the office 
of Lord Protector. Then he was sworn, and the City 
sword was handed to him, and the seal was handed to 
him, and all the other things were handed to him 
which are usually handed to Kings and Queens on 
state occasions, and handed back again. When Oliver

had handed them all back, he was quite made and com- 
pletely finished off as Lord Protector; and several of 
the Ironsides preached about it at great length, all the 
evening. 


Second Part. 

Oliver Cromwell — whom the people long called 
Old Noll — in accepting the office of Protector, had 
bound himself by a certain paper which was handed to 
him, called “the Instrument,” to summon a Parlia- 
ment, consisting of between four and five hundred 
members, in the election of which neither the Koyalists 
nor the Catholics were to have any share. He had 
also pledged himself that this Parliament should not 
be dissolved without its own consent until it had sat 
five months. 

When this Parliament met, Oliver made a speech to 
them of three hours long, very wisely advising them 
what to do for the credit and happiness of the country. 
To keep down the more violent members, he required 
them to sign a recognition of what they were forbidden 
by “the Instrument” to do; which was, chiefly, to 
take the power from one single person at the head of 
the state or to command the army. Then he dismissed

them to go to work. With his usual vigour and reso- 
lution he went to work himself with some frantic 
preachers — who were rather overdoing their sermons 
in calling him a villain and a tyrant — by shutting 
up their chapels, and sending a few of them off to 
prison. 

There was not at that time, in England or anywhere 
else, a man so able to govern the country as Oliver 
Cromwell. Although he ruled with a strong hand, and 
levied a very heavy tax on the Royalists (but not until 
they had plotted against his life), he ruled wisely, and 
as the times required. He caused England to be so 
respected abroad, that I wish some lords and gentlemen 
who have governed it under kings and queens in later 
days would have taken a leaf out of Oliver Cromwell's 
book. He sent bold Admiral Blake to the Mediter- 
ranean Sea, to make the Duke of Tuscany pay sixty 
thousand pounds for injuries he had done to British 
subjects, and spoliation he had committed on English 
merchants. He further despatched him and his fleet 
to Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, to have every English 
ship and every Englishman delivered up to him that 
had been taken by pirates in those parts. All this was 
gloriously done ; and it began to be thoroughly well 
known, all over the world, that England was governed

OLIVER CROMWELL. 241 

by a man in earnest, who would not allow the English 
name to be insulted or slighted anywhere. 

These were not all his foreign triumphs. He sent a 
fleet to sea against the Dutch; and the two powers, 
each with one hundred ships upon its side, met in the 
English Channel off the North Foreland; where the 
fight lasted all day long. Dean was killed in this fight ; 
but Monk, who commanded in the same ship with him, 
threw his cloak over his body, that the sailors might not 
know of his death, and be disheartened. Nor were 
they. Their English broadsides so exceedingly aston* 
ished the Dutch that they sheered off at last, though 
the redoubtable Van Tromp fired upon them with his 
own guns for deserting their flag. Soon afterwards, 
the two fleets engaged again, off the coast of Holland. 
There, the valiant Van Tromp was shot through the 
heart, and the Dutch gave in, and peace was made. 

Further than this, Oliver resolved not to bear the 
domineering and bigoted conduct of Spain, which 
country not only claimed a right to all the gold and 
silver that could be found in South America, and 
treated the ships of all other countries who visited those 
regions as pirates, but put English subjects into the 
horrible Spanish prisons of the Inquisition. So, Oliver 

told the Spanish ambassador that English ships must

be free to go wherever they would, and that English 
merchants must not be thrown into those same dun- 
geons, no, not for the pleasure of all the priests in 
Spain. To this, the Spanish ambassador replied that 
the gold and silver country, and the Holy Inquisition, 
were his King’s two eyes, neither of which he could 
submit to have put out. Very well, said Oliver, then 
he was afraid he must damage those two eyes directly. 

So, another fleet was despatched under two com- 
manders, Penn and Venables, for Hispaniola ; where, 
however, the Spaniards got the better of it. Conse- 
quently, the fleet came home again, after taking Jamaica 
on the way. Oliver, indignant with the two comman- 
ders who had not done what bold Admiral Blake would 
have done, clapped them both into prison, declared war 
against Spain, and made a treaty with France, in virtue 
of which it was to shelter the King and his brother the 
Duke of York no longer. Then, he sent a fleet abroad 
under bold Admiral Blake, which brought the King of 
Portugal to his senses — just to keep its hand in — and 
then engaged a Spanish fleet, sunk four great ships, 
and took two more, laden with silver to the value of 
two millions of pounds: which dazzling prize was 
brought from Portsmouth to London in waggons, with 
the populace of all the towns and villages through

248 


which the waggons passed, shouting with all their 
might. .After this victory, bold Admiral Blake sailed 
away to the port of Santa Cruz to cut off the Spanish 
treasure-ships coming from Mexico. There he found 
them, ten in number, with seven others to take care of 
them, and a big castle, and seven batteries, all roaring 
and blazing away at him with great guns. Blake cared 
no more for great guns than for pop-guns — no more for 
their hot iron balls than for snow-balls. He dashed 
into the harbour, captured and burnt every one of the 
ships, and came sailing out again triumphantly, with 
the victorious English flag flying at his mast-head. 
This was the last triumph of this great commander, 
who had sailed and fought until he was quite worn out. 
He died, as his successful ship was coming into Ply- 
mouth Harbour amidst the joyful acclamations of the 
people ; and was buried in state in Westminster Abbey* 
Not to lie there, long. 

Over and above all this, Oliver found that the 
Vaudois, or Protestant people of the valleys of 
Lucerne, were insolently treated by the Catholic 
powers, and were even put to death for their religion, 
in an audacious and bloody manner. Instantly, he 
informed those powers that this was a thing which 
Protestant England would not allow; and he speedily

carried his point through the might of his great name, 
and established their right to worship God in peace 
after their own harmless manner. 

Lastly, his English army won such admiration in 
fighting with the French against the Spaniards, that, 
after they had assaulted the town of Dunkirk together, 
the French King in person gave it up to the English, 
that it might be a token to them of their might and 
valour. 

There were plots enough against Oliver among 
the frantic religionists (who called themselves Fifth 
Monarchy Men), and among the disappointed Repub- 
licans. He had a difficult game to play, *for the 
Royalists were always ready to side with either party 
against him. The “ King over the water,” too, as 
Charles was called, had no scruples about plotting with 
anyone against his life; although there is reason to 
suppose that he would willingly have married one of 
his daughters, if Oliver would have had such a son-in- 
law. There was a certain Colonel Saxby of the army, 
once a great supporter of Oliver’s but now turned 
against him, who was a grievous trouble to him through 
all this part of his career ; and who came and went 
between the discontented in England and Spain, and 
Charles, who put himself in alliance with Spain on

being thrown off by France. This man died in prison 
at last ; but not until there had been very serious plots 
between the Royalists and Republicans, and an actual 
rising of them in England, when they burst into the 
city of Salisbury on a Sunday night, seized the judges 
who were going to hold the assizes there next day, and 
would have hanged them but for the merciful objections 
of the more temperate of their number. Oliver was so 
vigorous and shrewd that he soon put this revolt down, 
as he did most other conspiracies ; and it was well for 
one of its chief managers — that same Lord Wilmot who 
had assisted in Charles’s flight, and was now Earl of 
Rochester — that he made his escape. Oliver seemed 
to have eyes and ears everywhere, and secured such 
sources of information as his enemies little dreamed of. 
There was a chosen body of six persons, called the 
Sealed Knot, who were in the closest and most secret 
confidence of Charles. One of the foremost of these 
very men, a Sir Richard Willis, reported to Oliver 
everything that passed among them, and had two 
hundred a year for it. 

Miles Syndarcomb, also of the old army, was 
another conspirator against the Protector. He and 
a man named Cecil, bribed one of his Life Guards 
to let them have good notice when he was going out

— intending to shoot him from a window. But, owing 
either to his caution or his good fortune, they could 
never get an aim at him. Disappointed in this design, 
they got into the chapel in Whitehall, with a basketful 
of combustibles, which were to explode by means of a 
slow match in six hours; then, in the noise and 
confusion of the fire, they hoped to kill Oliver. But, 
the Life Guardsman himself disclosed this plot ; and 
they were seized, and Miles died (or killed himself in 
prison) a little while before he was ordered for exe- 
cution. A few such plotters Oliver caused to be 
beheaded, a few more to be hanged, and many more, in- 
cluding those who rose in arms against him, to be sent 
as slaves to the West Indies. If he were rigid, he 
was impartial too, in asserting the laws of England. 
When a Portuguese nobleman, the brother of the 
Portuguese ambassador, killed a London citizen in mis- 
take for another man with whom he had had a quarrel, 
Oliver caused him to be tried before a jury of English- 
men and foreigners, and had him executed in spite of 
the entreaties of all the ambassadors in London. 

One of Oliver's own friends, the Duke of Olden- 
burgh, in sending him a present of six fine coach- 
horses, was very near doing more to please the 
Royalists than all the plotters put together. One

day, Oliver went with his coach, drawn by these six 
horses, into Hyde Park, to dine with his secretary 
and some of his other gentlemen under the trees there. 
After dinner, being merry, he took it into his head to 
put them inside and to drive them home : a postillion 
riding one of the foremost horses, as the custom was. 
On account of Oliver’s being too free with the whip, 
the six fine horses went off at a gallop, the postillion 
got thrown, and Oliver fell upon the coach-pole and 
narrowly escaped being shot by his own pistol, which 
got entangled with his clothes in the harness, and went 
off. He was dragged some distance by the foot, until 
his foot came out of the shoe, and then he came safely 
to the ground under the broad body of the coach, and 
was very little the worse. The gentlemen inside were 
only bruised, and the discontented people of all parties 
were much disappointed. 

The rest of the history of the Protectorate of Oliver 
Cromwell is a history of his Parliaments. His first 
one not pleasing him at all, he waited until the five 
months were out, and then dissolved it. The next 
was better suited to his views ; and from that he desired 
to get — if he could with safety to himself — the title of 
King. He had had this in his mind some time: 
whether because he thought that the English people,

being more used to the title, were more likely to obey 
it ; or whether because he really wished to be a king 
himself, and to leave the succession to that title in his 
family, is far from clear. He was already as high, in 
England and in all the world, as he would ever be, and 
I -doubt myself if he cared for the mere name. How- 
ever, a paper, called the “ Humble Petition and Advice,” 
was presented to him by the House of Commons, 
praying him to take a high title and to appoint his 
successor. That he would have taken the title of 
King there is no doubt, but for the strong opposition 
of the army. This induced him to forbear, and to 
assent only to the other points of the petition. Upon 
which occasion there was another grand show in 
Westminster Hall, when the Speaker of the House of 
Commons formally invested him with a purple robe 
lined with ermine, and presented him with a splendidly 
bound Bible, and put a golden sceptre in his hand. 
The next time the Parliament met, he called a House 
of Lords of sixty members, as the petition gave him 
power to do ; but as that Parliament did not please 
him either, and would not proceed to the business 
of the countiy, he jumped into a coach one morning, 
took six Guards with him, and sent them to the 
right-about, I wish this had been a warning to

Parliaments to avoid long speeches, and do more 
work. 

It was the month of August, one thousand six 
hundred and fifty-eight, when Oliver Cromwell’s favo- 
rite daughter, Elizabeth Claypole (who had lately 
lost her youngest son), lay very ill, and his mind was 
greatly troubled, because he loved her dearly. Another 
of his daughters was married to Lord Falconberg, 
another to the grandson of the Earl of Warwick, and 
he had made his son Richard one of the Members of 
the Upper House. He was very kind and 'loving to 
them all, being a good father and a good husband ; 
but he loved this daughter the best of the family, 
and went down to Hampton Court to see her, and 
could hardly be induced to stir from her sick room 
until she died. Although his religion had been of a 
gloomy kind, his disposition had been always cheerful. 
He had been fond of music in his home, and had 
kept open table once a week for all officers of Ihe 
army not below the rank of a captain, and had always 
preserved in his house a quiet, sensible dignity. He 
encouraged men of genius and learning, and loved 
to have them about him. Milton was one of his 
great friends. He was good-humoured too, with 
the nobility, whose dresses and maimers were very

different from his ; and to show them what good infor- 
mation he had, he would sometimes jokingly tell them 
when they were his guests, where they had last 
drank the health of the “ King over the water,” and 
would recommend them to be more private (if they 
could) another time. But he had lived in busy times, 
had borne the weight of heavy State affairs, and had 
often gone in fear of his life. He was ill of the gout 
and ague; and when the death of his beloved child 
came upon him in addition, he sank, never to raise 
his head again. He told his physicians on the twenty- 
fourth of August that the Lord had assured him that 
he was not to die in that illness, and that he would 
certainly get better. This was only his sick fancy, 
for on the third of September, which was the anni- 
versary of the great battle of Worcester, and the day 
of the year which he called his fortunate day, he died, 
in the sixtieth year of his age. He had been delirious, 
and had lain insensible some hours, but he had been 
overheard to murmur a very good prayer the day 
before. The whole country lamented his death. If 
you want to know the real worth of Oliver Cromwell, 
and his real services to his country, you can hardly do 
better than compare England under him, with England 
under Charles the Second.

He had appointed his son Richard to succeed him, 
and after there had been, at Somerset House in the 
Strand, a lying in state more splendid than sensible 
— as all such vanities after death are, I think — Richard 
became Lord Protector. He was an amiable country 
gentleman, but had none of his father’s genius, and 
was quite unfit for such a post in such a storm of 
parties. Richard’s Protectorate, which only lasted a 
year and a half, is a history of quarrels between the 
officers of the army and the Parliament, and between 
the officers among themselves ; and of a growing dis- 
content among the people, who had far too many long 
sermons and far too few amusements, and wanted a 
change. At last, General Monk got the army well 
into his own hands, and then in pursuance of a secret 
plan he seems to have entertained from the time of 
Oliver’s death, declared for the King’s cause. He 
did not do this openly ; but, in his place in the House 
of Commons, as one of the members for Devonshire, 
strongly advocated the proposals of one Sm John 
Greenville, who came to the House with a letter 
from Charies, dated from Breda, and with whom he 
had previously been in secret communication. There 
had been plots and counterplots, and a recal of the 
last members of the Long Parliament, and an end of

the Long Parliament, and risings of the Royalists 
that were made too soon ; and most men being tired 
out, and there being no one to head the country now 
Oliver was dead, it was readily agreed to welcome 
Charles Stuart. Some of the wiser and better members 
said — what was most true — that in the letter from 
Breda, he made no real promise to govern well, and 
that it would be best to make him pledge himself 
beforehand as to what he should be bound to do for 
the benefit of the kingdom. Monk said, however, it 
would be all right when he came, and he could not 
come too soon. 

So, everybody found out all in a moment that the 
country must be prosperous and happy, having another 
Stuart to condescend to reign over it ; and there was 
a prodigious firing off of guns, lighting of bonfires, 
ringing of bells, and throwing up of caps. The people 
drank the King’s health by thousands in the open 
streets, and everybody rejoiced. Down came the Arms 
of the Commonwealth, up went the Royal Arms in- 
stead, and out came the public money. Fifty thousand 
pounds for the King, ten thousand pounds for his 
brother the Duke of York, five thousand pounds for 
his brother the Duke of Gloucester. Prayers for these 
gracious Stuarts were put up in all the churches ;

commissioners were sent to Holland (which suddenly 
found out that Charles was a great man, and that it 
loved him) to invite the King home ; Monk and the 
Kentish grandees went to Dover, to kneel down before 
him as he landed. He kissed and embraced Monk, 
made him ride in the coach with himself and his 
brothers, came on to London amid wonderful shoutings, 
and passed through the army at Blackheath on the 
twenty-ninth of May (his birthday), in the year one 
thousand six hundred and sixty. Greeted by splendid 
dinners under tents, by flags and tapestry streaming 
from all the houses, by delighted crowds in all the 
streets, by troops of noblemen and gentlemen in rich 
dresses, by City companies, trainbands, drummers, 
trumpeters, the great Lord Mayor, and the majestic 
Aldermen, the King went on to "\Vhitehall. On enter- 
ing it, he commemorated his Restoration with the joke 
that it really would seem to have been his own fault 
that he had not come long ago, since everybody told 
him that he had always wished for him with all his 
heart.

CHAPTER XXXY. 

ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE SECOND, CALLED THE 
MERRY MONARCa 

There never were such profligate times in England 
as under Charles the Second. Whenever you see his 
portrait, with his swarthy ill-looking face and great 
nose, you may fancy him in his Court at Whitehall, 
surrounded by some of the very worst vagabonds in 
the kingdom (though they were lords and ladies), 
drinking, gambling, indulging in vicious conversation, 
and committing every kind of profligate excess. It 
has been a fashion to* call Charles the Second “The 
Merry Monarch.” Let me try to give you a general 
idea of some of the merry things that were done, in 
the merry days when this merry gentleman sat upon 
his merry throne, in merry England. 

The first merry proceeding was — of course — to 
declare that he was one of the greatest, the wisest, and 
the noblest kings that ever shone, like the blessed sun 
itself, on this benighted earth. The next merry and 
pleasant piece of business was, for the Parliament, in 
the humblest manner, to give him one million two 
hundred thousand pounds a year, and to settle upon

255 


him for life that old disputed tonnage and poundage 
which had been so bravely fought for. Then, General 
Monk being made Earl of Albemarle, and a few 
other Royalists similarly rewarded, the law went to 
work to see what was to be done to those persons (they 
were called Regicides) who had been concerned in 
making a martyr of the late King. Ten of these were 
merrily executed ; that is to say, six of the judges, one 
of the council, Colonel Hacker and another officer who 
had commanded the Guards, and Hugh Peters, a 
preacher, who had preached against the martyr with 
all his heart. These executions were so extremely 
merry, that every horrible circumstance which Cromwell 
had abandoned was revived with appalling cruelty. 
The hearts of the sufferers were torn out of their 
living bodies; their bowels were burned before their 
faces ; the executioner cut jokes to the next victim, as 
he rubbed his filthy hands together that were reeking 
with the blood of the last ; and the heads of the dead 
were drawn on sledges with the living to the place 
of suffering. Still, even so merry a monarch could 
not force one of these dying men to say that he was 
sorry for what he had done. Nay, the most memorable 
thing said among them was, that if the thing were to 
do again they would do it.

256 A CHILD’S HISTORY OP ENGLAND. 

Sir Harry Vane, who had furnished the evidence 
against Strafford, and was one of the most staunch 
of the Republicans, was also tried, found guilty, and 
ordered for execution. When he came upon the 
scaffold on Tower Hill, after conducting his own 
defence with great power, his notes of what he had 
meant to say to the people were tom away from him, 
and the drums and trumpets were ordered to sound 
lustily and drown his voice ; for, the people had been 
so much impressed by what the Regicides had calmly 
said with their last breath, that it was the custom now, 
to have the drums and trumpets always under the 
scaffold, ready to strike up. Yane said no more than 
this : “ It is a bad cause which cannot bear the words 
of a dying man and bravely died. 

These merry scenes were succeeded by another, 
perhaps even merrier. On the anniversary of the late 
King’s death, the bodies of Oliver Cromwell, Ireton, 
and Bradshaw, were torn out of their graves in West- 
minster Abbey, dragged to Tyburn, hanged there on a 
gallows all day long, and then beheaded. Imagine the 
head of Oliver Cromwell set upon a pole to be stared 
at by a brutal crowd, not one of whom would have 
dared to look the living Oliver in the face for half a 
moment ! Think, after you have read this reign, what

England was under Oliver Cromwell who was tom out 
of his grave, and under this merry monarch who sold 
it, like a merry Judas, over and over again. 

Of course, the remains of Oliver’s wife and daughter 
were not to be spared either, though they had been 
most excellent women. The base clergy of that time 
gaveaip their bodies, which had been buried in the Abbey,, 
and — to the eternal disgrace of England — they were 
thrown into a pit, together with the mouldering bones 
of Pym and of the brave and bold old Admiral Blake. 

The clergy acted this disgraceful part because 
they hoped to get the nonconformists, or dissenters, 
thoroughly put down in this reign, and to have but 
one prayer-book and one service for all kinds of people, 
no matter what their private opinions were. This 
was pretty well, I think, for a Protestant Church, 
which had displaced the Romish Church because 
people had a right to their own opinions in religious 
matters. However, they carried it with a high hand, 
and a prayer-book was agreed upon, in which the 
extremest opinions of Archbishop Laud were not for- 
gotten. An Act was passed, too, preventing any 
dissenter from holding any office under any corporation. 
So, the regular clergy in their triumph were soon as 
merry as the King. The army being by this time

disbanded, and the King crowned, everything was to 
go on easily for ever more. 

I must say a word here about the King's family. 
He had not been long upon the throne when his 
brother the Duke of Gloucester, and his sister the 
Princess of Orange, died within a few months of 
each other, of the small-pox. His remaining sister, 
the Princess Henrietta, married the Duke of 
Orleans, the brother of Louis the Fourteenth, 
King of France. His brother James, Duke of York, 
was made High Admiral, and by and bye became a 
Catholic. He was a gloomy, sullen, bilious sort of 
man, with a remarkable partiality for the ugliest 
women in the country. He married, under very dis- 
creditable circumstances, Anne Hyde, the daughter 
of Lord Clarendon, then the King's principal Minister, 
— not at all a delicate minister either, but doing much 
of the dirty work of a very dirty palace. It became 
important now that the King himself should be 
married ; and divers foreign Monarchs, not very 
particular about the character of their son-in-law, 
proposed their daughters to him. The King of 
Portugal offered his daughter, Catherine of Bra- 
ganza, and fifty thousand pounds : in addition to 
which, the French King, who was favourable to that

match, offered a loan of another fifty thousand. The 
King of Spain, on the other hand, offered any one out 
of a dozen of Princesses, and other hopes of gain. But 
the ready money carried the day, and Catherine came 
over in state to her merry marriage. 

The whole Court was a great flaunting crowd of 
debauched men and shameless women ; and Catherine’s 
merry husband insulted and outraged her in every 
possible way, until she consented to receive those 
worthless creatures as her very good friends, and to 
degrade herself by their companionship. A Mrs. 
Palmer, whom the King made Lady CastlEmaine, 
and afterwards Duchess op Cleveland, was one of 
the most powerful of the bad women about the Court, 
and had great influence with the King nearly all 
through his reign. Another merry lady named Moll 
Davies, a dancer at the theatre, was afterwards her 
rival. So was Nell Gwyn, first an orange girl and 
then an actress, who really had some good in her, 
and of whom one of the worst things I know is, 
that she actually does seem to have been fond of 
the King. The first Duke op St. Albans was this 
orange girl’s child. In like manner the son of a 
merry waiting-lady, whom the King created Duchess 
op Portsmouth, became the Duke of Richmond.

Upon the whole it is not so bad a thing to be a 
commoner. 

The Merry' Monarch was so exceedingly merry 
among these merry ladies, and some equally merry 
(and equally infamous) lords and gentlemen, that he 
soon got through his hundred thousand pounds, and 
then, by way of raising a little pocket-money, made 
a merry bargain. He sold Dunkirk to the French 
King for five millions of livres. When I think of the 
dignity to which Oliver Cromwell raised England 
in the eyes of foreign powers, and when I think of the 
manner in which he gained for England this very 
Dunkirk, I am much inclined to consider that if the 
Merry Monarch had been made to follow his father 
for this action, he would have received his just deserts. 

Though he was like his father in none of that father’s 
greater qualities, he was undoubtedly like him in being 
worthy of no trust. When he sent that letter to the 
Parliament, from Breda, he did expressly promise that 
all sincere religious opinions should be respected. Yet 
he was no sooner firm in his power than he consented 
to one of the worst Acts of Parliament ever passed. 
Under this law, every minister who should not give 
his solemn assent to the Prayer-Book by a certain day 
was declared to be a minister no longer, and to be

deprived of his church. The consequence of this was 
that some two thousand honest men were taken from 
their congregations, and reduced to dire poverty and 
distress. It was followed by another outrageous law, 
called the Conventicle Act, by which any person above 
the age of sixteen who was present at any religious 
service not according to the Prayer-Book, was to be 
imprisoned three months for the first offence, and six 
for the second, and to be transported for the third. 
This Act alone filled the prisons, which were then 
most villanous dungeons, to overflowing. 

The Covenanters in Scotland had already fared no 
better. A base Parliament, usually known as the 
Drunken Parliament in consequence of its principal 
members being seldom sober, had been got together to 
make laws against the Covenanters, and to force all 
men to be of one mind in religious matters. The 
Marquis of Argyle, relying on the King’s honour, 
had given himself up to him ; but, he was wealthy, and 
his enemies wanted his wealth. He was tried for 
treason on the evidence of some private letters, in which 
he had expressed opinions — as well he might — more 
favourable to the government of the late Lord Protector 
than of the present merry and religious King. He 
was executed, as were two men of mark among the

Covenanters ; and Sharp, a traitor who had once been 
the friend of the Presbyterians and betrayed them, 
was made Archbishop of St. Andrew's, to teach the 
Scotch how to like bishops. 

Things being in this merry state at home, the Merry 
Monarch undertook a war with the Dutch ; principally 
because they interfered with an African company, 
established with the two objects of buying gold-dust 
and slaves, of which the Duke of York was a leading 
member. After some preliminary hostilities, the said 
Duke sailed to the coast of Holland with a fleet of 
ninety-eight vessels of war, and four fire-ships. This 
engaged with the Dutch fleet, of no fewer than one 
hundred and thirteen ships. In the great battle 
between the two forces, the Dutch lost eighteen ships, 
four admirals, and seven thousand men. But, the 
English on shore were in no mood of exultation when 
they heard the news. 

For, this was the year and the time of the Great 
Plague in London. During the winter of one thousand 
six hundred and sixty-four it had been whispered about, 
that some few people had died here and there of the 
disease called the Plague, in some of the unwholesome 
suburbs around London. News was not published at 
that time as it is now, and some people believed these

rumours, and some disbelieved them, and they were 
soon forgotten. . But, in the month of May, one thou- 
sand six hundred and sixty-five, it began to be said all 
over the town that the disease had burst out with great 
violence in St. Giles’s, and that the people were dying 
in great numbers. This soon turned out to be awfully 
true. The roads out of London were choked up by 
people endeavouring to escape from the infected city, 
and large sums were paid for any kind of conveyance. 
The disease soon spread so fast, that it was necessary 
to shut up the houses in which sick people were, and 
to cut them off from communication with the living. 
Every one of these houses was marked on the outside 
of the door with a red cross, and the words, Lord, 
have mercy upon us ! The streets were all deserted, 
grass grew in the public ways, and there was a dreadful 
silence in the air. When night came on, dismal 
rumblings used to be heard, and these were the wheels 
of the death-carts, attended by men with veiled faces 
and holding cloths to their mouths, who rang doleful 
bells and cried in a loud and solemn voice, “ Bring out 
your dead !” The .corpses put into these carts were 
buried by torchlight in great pits ; no service being 
performed over them ; all men being afraid to stay for 
a moment on the brink of the ghastly graves. In the

general fear, children ran away from their parents, and 
parents from their children. Some who were taken ill, 
died alone, and without any help. Some were stabbed 
or strangled by hired nurses, who robbed them of all 
their money and stole the very beds on which they lay. 
Some went mad, dropped from the windows, ran 
through the streets, and in their pain and frenzy flung 
themselves into the river. 

These were not all the horrors of the time. The 
wicked and dissolute, in wild desperation, sat in the 
taverns singing roaring songs, and were stricken as 
they drank, and went out and died. The fearful and 
superstitious persuaded themselves that they saw 
supernatural sights — burning swords in the sky, 
gigantic arms and darts. Others pretended that at 
nights vast crowds of ghosts walked round and round 
the dismal pits. One madman, naked, and carrying a 
brazier full of burning coals upon his head, stalked 
through the streets, crying out that he was a Prophet, 
commissioned to denounce the vengeance of the Lord 
on wicked London. Another always went to and fro, 
exclaiming, “Yet forty days, and London shall be 
destroyed!” A third awoke the echoes in the 
dismal streets, by night and by day, and made the 
blood of the sick run cold, by calling out incessantly,

in a deep, hoarse voice, 0, the great and dreadful 
God!” 

Through the months of July and August and Sep- 
tember, the Great Plague raged more and more. 
Great fires were lighted in the streets, in the hope of 
stopping the infection ; but there was a plague of rain 
too, and it beat the fires out. At last, the winds which 
usually arise at that time of the year which is called 
the equinox, when day and night are of equal length 
all over the world, began to blow, and to purify the 
wretched town. The deaths began to decrease, the 
red crosses slowly to disappear, the fugitives to return, 
the shops to open again, pale frightened faces to be 
seen in the streets. The Plague had been in every 
part of England, but in close and unwholesome London 
it had killed one hundred thousand people. 

All this time, the Merry Monarch was as merry as 
ever, and as worthless $is ever. All this time, the 
debauched lords and gentlemen and the shameless 
ladies danced and gamed and drank, and loved and 
hated one another, according to their merry ways. So 
little humanity did the government learn from the late 
affliction, that one of the first things the Parliament 
did when it met at Oxford (being as yet afraid to come 
to London), was to make a law, called the Five Mile

Act, expressly directed against those poor ministers 
who, in the time of the Plague, had manfully come 
back to comfort the unhappy people. This infamous 
law, by forbidding them to teach in any school, or to 
come within five miles of any city, town, or village, 
doomed them to starvation and death. 

The fleet had been at sea, and healthy. The King 
of France was now in alliance with the Dutch, though 
his navy was chiefly employed in looking on while the 
English and Dutch fought. The Dutch gained one 
victory; and the English gained another and a greater; 
and Prince Rupert, one of the English admirals, was 
out in the Channel one windy night, looking out for 
the French Admiral, with the intention of giving him 
something more to do than he had had yet, when the 
gale increased to a storm, and bLw him into Saint 
Helen’s. That night was the third of September, one 
thousand six hundred and sixty-six, and that wind 
fanned the Great Fire of London. 

It broke out at a baker’s shop near London Bridge, 
on the spot on which the Monument now stands as a 
remembrance of those raging flames. It spread and 
spread, and burned and burned, for three days. The 
nights were lighter than the days ; in the day-time there 
was an immense cloud of smoke, and in the night-time

there was a great tower of fire mounting up into the 
sky, which lighted the whole country landscape for ten 
miles round. Showers of hot ashes rose into the air 
and fell on distant places; flying sparks carried the 
conflagration to great distances, and kindled it in 
twenty new spots at a time ; church steeples fell down 
with tremendous crashes ; houses crumbled into cinders 
by the hundred and the thousand. The summer had 
been intensely hot and dry, the streets were very 
narrow, and the houses mostly built of wood and 
plaster. Nothing could stop the tremendous fire, but 
the want of more houses to bum; nor did it stop 
until the whole way from the Tower to Temple Bar 
was a desert, composed of the ashes of thirteen 
thousand houses and eighty-nine churches. 

This was a terrible visitation at the time, and 
occasioned great loss and suffering to the two hundred 
thousand burat-out people, who were obliged to lie in 
the fields under the open night sky, or in hastily-made 
huts of mud and straw, while the lanes and roads were 
rendered impassable by carts which had broken down 
as they tried to save their goods. But the Fire was a 
great blessing to the City afterwards, for it arose from 
its ruins very much improved — built more regularly, 
more widely, more cleanly and carefully, and therefore

much more healthily. It might be far more healthy 
than it is, but there are some people in it still — even 
now, at this time, nearly two hundred years later — so 
selfish, so pig-headed, and so ignorant, that I doubt if 
even another Great Fire would warm them up to do 
their duty. 

The Catholics were accused of having wilfully set 
London in flames ; one poor Frenchman, who had been 
mad for years, even accused himself of having with his 
own hand fired the first house. There is no reason- 
able doubt, however, that the fire was accidental. An 
inscription on the Monument long attributed it to the 
Catholics; but it is removed now, and was always a 
malicious and stupid untruth. 


Second Part. 

That the Merry Monarch might be very merry 
indeed, in the merry times when his people were suffer- 
ing under pestilence and fire, he drank and gambled 
and flung away among his favourites the money which 
the Parliament had voted for the war. The consequence 
of this was that the stout-hearted English sailors were 
merrily starving of want, and dying in the streets ; while

the Dutch, under their admirals De Witt and De 
Rotter, came into the River Thames, and even up 
the River Medway as far as Upnor, burned the guard- 
ships, silenced the weak batteries, and did what they 
would to the English coast for six whole weeks. Most 
of the English ships that could have prevented them 
had neither powder nor shot on board ; in this merry 
reign, public officers made themselves as merry as the 
Kin g did with the public money; and when it was 
entrusted to them to spend in national defences or 
preparations, they put it into their own pockets with 
the merriest grace in the world. 

Lord Clarendon had, by this time, run as long a 
course as is usually allotted to the unscrupulous 
ministers of bad kings. He was impeached by his 
political opponents, but unsuccessfully. The Kin g 
then commanded him to withdraw from England and 
retire to France, which he did, after defending himself 
in writing. He was no great loss at home, and died 
abroad some seven years afterwards. 

There then came into power a ministry called 
the Cabal Ministry, because it was composed of 
Lord Clifford, the Earl of Arlington, the 
Duke of Buckingham (a great rascal, and the King’s 
most powerful favorite), Lord Ashley, and the

270 A CHILES HISTORY OP ENGLAND. 

Duke of Lauderdale, c. a. b. a. l. As the French 
were making conquests in Flanders, the first Cabal 
proceeding was to make a treaty with the Dutch, 
for uniting with Spain to oppose the French. It was 
no sooner made than the Merry Monarch, who always 
wanted to get money without being accountable to a 
Parliament for his expenditure, apologised to the King 
of France for having had anything to do with it, and 
concluded a secret treaty with him, making himself his 
infamous pensioner to the amount of two millions of 
livres down, and three millions more a year; and 
engaging to desert that very Spain, to make war 
against those very Dutch, and to declare himself a 
Catholic when a convenient time should arrive. This 
religious king had lately been crying to his Catholic 
brother on the subject of his strong desire to be a 
Catholic ; and now he merrily concluded this treason- 
able conspiracy against the country he governed, by 
undertaking to become one as soon as he safely could. 
For all of which, though he had had ten merry heads 
instead of one, he richly deserved to lose them by the 
headsman's axe. 

As his one merry head might, have been far from 
safe, if these things had been known, they were kept 
very quiet, and war was declared by France and

England against the Dutch. But, a very uncommon 
man, afterwards most important to English history 
and to the religion and liberty of this land, arose 
among them, and for many long years defeated the 
whole projects of France. This was William op 
Nassau, Prince of Orange, son of the last Prince of 
Orange of the same name, who married the daughter 
of Charles the First of England. He was a young 
man at this time, only just of age ; but he was brave, 
cool, intrepid, and wise. His father had been so 
detested that, upon his death, the Dutch had 
abolished the authority to which this son would have 
otherwise succeeded (Stadtholder it was called), and 
placed the chief power in the hands of John de 
Witt, who educated this young prince. Now, the 
Prince became very popular, and John de Witt's 
brother Cornelius was sentenced to banishment on 
a false accusation of conspiring to kill him. John 
went to the prison where he was, to take him away 
to exile, in his coach ; and a great mob who collected 
on the occasion, then and there cruelly murdered both 
the brothers. This left the government in the hands 
of the Prince, who was really the choice of the nation ; 
and from this time he exercised it with the greatest 
vigour, against the whole power of France, under its

famous generals Cond£ and Turenne, and in support 
of the Protestant religion. It was full seven years 
before this war ended in a treaty of peace made at 
Nimeguen, and its details would occupy a very con- 
siderable space. It is enough to say that William of 
Orange established a famous character with the whole 
world ; and that the Merry Monarch, adding to and 
improving on his former baseness, bound himself to 
do everything the King of France liked, and nothing 
the King of France did not like, for a pension of one 
hundred thousand pounds a year, which was after- 
wards doubled. Besides this, the King of France, by 
means of his corrupt ambassador — who wrote accounts 
of his proceedings in England, which are not always 
to be believed, I think — bought our English members 
of Parliament as he wanted them. So, in point of 
fact, during a considerable portion of this merry reign, 
the King of France was the real King of this country. 

But there was a better time to come, and it was to 
come (though his royal uncle little thought so) through 
that very William, Prince of Orange. He came over to 
England, saw Mary, the elder daughter of the Duke of 
York, and married her. We shall see by and bye what 
came of that marriage, and why it is never to be forgotten. 

This daughter was a Protestant, but her mother

died a Catholic. She and her sister Anne, also a 
Protestant, were the only survivors of eight children; 
Anne afterwards married George, Prince of Den- 
mark, brother to the King of that country. 

Lest you should do the Merry Monarch the injustice of 
supposing that he was even good-humored (except when 
he had everything his own way), or that he was high- 
spirited and honourable, I will mention here what was 
done to a member of the House of Commons, Sir John 
Coventry. He made a remark in a debate about 
taxing the theatres, which gave the King offence. He 
agreed with his illegitimate son, who had been bom 
abroad, and whom he had made Duke of Monmouth, 
to take the following merry vengeance. To waylay him 
at night, fifteen armed men to one, and to slit his nose 
with a penknife. Like master, like man. The King's 
favorite, the Duke of Buckingham, was strongly sus- 
pected of setting on an assassin to murder the Duke 
of Ormond as he was returning home from a dinner ; 
and that Duke’s spirited son, Lord Ossory, was so 
persuaded of his guilt, that he said to him at Court, 
even as he stood beside the King, “ My lord, I know 
very well that you are at the bottom of this late attempt 
upon my father. But I give you warning, if he ever 

come to a violent end, his blood shall be upon you, 
vol. m. t

and wherever I meet you I will pistol you! I 
will do so, though I find you standing behind the 
King’s chair; and I tell you this in his Majesty’s 
presence, that you may be quite sure of my 
doing what I threaten.” Those were merry times 
indeed. 

■ There was a fellow named Blood, who was seized 
for making, with two companions, an audacious attempt 
to steal the crown, the globe, and sceptre from the 
place where the jewels were kept, in the Tower. This 
robber, who was a swaggering ruffian, being taken, 
declared that he was the man who had endeavoured 
to kill the Duke of Ormond, and that he had meant 
,to kill the King too, but was overawed by the majesty 
of his appearance, when he might otherwise have done 
it, as he was bathing at Battersea. The King being 
but an ill-looking fellow, I don’t believe a word of this. 
Whether he was flattered, or whether he knew that 
Buckingham had really set Blood on to murder the 
Duke, is uncertain. But it is quite certain that he 
pardoned this thief, gave him an estate of five hundred 
a year in Ireland (which had had the honour of giving 
him birth), and presented him at Court to the 
debauched lords and the shameless ladies, who made a 
great deal of him — as I have no doubt they would

have made of the devil himself, if the King had 
introduced him. 

Infamously pensioned as he was, the King still 
wanted money, and consequently was obliged to call 
Parliaments. In these, the great object of the Protes- 
tants was to thwart the Catholic Duke of York, who 
married a second time ; his new wife being a young 
lady only fifteen years old, the Catholic sister of the 
Duke of Modena. In this they were seconded 
by the Protestant Dissenters, though to their 
own disadvantage, since, to exclude Catholics from 
power, they were even willing to exclude themselves. 
The King’s object was to pretend to be a Protestant, 
while he was really a Catholic ; to swear to the bishops 
that he was devoutly attached to the English Church, 
while he knew he had bargained it away to the 
King of France ; and by cheating and deceiving them, 
and all who were attached to royalty, to become 
despotic and be powerful enough to confess what a 
rascal he was. Meantime, the King of France, know- 
ing his merry pensioner well, intrigued with the King’s 
opponents in Parliament, as well as with the King and 
his friends. 

The fears that the country had of the Catholic 

religion being restored, if the Duke of York should

come to the throne, and the low cunning of the King 
in pretending to share their alarms, led to some very 
terrible results. A certain Dr. Tonge, a dull clergy- 
man in the city, fell into the hands of a certain Titus 
Oates, a most infamous character, who pretended to 
have acquired among the Jesuits abroad a knowledge 
of a great plot for the murder of the King, and the 
re-establishment of the Catholic religion. Titus Oates, 
being produced by this unlucky Dr. Tonge and 
solemnly examined before the council, contradicted 
himself in a thousand ways, told the most ridiculous 
and improbable stories, and implicated Coleman, the 
Secretary of the Duchess of York. Now, although 
what he charged against Coleman was not true, and 
although you and I know very well that the real 
dangerous Catholic plot was that one with the King 
of France of which the Merry Monarch was himself 
the head, there happened to be found among Coleman’s 
papers, some letters, in which he did praise the days 
of Bloody Queen Mary, and abuse the Protestant 
religion. This was great good fortune for Titus, as 
it seemed to confirm him ; but better still was in store. 
Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, the magistrate who had 
first examined him, being unexpectedly found dead 
near Primrose Hill, was confidently believed to have

been killed by the Catholics. I think there is no 
doubt that he had been melancholy mad, and that 
he killed himself; but he had a great Protestant 
funeral, and Titus was called the Saver of the Nation, 
and received a pension of twelve hundred pounds a 
year. 

As soon as Oates’s wickedness had met with this 
success, up started another villain, named William 
Bedloe, who, attracted by a reward of five hundred 
pounds offered for the apprehension of the murderers 
of Godfrey, came forward and charged two Jesuits and 
some other persons with having committed it at the 
Queen’s desire. Oates, going into partnership with 
this new informer, had the audacity to accuse the poor 
Queen herself of high treason. Then appeared a third 
informer, as bad as either of the two, and accused a 
Catholic banker named Stayley of having said that 
the Kin g was the greatest rogue in the world (which 
would not have been far from the truth), and that he 
would kill him with his own hand. This banker, being 
at once tried and executed, Coleman and two others 
were tried and executed. Then, a miserable wretch 
named Prance, a Catholic silversmith, being accused 
by Bedloe, was tortured into confessing that he had 
taken part in Godfrey’s murder, and into accusing

278 A child’s HISTOBY OF ENGLAND. 

three other men of having committed it. Then, five 
Jesuits were accused by Oates, Bedloe, and Prance 
together, and were all found guilty, and executed on 
the same kind of contradictory and absurd evidence. 
The Queen’s physician and three monks were next put 
on their trial; but Oates and Bedloe had for the time 
gone far enough, and these four were acquitted. The 
public mind, however, was so full of a Catholic plot, 
and so strong against the Duke of York, that James 
consented to obey a written order from his brother, 
and to go with his family to Brussels, provided that 
his rights should never be sacrificed in his absence to 
the Duke of Monmouth. The House of Commons, 
not satisfied with this as the King hoped, passed a 
bill to exclude the Duke from ever succeeding to the 
throne. In return, the King dissolved the Parliament. 
He had deserted his old favourite, the Duke of 
Buckingham, who was now in the opposition. 

To give any sufficient idea of the miseries of 
Scotland in this merry reign, would occupy a hundred 
pages. Because the people would not have bishops, 
and were resolved to stand by their solemn League 
and Covenant, such cruelties were inflicted upon them 
as make the blood run cold. Ferocious dragoons 
galloped through the country to punish the peasants

for deserting the churches; sons were hanged up at 
their fathers’ doors for refusing to disclose where their 
fathers were concealed ; wives were tortured to death 
for not betraying their husbands; people were taken 
out of their fields and gardens, and shot on the public 
roads without trial ; lighted matches were tied to the 
fingers of prisoners, and a most horrible torment called 
the Boot was invented, and constantly applied, which 
ground and mashed the victims’ legs with iron wedges. 
Witnesses were tortured as well as prisoners. All the 
prisons were full; all the gibbets were heavy with 
bodies; murder and plunder devastated the Whole 
country. In spite of all, the Covenanters were by no 
means to be dragged into the churches, and persisted 
in worshipping God as they thought right. A body of 
ferocious Highlanders, turned upon them from the 
mountains of their own country, had no greater effect 
than the English dragoons under Grahame of 
Claverhouse, the most cruel and rapacious of all 
their enemies, whose name will ever be cursed through 
the length and breadth of Scotland. Archbishop 
Sharp had ever aided and abetted all these outrages. 
But he fell at last; for, when the injuries of the 
Scottish people were at their height, he was seen, in 
his coach-and-six coming across a moor, by a body

of men, headed by one John Balfour, who were 
waiting for another of their oppressors. Upon this 
they cried out that Heaven had delivered him into 
their hands, and killed him with many wounds. If 
ever a man deserved such a death, I think Archbishop 
Sharp did. 

It made a great noise directly, and the Merry 
Monarch — strongly suspected of having goaded the 
Scottish people on, that he might have an excuse for 
a greater army than the Parliament were willing to 
give him — sent down his son, the Duke of Monmouth, 
as commander-in-chief, with instructions to attack the 
Scottish rebels, or Whigs as they were called, when- 
ever he came up with them. Marching with ten 
thousand men from Edinburgh, he found them, in 
number four or five thousand, drawn up at Bothwell 
Bridge, by the Clyde. They were soon dispersed ; and 
Monmouth showed a more humane character towards 
them, than he had shown towards that Member of 
Parliament whose nose he had caused to be slit with 
a pen-knife. But the Duke of Lauderdale was their 
bitter foe, and sent Claverhouse to finish them. 

As the Duke of York became more and more un- 
popular, the Duke of Monmouth became more and 
more popular. It would have been decent in the

latter not to have voted in favour of the renewed bill 
for the exclusion of James from the throne; but he 
did so, much to the King’s amusement, who used to 
sit in the, House of Lords by the fire, hearing the 
debates, which he said were as good as a play. The 
House of Commons passed the bill by a large 
majority, and it was carried up to the House of Lords 
by Lord Russell, one of the best of the leaders on 
the Protestant side. It was rejected there, chiefly 
because the bishops helped the King to get rid of it ; 
and the fear of Catholic plots revived again. There 
had been another got up, by a fellow out of Newgate, 
named Dangerfield, which is more famous than it 
deserves to be, under the name of the Meal-Tub 
Plot. This jail-bird having been got out of Newgate 
by a Mrs. Cellier, a Catholic nurse, had turned 
Catholic himself, and pretended that he knew of a 
plot among the Presbyterians against the King’s life. 
This was very pleasant to the Duke of York, who 
hated the Presbyterians, who returned the compliment. 
He gave Dangerfield twenty guineas, and sent him to 
the King his brother. But Dangerfield, breaking 
down altogether in his charge, and being sent back to 
Newgate, almost astonished the Duke out of his five 
senses by suddenly swearing that the Catholic nurse

had put that false design into his head, and that what 
he really knew about, was, a Catholic plot against the 
King ; the evidence of which would be found in some 
papers, concealed in a meal-tub in Mrs. Cellier’s house. 
There they were, of course ; for he had put them there 
himself; and so the tub gave the name to the plot. 
But, the nurse was acquitted on her trial, and it came 
to nothing. 

Lord Ashley, of the Cabal, was now Lord Shaftes- 
bury, and was strong against the succession of the 
Duke of York. The House of Commons, aggravated 
to the utmost extent, as we may well suppose, by sus- 
picions of the King’s conspiracy with, the King of 
France, made a desperate point of the exclusion still, 
and were bitter against the Catholics generally. So 
unjustly bitter were they, I grieve to say, that they 
impeached the venerable Lord Stafford, a Catholic 
nobleman seventy years old, of a design to kill the 
King. The witnesses were that atrocious Oates and 
two other birds of the same feather. He was found 
guilty, on evidence quite as foolish as it was false, and 
was beheaded on Tower Hill. The people were 
opposed to him when he first appeared upon the scaf- 
fold ; but, when he had addressed them and shown 
them how innocent he was, and how wickedly he was

sent there, their better nature was aroused, and they 
said, “We believe you, my Lord. God bless you, 
my Lord ! ” 

The House of Commons refused to let the King have 
any money until he should consent to the Exclusion 
Bill ; but, as he could get it and did get it from his 
master the King of France, he could afford to hold 
them very cheap. He called a Parliament at Oxford, 
to which he went down with a great show of being 
armed and protected as if he were in danger of his life, 
and to which the opposition members also went armed 
and protected, alleging that they were in fear of the 
Papists, who were numerous among the King’s guards. 
However, they went on with the Exclusion Bill, and 
were so earnest upon it that they would have carried 
it again, if the King had not popped his crown and 
state robes into a sedan chair, bundled himself into it 
along with them, hurried down to the chamber where 
the House of Lords met, and dissolved the Parliament. 
After which he scampered home, and the Members of 
Parliament scampered home too, as fast as their legs 
could carry them. 

The Duke of York, then residing in Scotland, had, 
under the law which excluded Catholics from publi6 
trust, no right whatever to public employment. Never-

theless, he was openly employed as the King's repre- 
sentative in Scotland, and there gratified his sullen and 
cruel nature to his heart’s content by directing the 
dreadful cruelties against the Covenanters. There 
were two ministers named Cargill and Cameron who 
had escaped from the battle of Bothwell Bridge, and 
who returned to Scotland, and raised the miserable but 
still brave and unsubdued Covenanters afresh, under 
the name of Cameronians. As Cameron publicly 
posted a declaration that the King was a forsworn 
tyrant, no mercy was shown to his unhappy followers 
after he was slain in battle. The Duke of York, who 
was particularly fond of the Boot and derived great 
pleasure from having it applied, offered their lives to 
some of these people, if they would cry on the scaffold 
“God save the King!” But their relations, friends, 
and countrymen, had been so barbarously tortured and 
murdered in this merry reign, that they preferred to 
die, and did die. The Duke then obtained his merry 
brother’s permission to hold a Parliament in Scotland, 
which first, with most shameless deceit, confirmed the 
laws for securing the Protestant religion against Popery, 
and then declared that nothing must or should prevent 
the succession of the Popish Duke. After this double- 
faced beginning, it established an oath which no human

being could understand, but which everybody was to 
take, as a proof that his religion was the lawful religion. 
The Earl of Argyle, taking it with the explanation that 
he did not consider it to prevent him from favouring 
any alteration either in the Church or State which, 
was not inconsistent with the Protestant religion or 
with his loyalty, was tried for high treason before a 
Scottish jury of which the Marquis of Montrose was 
foreman, and was found guilty. He escaped the scaf- 
fold, for that time, by getting away, in the disguise of 
a page, in the train of his daughter, Lady Sophia 
Lindsay. It was absolutely proposed, by certain 
members of the Scottish Council, that this lady should 
be whipped through the streets of Edinburgh. But 
this was too much even for the Duke, who had the 
manliness then (he had very little at most times) to 
remark that Englishmen were not accustomed to treat 
ladies in that manner. In those merry times nothing 
could equal the brutal servility of the Scottish fawners, 
but the conduct of similar degraded beings in England. 

After the settlement of these little affairs, the Duke 
returned to England, and soon resumed his place at 
the Council, and his office of High Admiral — all this 
by his brother’s favour, and in open defiance of the 
law. It would have been no loss to the country, if he

had been drowned when his ship, in going to Scotland 
to fetch his family, struck on a sand-bank, and was 
lost with two hundred souls on board. But he escaped 
in a boat with some friends ; and the sailors were so 
brave and unselfish, that, when they saw him rowing 
away, they gave three cheers, while they themselves 
were going down for ever. 

The Merry Monarch, having got rid of his Parlia- 
ment, went to work to make himself despotic with 
all speed. Having had the villainy to order the 
execution of Oliver Plunket, Bishop of Armagh, 
falsely accused of a plot to establish Popery in that 
country by means of a French army — the very thing 
this royal traitor was himself trying to do at home — 
and having tried to ruin Lord Shaftesbury, and failed 
— he turned his hand to controlling the corporations 
all over the country ; because, if he could only do 
that, he could get what juries he chose, to bring in 
perjured verdicts, and could get what members he 
chose, returned to Parliament. These merry times 
produced, and made Chief Justice of the Court of 
King’s Bench, a drunken ruffian of the name of 
Jeffreys ; a red-faced, swollen, bloated, horrible 
creature, with a bullying roaring voice, and a more 
savage nature perhaps than was ever lodged in

any human breast. This monster was the Merry 
Monarch’s especial favorite, and he testified his admi- 
ration of him by giving him a ring from his own 
finger, which the people used to call Judge Jeffreys’ 
Bloodstone. Him the King employed to go about 
and bully the corporations, beginning with London ; 
or, as Jeffreys himself elegantly called it, “to give 
them a lick with the rough side of his tongue.” And 
he did it so thoroughly, that they soon became the 
basest and most sycophantic bodies in the kingdom — 
except the University of Oxford, which, in that 
respect, was quite pre-eminent and unapproachable. 

Lord Shaftesbury (who died soon after the King’s 
failure against him), Lord William Bussell, the 
Duke of Monmouth, Lord Howard, Lord Jersey, 
Algernon Sidney, John Hampden (grandson of the 
great Hampden), and some others, used to hold a 
council together after the dissolution of the Parliament, 
arranging what it might be necessary to do, if the 
King carried his Popish plot to the utmost height. 
Lord Shaftesbury having been much the most violent 
of this party, brought two violent men into their 
secrets — Rumsey, who had been a soldier in the 
Republican army; and West, a lawyer. These two 
knew an old officer of Cromwell's, called Rumbold,

who had married a maltster’s widow, and so had come 
into possession of a solitary dwelling called the Rye 
House, near Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire. Rumbold 
said to them what a capital place this house of his 
would be from which to shoot at the King, who often 
passed there going to and fro from Newmarket. 
They liked the idea, and entertained it. But, one of 
their body gave information ; and they, together with 
Shepherd a wine merchant, Lord Russell, Algernon 
Sidney, Lord Essex, Lord Howard, and Hampden, 
were all arrested. 

Lord Russell might have easily escaped, but scorned 
to do so, being innocent of any wrong ; Lord Essex 
might have easily escaped, but scorned to do so, lest 
his flight should prejudice Lord Russell. But it 
weighed upon his mind that he had brought into their 
council Lord Howard — who now turned a miserable 
traitor — against a great dislike Lord Russell had 
always had of him. He could not bear the reflection, 
and destroyed himself before Lord Russell was brought 
to trial at the Old Bailey. 

He knew very well that he had nothing to hope, 
having always been manful in the Protestant cause 
against the two false brothers, the one on the throne, 
and the other standing next to it. He had a wife.

one of the noblest and best of women, who acted as 
his secretary on his trial, who comforted him in his 
prison, who supped with him on the night before he 
died, and whose love and virtue and devotion have 
made her name imperishable. Of course, he was found 
guilty, and was sentenced to be beheaded in Lincoln’s 
Inn Fields, not many yards from his own house. 
When he had parted from his children on the evening 
before his death, his wife still stayed with him until 
ten o’clock at night ; and when their final separation 
in this world was over, and he had kissed her many 
times, he still sat for a long while in his prison, 
talking of her goodness. Hearing the rain fall fast 
at that time, he calmly said, “ Such a rain to-morrow 
will spoil a great show, which is a dull thing on a 
rainy day.” At midnight he went to bed, and 
slept till four ; even when his servant called him, he 
fell asleep again while his clothes were being made 
ready. He rode to the scaffold in his own car- 
riage, attended by two famous clergymen, Tillotson 
and Burnet, and sang a psalm to himself very softly, 
as he went along. He was as quiet and as steady, as 
if he had been going out for an ordinary ride. After 
saying that he was surprised to see so great a crowd, 

he laid down his head upon the block, as if upon

the pillow of his bed, and had it struck off at the 
second blow. His noble wife was busy for him 
eyen then; for that true-hearted lady printed and 
widely circulated his last words, of which he had given 
her a copy. They made the blood of all the honest 
men in England boil. 

The University of Oxford distinguished itself on 
the very same day by pretending to believe that the 
accusation against Lord Russell was true, and by 
calling the King, in a written paper, the Breath of 
their Nostrils and the Anointed of the Lord. This 
paper the Parliament afterwards caused to be burned 
by the common hangman, which I am sorry for, as 
I wish it had been framed and glazed and hung up in 
some public place, as a monument of baseness for the 
scorn of mankind. 

Next came the trial of Algernon Sidney, at which 
Jeffreys presided, like a great crimson toad, sweltering 
and swelling with rage. “ I pray God, Mr. Sidney,” 
said this Chief Justice of a merry reign, after passing 
sentence, “ to work in you a temper fit to go to the 
other world, for I see you are not fit for this.” “ My 
lord,” said the prisoner, composedly holding out his 
arm, “ feel my pulse* and see if I be disordered. I 
thank Heaven I never was in better temper than I am

now.” Algernon Sidney was executed on Tower Hill, 
on the seventh of December, one thousand six hundred 
and eighty-three. He died a hero, and died, in his 
own words, “ For that good old cause in which he had 
been engaged from his youth, and for which God had 
so often and so wonderfully declared himself.” 

The Duke of Monmouth had been making his uncle, 
the Duke of York, very jealous, by going about the 
country in a royal sort of way, playing at the people’s 
games, becoming godfather to their children, and even 
touching for the King’s evil, or stroking the faces of 
the sick to cure them — though, for the matter of that, 
I should say he did them about as much good as any 
crowned king could have done. His father had got 
him to write a letter, confessing his having had a part 
in the conspiracy, for which Lord Russell had been 
beheaded ; but he was ever a weak man, and as soon 
as he had written it, he was ashamed of it, and got it 
back again. For this, he was banished to the Nether- 
lands ; but he soon returned and had an interview 
with his father, unknown to his uncle. It would seem 
that he was coming into the Merry Monarch’s favor 
again, and that the Duke of York was sliding out 
of it, when Death appeared to the merry galleries 
at Whitehall, and astonished the debauched lords

and gentlemen, and the shameless ladies, very con- 
siderably. 

On Monday, the second of February, one thousand 
six hundred and eighty-five, the merry pensioner and 
servant of the King of France fell down in a fit of 
apoplexy. By the Wednesday his case was hopeless, 
and on the Thursday he was told so. As he made 
a difficulty about taking the sacrament from the 
Protestant Bishop of Bath, the Duke of York got 
all who were present away from the bed, and asked his 
brother, in a whisper, if he should send for a Catholic 
priest. The King replied, “ For God’s sake, brother, 
do.” The Duke smuggled in, up the back stairs, 
disguised in a wig and gown, a priest named Huddle- 
ston, who had saved the King’s life after the battle 
of Worcester : telling him that this worthy man in 
the wig had once saved his body, and was now come 
to save his soul. 

The Merry Monarch lived through that night, and 
died before noon on the next day, which was Friday, 
the sixth. Two of the last things he said were of a 
human sort, and your remembrance will give him the 
full benefit of them. When the Queen sent to say she 
was too unwell to attend him and to ask his pardon, 
he said, “ Alas ! poor woman, she beg my pardon !

I beg hers with all my heart. Take back that answer 
to her.” And he also said, in reference to Nell Gwyn, 
“ Do not let poor Nelly starve.” 

He died in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and the 
twenty-fifth of his reign. 


CHAPTER XXXVI. 

ENGLAND UNDER JAMES THE SECOND. 

King James the Second was a man so very dis- 
agreeable, that even the best of historians has favored 
his brother Charles, as becoming, by comparison, 
quite a pleasant character. The one object of his 
short reign was to re-establish the Catholic religion 
in England ; and this he doggedly pursued with 
such a stupid obstinacy, that his career very soon came 
to a close. 

The first thing he did, was, to assure his council 
that he would make it his endeavor to preserve the 
Government, both in Church and State, as it was by 
law established ; and that he would always take care 
to defend and support the Church. Great public 
acclamations were raised over this fair speech, and

a great deal was said, from the pulpits and elsewhere, 
about the word of a King which was never broken, 
by credulous people who little supposed that he had 
formed a secret council for Catholic affairs, of which 
a mischievous Jesuit, called Father Petre, was one 
of the chief members. With tears of joy in his eyes, 
he received, as the beginning of his pension from the 
King of France, five hundred thousand livres; yet, 
with a mixture of meanness and arrogance that be- 
longed to his contemptible character, he was always 
jealous of making some show of being independent 
of the King of France, while he pocketed his money. 
As — notwithstanding his publishing two papers in 
favor of Popery (and not likely to do it much service, 

I should think) written by the King, his brother, and 
found in his strong box ; and his open display of 
himself attending mass — the Parliament was very obse- 
quious, and granted him a large sum of money, he 
began his reign with a belief that he could do what 
he pleased, and with a determination to do it. 

Before we proceed to its principal events, let us 
dispose of Titus Oates. He was tried for perjury a 
fortnight after the coronation, and besides being very 
heavily fined, was sentenced to stand twice in the 
pillory, to be whipped from Aldgate to Newgate one

day, and from Newgate to Tyburn two days afterwards, 
and to stand in the pillory five times a year as long as 
he lived. This fearful sentence was actually inflicted 
on the rascal. Being unable to stand after his first 
flogging, he was dragged on a sledge from Newgate 
to Tyburn, and flogged as he was drawn along. He 
was so strong a villain that he did not die under the 
torture, but lived to be afterwards pardoned and 
rewarded, though not to be ever believed in any 
more. Dangerfield, the only other one of that crew 
left alive, was not so fortunate. He was almost killed 
by a whipping from Newgate to Tyburn, and, as if 
that were not punishment enough, a ferocious barrister 
of Gray’s Inn gave him a poke in the eye with his 
cane, which caused his death ; for which the ferocious 
barrister was deservedly tried and executed. 

As soon as James was on the throne, Argyle and 
Monmouth went from Brussels to Rotterdam, and 
attended a meeting of Scottish exiles held there, to 
concert measures for a rising in England. It was 
agreed that Argyle should effect a landing in Scotland, 
and Monmouth in England; and that two Englishmen 
should be sent with Argyle to be in his confidence, 
and two Scotchmen with the Duke of Monmouth. 

Argyle was the first to act upon this contract.

But, two of his men being taken prisoners at the 
Orkney Islands, the Government became aware of his 
intentions, and was able to act against him with such 
vigor as to prevent his raising more than two or three 
thousand Highlanders, although he sent a fiery cross, 
by trusty messengers, from clan to clan and from glen 
to glen, as the custom then was when those wild people 
were to be excited by their chiefs. As he was moving 
towards Glasgow with his small force, he was betrayed 
by some of his followers, taken, and carried, with his 
hands tied behind his back, to his old prison in 
Edinburgh Castle. James ordered him to be executed, 
on his old shamefully unjust sentence, within three 
days ; and appears to have been anxious that his legs 
should have been pounded with his old favorite the 
boot. However, the boot was not applied; he was 
simply beheaded, and his head was set upon the top 
of Edinburgh Jail. One of those Englishmen who 
had been assigned to him was that old soldier Rumbold, 
the master of the Rye House. He was sorely wounded, 
and within a week after Argyle had suffered with great 
courage, was brought up for trial, lest he should die 
and disappoint the King. He, too, was executed, 
after defending himself with great spirit, and saying 
that he did not believe that God had made the greater

part of mankind to carry saddles on their backs and 
bridles in their mouths, and to be ridden by a few, 
booted and spurred for the purpose — in which I 
thoroughly agree with Bumbold. 

The Duke of Monmouth, partly through being de- 
tained and partly through idling his time away, was 
five or six weeks behind his friend when he landed at 
Lyme, in Dorset : having at his right hand an unlucky 
nobleman called Lord Grey of Were, who of him- 
self would have ruined a far more promising expedition. 
He immediately set up his standard in the market- 
place, and proclaimed the King a tyrant, and a Popish 
usurper, and I know not what else; charging him, 
not only with what he had done, which was bad 
enough, but with what neither he nor anybody else 
had done, such as setting fire to London, and poisoning 
the late King. Baising some four thousand men by 
these means, he marched on to Taunton, where there 
were many Protestant dissenters who were strongly 
opposed to the Catholics. Here, both the rich and 
poor turned out to receive him, ladies waved a welcome 
to him from all the windows as he passed along the 
streets, flowers were strewn in his way, and every 
compliment and honor that could be devised was 
showered upon him. Among the rest, twenty young

ladies came forward, in their best clothes and in their 
brightest beauty, and gave him a Bible ornamented 
with their own fair hands, together with other pre- 
sents. * 

Encouraged by this homage, he proclaimed himself 
King, and went on to Bridgewater. But, here the 
Government troops, under the Earl of Feversham, 
were close at hand ; and he was so dispirited at finding 
that he made but few powerful friends after all, that 
it was a question whether he should disband his 
army and endeavor to escape. It was resolved, at 
the instance of that unlucky Lord Grey, to make a 
night attack on the King’s army, as it lay encamped 
on the edge of a morass called Sedgemoor. The 
horsemen were commanded by the same unlucky lord, 
who was not a brave man. He gave up the battle 
almost at the first obstacle — which was a deep drain ; 
and although the poor countrymen, who had turned 
out for Monmouth, fought bravely with scythes, poles, 
pitchforks, and such poor weapons as they had, they 
were soon dispersed by the trained soldiers, and fled 
in all directions. When the Duke of Monmouth 
himself fled, was not known in the confusion; but 
the unlucky lord was taken early next day, and then 
another of the party was taken, who confessed that

•he had parted from the Duke only four hours before. 
Strict search being made, he was found disguised as 
a peasant, hidden in a ditch under fern and nettles, 
with a few peas in his pocket which he had gathered 
in the fields to eat. The only other articles he had 
upon him were a few papers and little books ; one of 
the latter being a strange jumble, in his own writing, 
of charms, songs, recipes, and prayers. He was 
completely broken. He wrote a miserable letter to 
the King, beseeching and entreating to be allowed to 
see him. When he was taken to London, and con- 
veyed bound into the King’s presence, he crawled 
to him on his knees, and made a most degrading 
exhibition. As James never forgave or relented 
towards any body, he was not likely to soften towards 
the issuer of the Lyme proclamation, so he told the 
suppliant to prepare for death. 

On the fifteenth of July, one thousand six hundred 
and eighty-five, this unfortunate favorite of the people 
was brought out to die on Tower Hill. The crowd 
was immense, and the tops of all the houses were 
covered with gazers. He had seen his wife, the 
daughter of the Duke of Buccleugh, in the Tower, 
and had talked much of a lady whom he loved far 
better — the Lady Harriet Wentworth — who was

one of the last persons he remembered in this life* 
Before laying down his head upon the block he felt 
the edge of the axe, and told the executioner that he 
feared it was not sharp enough, and that the axe was 
not heavy enough. On the executioner replying that 
it was of the proper kind, the Duke said, “ I pray you 
have a care, and do not use me so awkwardly as 
you used my Lord Russell.” The executioner, made 
nervous by this, and trembling, struck once and merely 
gashed him in the neck. Upon this the Duke of 
Monmouth raised his head and looked the man 
reproachfully in the face. Then he struck twice, and 
then thrice, and then threw down the axe, and cried 
out in a voice of horror that he could not finish that 
work. The sheriffs, however, threatening him with 
what should be done to himself if he did not, he took 
it up again and struck a fourth time and a fifth time. 
Then the wretched head at last fell off, and James, 
Duke of Monmouth, was dead, in the thirty-sixth 
year of his age. He was a showy, graceful man, 
with many popular qualities, and had found much 
favor in the open hearts of the English. 

The atrocities, committed by the Government, which 
followed this Monmouth rebellion, form the blackest 
and most lamentable page in English history. The

poor peasants, having been dispersed with great loss, 
and their leaders having been taken, one would think 
that the implacable King might have been satisfied. 
But no ; he let loose upon them, among other 
intolerable monsters, a Colonel Kikk, who had served 
against the Moors, and whose soldiers — called by the 
people Kirk’s lambs, because they bore a lamb upon 
their flag, as the emblem of Christianity — were worthy 
of their leader. The atrocities committed by these 
demons in human shape are far too horrible to be 
related here. It is enough to say, that besides most 
ruthlessly murdering and robbing them, and ruining 
them by making them buy their pardons at the price 
of all they possessed, it was one of Kirk’s favorite 
amusements, as he and his officers sat drinking after 
dinner, and toasting the King, to have batches of 
prisoners hanged outside the windows for the com- 
pany’s diversion ; and that when their feet quivered in 
the convulsions of death, he used to swear that they 
should have music to their dancing, and would order 
the drums to beat and the trumpets to play. The 
detestable King informed him, as an acknowledgment 
of these services, that he was “ very well satisfied with 
his proceedings.” But the King’s great delight was 
in the proceedings of Jeffreys, now a peer, who went

down into the. west, with four other judges, to try 
persons accused of having had any share in the 
rebellion. The King pleasantly called this “ Jeffreys* 
campaign.” The people down in that part of the 
country remember it to this hour as The Bloody 
Assize. 

It began at Winchester, where a poor deaf old lady, 
Mrs. Alicia Lisle, the widow of one of the judges of 
Charles the First (who had been murdered abroad by 
some Royalist assassins), was charged with having 
given shelter in her house to two fugitives from 
Sedgemoor. Three times the jury refused to find her 
guilty, until Jeffreys bullied and frightened them into 
that false verdict. When he had extorted it from 
them, he said, “ Gentlemen, if I had been one of you, 
and she had been my own mother, I would have found 
her guilty;” — as I dare say he would. He sentenced 
her to be burned alive that very afternoon. The clergy 
of the cathedral and some others interfered in her 
favor, and she was beheaded within a week. As a 
high mark of his approbation, the King made Jeffreys 
Lord Chancellor ; and he then went on to Dorchester, 
to Exeter, to Taunton, and to Wells. It is astonishing, 
when we read of the enormous injustice and barbarity 
of this beast, to know tljat no one struck him dead on

the judgment seat. It was enough for any man or 
woman to be accused by an enemy, before Jeffreys, to 
be found guilty of high treason. One man who pleaded 
not guilty, he ordered to be taken out of court upon 
the instant, and hanged; and this so terrified the 
prisoners in general that they mostly pleaded guilty 
at once. At Dorchester alone, in the course of a few 
days, Jeffreys hanged eighty people; besides whipping, 
transporting, imprisoning, and selling as slaves, great 
numbers. He executed, in all, two hundred and fifty or 
three hundred. 

These executions took place, among the neighbors 
and friends of the sentenced, in thirty-six towns and 
villages. Their bodies were mangled, steeped in 
caldrons of boiling pitch and tar, and hung up by the 
roadsides, in the streets, over the very churches. The 
sight and smell of heads and limbs, the hissing and 
bubbling of the infernal caldrons, and the tears and 
terrors of the people, were dreadful beyond all descrip- 
tion. One rustic, who was forced to steep the remains 
in the black pot, was ever afterwards called “ Tom 
Boilman.” The hangman has ever since been called 
Jack Ketch, because a man of that name went hanging 
and hanging, all day long, in the train of Jeffreys. 
You will hear much of the horrors of the great French

Revolution. Many and terrible they were, there is no 
doubt; but I know of nothing worse, done by the 
maddened people of France in that awful time, than 
was done by the highest judge in England, with the 
express approval of the King of England, in The 
Bloody Assize. 

Nor was even this all. Jeffreys was as fond of 
money for himself as of misery for others, and he 
sold pardons wholesale to fill his pockets. The King 
ordered, at one time, a thousand prisoners to be given 
to certain of his favorites, in order that they might 
bargain with them for their pardons. The young 
ladies of Taunton who had presented the Bible, were 
bestowed upon the maids of honor at court; and 
those precious ladies made very hard bargains with 
them indeed. When The Bloody Assize was at its most 
dismal height, the King was diverting himself with 
horse-races in the very place where Mrs. Lisle had 
been executed. When Jeffreys had done his worst, 
and came home again, he was particularly complimented 
in the Royal Gazette ; and when the King heard that 
through drunkenness and raging he was very ill, 
his odious Majesty remarked that such another man 
could not easily be found in England. Besides all 
this, a former sheriff of London, named Cornish,

was hanged within sight of his own house, after an 
abominably conducted trial, for having had a share in 
the Eye House Plot, on evidence given by Eumsey, 
which that villian was obliged to confess was directly 
opposed to the evidence he had given on the trial of 
Lord Eussell. And on the very same day, a worthy 
widow, named Elizabeth Gaunt, was burned alive at 
Tyburn, for having sheltered a wretch who himself 
gave evidence against her. She settled the fuel about 
her with her own hands, so that the flames should 
reach her quickly ; and nobly said, with her last breath, 
that she had obeyed the sacred command of God, to 
give refuge to the outcast, and not to betray the 
wanderer. 

After all this hanging, beheading, burning, boiling, 
mutilating, exposing, robbing, transporting, and selling 
into slavery, of his unhappy subjects, the King not 
unnaturally thought that he could do whatever he 
would. So, he went to work to change the religion 
of the country with all possible speed; and what he 
did was this. 

He first of all tried to get rid of what was called 
the Test Act, — which prevented .the Catholics from 
holding public employments, — by his own power of 

dispensing with the penalties. He tried it in one

case, and, eleven of the twelve judges deciding in his 
favor, he exercised it in three others, being those of 
three dignitaries of University College, Oxford, who 
had become Papists (which such people never do now, 
I believe), and whom he kept in their places and 
sanctioned. He revived the hated Ecclesiastical 
Commission, to get rid of Compton, Bishop of 
London, who manfully opposed him. He solicited 
the Pope to favor England with an ambassador, 
which the Pope (who was a sensible man then) rather 
unwillingly did. He flourished Father Petre before 
the eyes of the people on all possible occasions. He 
favored the establishment of convents in several parts 
of London. He was delighted to have the streets, and 
even the court itself, filled with Monks and Friars in 
the habits of their orders. He constantly endeavored 
to make Catholics of the Protestants about him. He 
held private interviews, which he called “ closetings, ,, 
with those Members of Parliament who held offices, 
to persuade them to consent to the design he had in 
view. When they did not consent, they were removed, 
or resigned of themselves, and their places were given 
to Catholics. He displaced Protestant officers from 
the army by every means in his power, and got 
Catholics into their places too. He tried the same

thing with corporations, and also (though not so 
successfully) with the Lord . Lieutenants of counties. 
To terrify the people into the endurance of all these 
measures, he kept an army of fifteen thousand men 
encamped on Hounslow Heath, where mass was openly 
performed in the General’s tent, and where priests 
went among the soldiers endeavoring to persuade 
them to become Catholics. For circulating a paper 
among those men advising them to be true to their 
religion, a Protestant clergyman, named Johnson, the 
chaplain of the late Lord Russell, was actually sen- 
tenced to stand three times in the pillory, and was 
actually whipped from Newgate to Tyburn. He dis- 
missed his own brother-in-law from his Council 
because he was a Protestant, and made a Privy 
Councillor of the before-mentioned Father Petre. 
He handed Ireland over to Richard Talbot, Earl 
op Tyrconnell, a worthless, dissolute knave, who 
played the same game there for his master, and who 
played the deeper game for himself of one day putting 
it under the protection of the French King. In going 
to these extremities, every man of sense and judgment 
among the Catholics, from the Pope to a porter, 
knew that the King was a mere bigoted fool, who 

would undo himself and the cause he sought to

advance ; but he was deaf to all reason, and, happily 
for England ever afterwards, went tumbling off his 
throne in his own blind way. 

A spirit began to arise in the country, which the 
besotted blunderer little expected. He firfet found it 
out in the University of Cambridge. Having made a 
Catholic, a dean, at Oxford, without any opposition, 
he tried to make a monk a master of arts at Cam- 
bridge: which attempt the University resisted, and 
defeated him. He then went back to his favorite Oxford. 
On the death of the President of Magdalen College, 
he commanded that there should be elected to succeed 
him one Mr. Anthony Farmer, whose only recom- 
mendation was, that he was of the King’s religion. 
The University plucked up courage at last, and refused. 
The King substituted another man, and it still refused, 
resolving to stand by its own election of a Mr. Hough. 
The dull tyrant, upon this, punished Mr. Hough and 
five-and-twenty more, by causing them to be expelled 
and declared incapable of holding any church prefer- 
ment; then he proceeded to what he supposed to 
be his highest step, but to what was, in fact, his' 
last plunge head foremost in his tumble off his 
throne. 

He had issued a declaration that there should be

no religious tests or penal laws, in order to let in the 
Catholics more easily ; but the Protestant dissenters, 
unmindful of themselves, had gallantly joined the 
regular church in opposing it tooth and nail. The 
King and Father Petre now resolved to have this 
read, on a certain Sunday, in all the churches, and 
to order it to be circulated for that purpose by the 
bishops. The latter took counsel with the Archbishop 
of Canterbury, who was in disgrace ; and they resolved 
that the declaration should not be read, and that 
they would petition the King against it. The Arch- 
bishop himself wrote out the petition, and six bishops 
went into the King’s bed-chamber the same night to 
present it, to his infinite astonishment. Next day 
was the Sunday fixed for the reading, and it was only 
read by two hundred clergymen out of ten thousand. 
The King resolved against all advice to prosecute 
the bishops in the Court of King’s Bench, and within 
three weeks they were summoned before the Privy 
Council, and committed to the Tower. As the six 
bishops were taken to that dismal place, by water, 
the people who were assembled in immense numbers 
fell upon their knees, and wept for them, and prayed 
for them. When they got to the Tower, the officers 
and soldiers on guard besought them for their blessing.

While they were confined there, the soldiers every 
day drank to their release with loud shouts. When 
they were brought up to the Court of King’s Bench 
for their trial, which the Attorney- General said was 
for the high offence of censuring the Government, 
and giving their opinion about affairs of state, they 
were attended by similar multitudes, and surrounded 
by a throng of noblemen and gentlemen. When the 
jury went out at seven o’clock at night to consider of 
their verdict, everybody (except the King) knew that 
they would rather starve than yield to the King’s 
brewer, who was one of them, and wanted a verdict 
for his customer. When they came into court next 
morning, after resisting the brewer all night, and gave 
a verdict of not guilty, such a shout rose up in West- 
minster Hall as it had never heard before ; and it 
was passed on among the people away to Temple 
Bar, and away again to the Tower. It did not pass 
only to the east, but passed to the west too, until it 
reached the camp at Hounslow, where the fifteen 
thousand soldiers took it up and echoed it. And 
still, when the dull King, who was then with Tord 
Feversham, heard the mighty roar, asked in alarm 
what it was, and was told that it was “ nothing but 
the acquittal of the bishops,” he said, in his dogged

way, “ Call you that nothing ? It is so much the 
worse for them.” 

Between the petition and the trial, the Queen had 
given birth to a son, which Father Petre rather 
thought was owing to Saint Winifred. But I doubt 
if Saint Winifred had much to do with it as the 
King’s friend, inasmuch as the entirely new prospect 
of a Catholic successor (for both the King’s daughters 
were Protestants) determined the Earls of Shrews- 
bury, Danby, and Devonshire, Lord Lumley, the 
Bishop of London, Admiral Bussell, and Colonel 
Sidney to invite the Prince of Orange over to 
England. The Boyal Mole, seeing his danger at 
last, made, in his fright, many great concessions, 
besides raising an army of forty thousand men ; but 
the Prince of Orange was not a man for James the 
Second to cope with: his preparations were extra- 
ordinarily vigorous, and his mind was resolved. 

For a fortnight after the Prince was ready to sail 
for England, a great wind from the west prevented 
the departure of his fleet Even when the wind lulled, 
and it did sail, it was dispersed by a storm, and was 
obliged to put back to refit. At last, on the first of 
November, one thousand six hundred and eighty-eight, 
the Protestant east wind, as it was long called, began

to blow ; and on the third, the people of Dover and 
the people of Calais saw a fleet twenty miles long 
sailing gallantly by, between the two places. On 
Monday, the fifth, it anchored at Torbay in Devon- 
shire, and the Prince, with a splendid retinue of 
officers and men, marched into Exeter. But the 
people in that western part of the country had suffered 
so much in The Bloody Assize, that they had lost 
heart. Few people joined him ; and he began to think 
of returning, and publishing the invitation he had 
received from those lords, as his justification for having 
come at all. At this crisis, some of the gentry joined 
him ; the Royal army began to falter ; an engagement 
was signed, by which all who set their hand to it, 
declared that they would support one another in 
defence of the laws and liberties of the three Kingdoms,^ 
of the Protestant religion, and of the Prince of Orange. 
From that time, the cause received no check; the 
greatest towns in England began, one after another, 
to declare for the Prince ; and he knew that it was 
all safe with him when the University of Oxford 
offered to melt down its plate, if he wanted any 
money. 

By this time the King was running about in a 
pitiable way, touching people for the King’s evil in

one place, reviewing his troops'in another, and bleeding 
from the nose in a third. The young Prince was sent 
to Portsmouth, Father Petre went off like a shot to 
France, and there was a general and swift dispersal of 
all the priests and friars. One after another, the 
King’s most important officers and friends deserted 
him and went over to the Prince. In the night, his 
daughter Anne fled from Whitehall Palace ; and the 
Bishop of London, who had once been a soldier, rode 
before her with a drawn sword in his hand and pistols 
at his saddle. “ God help me,” cried the miserable 
King : “ my very children have forsaken me ! ” In 
his wildness, after debating with such lords as were 
in London, whether he should or should not call a 
Parliament, and after naming three of them to nego- 
tiate with the Prince, he resolved to fly to France. 
He had the little Prince of Wales brought back from 
Portsmouth; and the child and the Queen crossed 
the river to Lambeth in an open boat, on a miserable 
wet night, and got safely away. This was on the night 
of the ninth of December. 

At one o’clock on the morning of the eleventh, the 
Kin g, who had, in the meantime, received a letter 
from the Prince of Orange, stating his objects, got 
out of bed, told Lord Northumberland who lay in

his room not to open tttte door until the usual hour in 
the morning, and went down the back stairs (the same, 
I suppose, by which the priest in the wig and gown 
had come up to his brother) and crossed the river in 
a small boat: sinking the great seal by the way. 
Horses having been provided, he rode, accompanied 
by Sir Edward Hales, to Feversham, where he em- 
barked in a Custom House Hoy. The master of this 
Hoy wanting more ballast, ran into the Isle of Sheppy 
to get it, where the fishermen and smugglers crowded 
about the boat, and informed the King of their sus- 
picions that he was a “ hatchet-faced Jesuit.” As they 
took his money, and would not let him go, he told them 
who he was, and that the Prince of Orange wanted 
to take his life ; and began to scream for a boat — and 
then to cry, because he had lost a piece of wood on 
his ride which he called a fragment of 'our Saviour's 
cross. He put himself into the hands of the Lord 
Lieutenant of the county, and his detention was made 
known to the Prince of Orange at Windsor — who, only 
wanting to get rid of him, and not caring where he 
went, so that he went away, was very much discon- 
certed that they did not let him go. However, there 
was nothing for it but to have him brought back, with 
some state in the way of Life Guards, to Whitehall.

And as soon as he got there, in his infatuation, he 
heard mass, and set a Jesuit to say grace at his public 
dinner. 

The people had been thrown into the strangest 
state of confusion by his flight, and had taken it into 
their heads that the Irish part of the army were going 
to murder the Protestants. Therefore, they set the 
bells ringing, . and lighted watch-fires, and burned 
Catholic Chapels, and looked about in all directions 
for Father Petre and the Jesuits, while the Pope’s 
ambassador was running away in the dress of a foot- 
man. They found no Jesuits; but a man, who had 
once been a frightened witness before Jeffreys in court, 
saw a swollen, drunken face, looking through a window 
down at Wapping, which he well remembered. The 
face was in a sailor’s dress, but he knew it to be the 
face of that accursed Judge, and he seized him. The 
people, to their lasting honor, did not tear him to 
pieces. After knocking him about a little, they took 
him, in the basest agonies of terror, to the Lord Mayor, 
who sent him, at his own shrieking petitions, to the 
Tower for safety. There, he died. 

Their bewilderment continuing, the people now. 
lighted bonfires and made rejoicings, as if they had any 
reason to be glad to have the King back again. But,

his stay was very short, for the English guards were 
removed from Whitehall, Dutch guards were marched 
up to it, and he was told by one of his late ministers 
that the Prince would enter London next day and he 
had better go to Ham. He said, Ham was a cold damp 
place, and he would rather go to Rochester. He 
thought himself very cunning in this, as he meant to 
escape from Rochester to France. The Prince of 
Orange and his friends knew that, perfectly well, and 
desired nothing more. So, he went to Gravesend, in 
his royal barge, attended by certain lords, and watched 
by Dutch troops, and pitied by the generous people, 
who were far more forgiving than he had ever been, 
when they saw him in his humiliation. On the night 
of the twenty-third of December, not even then under- 
standing that everybody wanted to get rid of him, he 
went out, absurdly, through his Rochester garden, 
down to the Medway, and got away to France, where 
he rejoined the Queen. 

There had been a council in his absence, of the 
lords, and the authorities of London. When the 
Prince came, on the day after the King’s departure, he 
summoned the Lords to meet him, and soon afterwards, 
all those who had served in any of the Parliaments of 
King Charles the Second. It was finally resolved by

these authorities that the throne was vacant by the 
conduct of King James the Second, that it was incon- 
sistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant 
kingdom to be governed by a Popish prince, that the 
Prince and Princess of Orange should be King and 
Queen during their lives and the life of the survivor of 
them, and that their children should succeed them if 
they had any. That if they had none, the Princess 
Anne and her children should succeed ; that if she had 
none, the heirs of the Prince of Orange. 

On the thirteenth of January, one thousand six 
hundred and eighty-nine, the Prince and Princess, 
sitting on a throne in Whitehall, bound themselves to 
these conditions. The Protestant religion was estab- 
lished in England, and England’s great and glorious 
Revolution was complete.

William and Mary reigned together, five years. 
After the death of his good wife, William occupied 
the throne, alone, for seven years longer. During his 
reign, on the sixteenth of September one thousand 
seven hundred and one, the poor weak creature who 
had once been James the Second of England, died 
in France. In the meantime he had done his utmost 
(which was not much) to cause William to be assas- 
sinated, and to regain his lost dominions. James’s 
son was declared, by the French King, the right- 
ful King of England ; and was called in France 
The Chevalier Saint George, and in England 
The Pretender. Some infatuated people in England, 
and particularly in Scotland, took up the Pretender’s 
cause from time to time — as if the country had 
not, to its cost, had Stuarts enough ! — and many lives 
were sacrificed, and much misery occasioned. King 
William died on Sunday, the seventh of March, one 
thousand seven hundred and two^ of the consequences 
of an accident occasioned by his horse stumbling with 
him. He was always a brave patriotic Prince, and a 
man of remarkable abilities. His manner was cold, and 
he made but few friends ; but he had truly loved his 
queen. When he was dead, a lock of her hair, in a ring, 
was found tied with a black ribbon round his left arm.

He was succeeded by the Princess Anne, a popular 
Queen, who reigned twelve years. In her reign, in 
the month of May, one thousand seven hundred and 
seven, the Union between England and Scotland was 
effected, and the two countries were incorporated under 
the name of Great Britain. Then, from the Year 
one thousand seven hundred and fourteen to the year 
one thousand eight hundred and thirty, reigned the 
four Georges. 

It was in the reign of George the Second, one 
thousand seven hundred and forty-five, that the 
Pretender did his last mischief, and made his last 
appearance. Being an old man, by that time, he and 
the Jacobites — as his friends were called — put forward 
his son, Charles Edward, known as the Young 
Chevalier. The Highlanders of Scotland, an extremely 
troublesome and wrong-headed race on the subject of 
the Stuarts, espoused his cause, and he joined them, 
and there was a Scottish rebellion to make him king, 
in which many gallant and devoted gentlemen lost 
their lives. It was a hard matter for Charles Edward 
to escape abroad again, with a high price on his head ; 
but the Scottish people were extraordinarily faithful 
to him, and after undergoing many romantic adventures, 
not unlike those of Charles the Second, he escaped

to France. A number of charming stories . and 
delightful songs arose out of the Jacobite feelings, 
and belong to the Jacobite times. Otherwise I think 
the Stuarts were a public nuisance altogether. 

It was in the reign of George the Third that 
England lost North America, by persisting in taxing 
her without her own consent. That immense country, 
made independent under Washington, and left to 
itself, became the United States ; one of the greatest 
nations of the earth. In these times in which I write, 
it is honorably remarkable for protecting its subjects, 
wherever they may travel, with a dignity and a deter- 
mination which is a model for England. Between you 
and me, England has rather lost ground in this respect 
since the days of Oliver Cromwell. 

The Union of Great Britain with Ireland — which 
had been getting on very badly by itself — took place in 
the reign of George the Third, on the second of July, 
one thousand seven hundred and ninety- eight. 

William the Fourth succeeded George the Fourth 
in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty, and 
reigned seven years. Queen Victoria, his niece, the 
only child of the Duke of Kent, the fourth son of 
George the Third, came to the throne on the twentieth 
of June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven.
