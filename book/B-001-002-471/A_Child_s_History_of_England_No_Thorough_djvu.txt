INTRODUCTION. 


“He dictated from week to week the papers which 
formed this little work” — the only book which he ever 
dictated — “ and cannot be said to have quite hit the mark 
with it,” says Mr. Forster. The date was the autumn of 
1853. The “Child’s History” certainly does not rank 
with the “Tales of a Grandfather.” Dickens had not 
given many years to original historical studies, nor had he 
much sympathy with the past. He had little of the his- 
torical sense. Writing as a middle-class early Victorian 
radical, he is merely ^astonished by the stupidity of our 
ancestors. They suffered much from, and endured much 
for, many kings, and what kings! How odd was their 
conduct! That represents Dickens’s attitude of mind. 
He calls the Highlanders “ an extremely 1 troublesome and 
wrong-headed race on the subject of the Stuarts,” and 
expects children to sympathise^ Now every natural un- 
corrupted child is a Jacobite, and plans his own conspira- 
cies, like Mr. Barrie’s Sentimental Tommy. King for 
king, there is no doubt as to which of the rival Houses 
offered the “nicer” and handsomer choice to the nation, 
and a child’s politics are influenced by these considera- 
tions, and by a generous love of the lost cause, of the long 
romance which Dickens dismisses in a page. 

He writes no scientific history. What did the Conquest 
mean for England? Domesday Book, curfew-bell, Nor- 
man dresses, Norman masters and manners— a child gets 
no more from Dickens. To be sure, he does not clamour 
for more. Johnny Lockhart sent a. message to his grand- 
father, “ he very much dislikes the chapter on Civilisation, 
and it is his desire that you will never say any more about 
it, for he dislikes it extremely.” Dirks were enough for 
Master Lockhart. But, if one may speak for oneself 
(eetat. ix.), Sir Walter’s exposition of the feudal ideal was 
lucid and highly interesting, “ Here,” one thought, “ was

INTRODUCTION. 


a right notion of how to live;" and it is probable that, if 
children are to be taught history, they can easily be made 
to see that feudalism was a society with an idea. Dickens 
makes no effort to reach a child's intelligence on this point. 
Take, again, the Reformation. What notion does a child 
get from Dickens about the Reformation- l -about “ Luther's 
ideas"? On the other hand, Dickens writes here with a 
fine impartiality, and lets a child understand that the 
Reformation was dishonest, brutal, and blundering; that 
Henry VIII., being his own Pope, impartially burned both 
sides, and was, in a famous phrase, “ a blot of blood and 
grease upon the History of England." But as to how 
Henry found his infamous career possible, a child does 
not learn from Dickens. 

Thus the book is not educational. It may be said that 
a child does not need to be taught the meaning of events, 
but only to learn (probably he will never learn more) 
about Alfred and the cakes, about the curfew-bell, Perkin 
Warbeck, Mary and Elizabeth, Fair Rosamond, the 
death of Charles I., the coming of the Prince of Orange, 
Jane Shore, and so on. Scientific writers on education 
may argue the point, but probably Dickens did not aim at 
a school-book. He wanted to interest (nor is it useful to 
write history which does not interest) and to propagate 
his own ideas, which are not historical, but are always op- 
posed to cruelty and oppression. 

It is superfluous to point out errors. Dickens denies 
to the early Celtic people of the island the use of coins: 
“they made no coins." One appeals to Sir John Evans 
and the museums. Had Kent a white horse for standard 
before the English invasion? “The neighings of the wild 
white horse" are not British, in the “ Idylls of the King." 
Did the Druids erect Stonehenge, “ keeping the people out 
of sight while they made these buildings," which demanded 
the labour of a whole population? What hills in Scot- 
land “are supposed to be" the cairns of the Caledonians 
who fell in resisting Agricola? Who supposes that they 
had this origin? 

A kind of historical irreverence often marks the tone. 
James I. is always “His Sowship." The suggested 
“twelve hundred monkeys" of Thomas k Becket on 
horseback remind us of that spectacle against which the 
nerves 9 £ Mr. Winkle’s horse were supposed to be proof.

INTRODUCTION. 


vii 

One does not feel convinced that St. Patrick laboured 
“before any Pope existed.” 

The Scottish child, at least, will not be edified by Dickens. 
Scotland “had a little king of its own, about whom the 
people were always quarrelling and fighting, and making 
a prodigious disturbance, a great deal more than he was 
worth.” And this in the age of “The Kings of Peace!” 
The controversy as to England’s suzerainty is, mercifully, 
omitted. Happily Wallace, not being royal, appears as 
“ the most resolute and undaunted champion of a people 
struggling for their independence that ever lived upon the 
earth.” But who is Bruce’s friend, “Sir John Douglas”? 
Can he be the good Sir James? Did he roast the bodies 
in the Douglas larder? Not he; he threw them down a 
well. A larder is not a kitchen; “cookery” there was 
none. Let us resist the temptation to criticise the account 
of the battle of Bannockburn! 

Jeanne d’ Arc is a figure attractive to a child. She is not 
happy in Dickens’s hands. She was not “ in her twentieth 
year” in 1429, but in her seventeenth. She was not “a 
moping, fanciful girl . . . wishful for notoriety.” She 
4 was “ notorious” merely for her skill in spinning and sew- 
ing. She did not vow “never” to have a husband, but 
only not to wed till she had done her work. It was not “ a 
long way” to travel from Domremy to Vaucouleurs. 
And what was Jeanne's “disorder”? She was a miracle 
of health and strength. The Maid did not ask the King 
to send her home after the coronation at Rheums. I never 
| heard that Charles gave her “the income of a Count,” 
whatever that may be. She asked that her native village 
might be relieved from taxation, and obtained the boon. 
No authority describes the martyr at the stake as “a 
shrieking girl;” we hear of no shrieks, only of her last 
word, Jesus. Dickens ends by speaking of statues 
| “which commemorate . . . much greater impostors.” 
This is neither a true description of the Venerable Jeanne, 
nor a view to place before children, of one who, herself 
scarcely more than a child, loved to assemble the little ones 
about her, and, in their society, sought peace in her dark 
| hour, when the time was come that she should be de- 
livered up. The accounts of “the Puzel” which the 
English chroniclers borrowed, with additions of their own, 

I from the Burgundian writers, had filtered through the

ages to Dickens, and, while his hatred of cruelty made him 
detest the murderers of the Fucelle, his anxious common 
sense, at war with his native bent, caused him to distrust 
her as “ disordered,” fond of notoriety, “ moping/’ and 
more or less of an “ impostor.” 

He never mentions his authorities, but he probably 
followed Lingard,* who, though a Catholic, was much more 
strongly opposed to Jeanne, much less capable of a chival- 
rous appreciation, than the free-thinking Hume. Indeed, 
it is from Lingard that Dickens borrows the statement 
about “the grant of an income equal to that of an Earl.” 
This Lingard took from Monstrelet, a Burgundian, and an 
enemy. The statement is entirely groundless, to the best 
of my knowledge, f 

Coming to a part of history always interesting to chil- 
dren, the rivalry of Elizabeth Tudor and Mary Stuart, 
Dickens is not always accurate, but he is impartial. “ The 
deceitful character of Mary, and the deceitful character of 
Elizabeth, have rendered almost every part of their joint 
history uncertain and obscure.” Admirers of the Puri- 
tans, “for the most part an uncomfortable people, who 
thought it highly meritorious to dress in a hideous manner, 
and talk through their noses,” may wage their own feud 
with Dickens; and Dr. Gardiner obviously does not agree 
with his estimate of James I., while Sir John Skelton is not 
more friendly to his theory of Charles I. 

Dickens's “ merry h Charles II. slightly recalls that other 
“ merry old gentleman,” Fagin, in “ Oliver Twist." Using 
the refrain of “merry," Dickens tells of Charles's faults, 
with no allowance for his qualities. The account of the 
Covenanters leaves, as usual, the perfectly false impression 
that these determined men were martyrs of freedom of 
conscience, a thing which, of all others, they detested arid 
denounced. However, that they were martyrs of free- 
dom of conscience is the traditional opinion, and is likely 
to. prevail. 

The history does notdekl with ideas, and thus the course 
of events seems a picturesque, brutal, purposeless scram- 
ble. It appears probable that intelligent children are not 
inaccessible to ideas, if plainly and simply stated. This

is a pr&Gtic&l question for teacheiu A histbty for children 
ought to be picturesque, even legendafy; for if they do 
not learn the legends when young; they will never learn 
them, but will be patterns of exemplary and exhaustive 
ignorance. 

It is curious to compare Dickens's book With that of 
Mrs. Creighton, “A First History ' of England.” Mrs. 
Creighton remarks that the Romans taught the Britons 
“to mould clay and bake it iiitO pdts.”' The Britons 
were potters long before Julius Caesar came, and a grown- 
up reader is hardly satisfied here with either author. 
Both believe in Edgar’s eight, manned by kings. A 
Scottish reader will prefer Mr. Robertson’s confutation. 
Edgar suffers grievous things from Dickens; Mrs. Creigh- 
ton has a good word for his bHe noire , Dunstan. Dickens 
rejoices much more in moral judgments: he speaks his 
mind vigorously about the baseness of Elizabeth, and the 
brutalities of her father. A child will certainly prefer 
the masterly vigour of many of Dickens’s descriptive 
passages (such as the attempted murder of Edward I., 
Chapter XVI.; and Wat Tyler’s rising, and Flodden Field 
--in fact, any account of action) to the tameness of 
“scientific” school histories. Dickens’s people are human 
and living, if he is no philosophical or erudite historian. 
A child may be happy (though shocked) with Dickens, 
as a man is with Mr. Froude. A man learns to understand 
how history appeared in Dickens’s eyes — in the eyes of 
a Liberal who had not reflected profoundly on the intri- 
cate conditions of the past. He may not always instruct, 
but he never wearies, and a pleasing conflict of opinion 
between author and student is waged to the end, when we 
come, at last, to a good crowned head, and unite in loyalty 
to Queen Victoria. The grown-up reader will be enter- 
tained, throughout, by vivacities on which criticism may 
frown, and the readers are very few who will not know 
more, when they close, than they did when they opened 
the history. 

Dickens scarcely ever cites his authorities. It is most 
improbable that he made any critical research into the 
old Latin historians, or the various editions of the Eng- 
lish Chronicle. He was a reader of the modern historians 
before Mr. Freeman, Mr. Froude, and Dr. Gardiner. It is 
not worth while to compare their views with his; he is a

rapid and humorous follower of a school earlier, and, if not 
less exact, certainly less thoroughly informed. History, 
in the constant affluence of fresh documents, changes 
as rapidly as science alters under the stress of new dis- 
coveries. Nobody will study the “Child's History" 
in search of exact information, and of facts or theories 
“ up to date," therefore laborious comparisons of views and 
authorities would be out of place. A few typical errors 
have been noted in the preceding pages.

I. 

Dickens never attained to a theory of reform; it was 
not in his mind, his character, to elaborate such reflections. 
What he thought about the bygone story of his country 
we can read in the series of chapters which he wrote for 
“Household Words," and afterwards published as the 
“Child's History of England." As literature it is not 
happy; only too often one is reminded (at a great distance 
certainly) of that disgusting series of books called Comic 
Histories, which some-one or other disgraced himself by 
writing. Dickens had no serious historical knowledge, 
and no true understanding of what is meant by history; 
his volume shows a series of more or less grotesque 
sovereigns, who play pranks before high heaven at the 
expense of the multitudes they are supposed to rule by 
divine right. Most unfortunate would be the child into 
whose hand this “history" was put. The one clear sug- 
gestion we carry away after trying to read it, is that Dick- 
ens congratulated himself on living in the nineteenth 
century, a subject of Queen Victoria. It was part of his 
Radicalism to speak of “the bad old times," and true 
history of course not seldom justifies him. After a visit 
to Chillon, he writes an admirable letter of description 
and ends exclaiming — “Good God, the greatest mystery 
in all the earth, to me, is how or why the world was toler- 
ated by its Creator through the good old times, and 
wasn't dashed to fragments." It was natural that he had 
no profound love of Walter Scott, who must often have 
excited his impatience. The past, to his mind, was much 
better forgotten. That the world progressed, he never for 
a moment held in doubt; but the rate of progress was not 
at all in keeping with his energetic habits.

CRITICAL COMMENTS. 


n. 

A history of England, written by Charles Dickens for 
his own or any onp. pise's children, k was.sipr^ to be a dif- 
ferent work fibril one written iliiaer Similar circumstances 
by Mr. Freeman or the late M.-Guizot. The book, though 
it cannot be called a success, is, however, by no means 
devoid of interest. Just ten years earlier he had written, 
and printed, a history of England for the benefit of his 
eldest son, then a hopeful student of .the, age of five, 
which was composed, as fie informed Douglas Jerrold at 
the time, “ in .the exact spirit ” of that advanced politician's 
paper, “ for I don't know what I should do if he were to get 
hold of any Conservative of High Church .notions; and the 
best way of guarding against any such horrible result is, 
I take it, to wring the parrots' necks in his very cradle." 
The “Child's History of England" is written .in the same 
spirit, and illustrates more directly, and, it must be added, 
more coarsely than any of Dickens's other works, his 
hatred of ecclesiasticism of all kinds, Thus, the account 
of Dunstan is pervaded by a prejudice which is the fruit of 
anything but knowledge; Edward the Confessor is “the 
dreary old" and “the maudlin Confessor"; and the Pope 
and what belongs to him are treated with a measure of 
contumely which would have satisfied the heart of Leigh 
Hunt himself. To be sure, if King John is dismissed as a 
“miserable brute," King Henry the Eighth is not more 
courteously designated as a “blot of blood and grease 
upon the history of England." On the other hand, it 
could hardly be but that certain passages of the national 
story should be well told by so great a master of narrative; 
and though the strain in which parts of .the history of 
Charles the Second are recounted strikes one as hardly 
suitable to the young, to whom irony is in general caviare 
indeed, yet there are touches both in the story of “this 
merry gentleman" — a designation which almost recalls 
Fagin — and elsewhere in the book not unworthy of its 
author. Its patriotic spirit is quite as striking as its radi- 
calism; and vulgar as some of its expressions must be 
called, there is a pleasing glow in the passage on King 
Alfred, which declares the “English-Saxon" character to 
have been “ the greatest character among the nations of the

earth”; and there is a yet nobler enthusiasm, such as it 
would, indeed, be worth any writer’s while to infuse into 
the young, in the passionate earnestness with which, by 
means of the story of Agincourt, the truth is enforced that 
“nothing can make war otherwise than horrible.” 

Adolphus William Ward: Dickens . 

Ill, 

A collection of the works of Dickens would be in- 
complete in an essential as well as a literal sense without 
his “Child’s History of England.” It may not be impor- 
tant as a contribution to history, but it is important 
as a contribution to biography ; as a contribution to the 
character and the career of the man who wrote it, a typical 
man of his time. That he had made no personal historical 
researches, that he had no special historical learning, 
that he had not had, in truth, even anything that could 
be called a good education, all this only accentuates not 
the merit but at least the importance of the book. For 
here we may read in plain popular language, written by a 
man whose genius for popular exposition has never been 
surpassed among men, a brief account of the origin and 
meaning of England as it seemed to the average English- 
men of that age. When subtler views of our history, some 
more false and some more true than his, have become pop- 
ular, or at least well known, when in the near future Carly- 
lean or Catholic or Marxian views of history have spread 
themselves among the reading public, this book will 
always remain as a bright and brisk summary of the 
cock-sure, healthy-minded, essentially manly and essen- 
tially ungen tlemanly view of history which characterised 
the Radicals of that particular Radical era. The history 
tells us nothing about the periods that it talks about; but 
it tells us a great deal about the period that it does not 
talk about; the period in which it was written. It is in 
no sense a history of England from the Roman invasion; 
but it is certainly one of the documents which will con- 
tribute to a history of England in the nineteenth century. 

Of the actual nature of its philosophical and technical 
limitations it is, I suppose, unnecessary to speak. They 
all resolve themselves into one fault common in ’ the 
modern world, and certainly characteristic of historians

much more learned and pretentious than Dickens. That 
fault consists simply in ignoring or underrating the variety 
of violent evils and definite dangers in the world. The 
Radicals of the early nineteenth century were engaged, 
and most righteously engaged, in dealing with one particu- 
lar problem of human civilisation; they were shifting and 
apportioning more equally a load of custom that had 
really become unmeaning, often accidental, and nearly 
always unfair. Thus, for instance, a fierce and fighting 
penal code which had been perfectly natural when the 
robbers were as strong as the Government, had become in 
more ordered times nothing but a base and bloody habit. 
Thus again Church powers and dues which had been hu- 
man when every man felt the Church as the best part of 
himself, were mere mean privileges when the nation was 
full of sects and full of freethinkers. This clearing away of 
external symbols that no longer symbolised anything was 
an honourable and admirable work; but it was so difficult 
that to the men engaged in it it blocked up the perspec- 
tive and filled the sky, so that they slid into a very natural 
mental mistake which coloured all their views of history. 
They supposed that this particular problem on which they 
were engaged was the one problem upon which all man- 
kind had always been engaged. They got it into their 
heads that breaking away from a dead past was the per- 
petual process of humanity. The truth is obviously that 
humanity has found itself in many difficulties very different 
from that. Sometimes the best business of an age is to re- 
sist some alien invasion ; sometimes to preach practical self- 
control in a world too self-indulgent and diffused; some- 
times to prevent the growth in the state of great new 
private enterprises that would poison or oppress it. 
Above all it may sometimes happen that the highest task 
of a thinking citizen may be to do the exact opposite of 
the work which the Radicals had to do. It may be his 
highest duty to cling on to evejy scrap of the past that he 
can find, if he feels that the ground is giving way beneath 
him and sinking into mere savagery and forgetfulness of 
all human culture. This was exactly the position of all 
thinking men in what we call the dark ages, say from the 
sixth to the tenth century. The cheap progressive view 
of history can never make head or tail of that epoch; it 
was an epoch upside down. We think of the old things

as barbaric and the new things as enlightened. In that 
age all the enlightened things were old; all the barbaric 
and brutally ignorant things were new and up to date. 
Republicanism was a fading legend; despotism was a new 
and successful experiment. Christianity was not only 
better than the clans that rebelled against it; Christianity 
was more rationalistic than they were. When men looked 
back they saw progress and reason; when they looked 
forward they saw shapeless tradition and tribal terror. 
Touching such an age it is obvious that all our modern 
terms describing reform or conservation are foolish and 
beside the mark. The Conservative was then the only 
possible reformer. If a man did not strengthen the re- 
mains of Roman order and the root of Roman Christianity, 
he was simply helping the world to roll downhill into ruin 
and idiotcy. Remember all these evident historical 
truths and then turn to the account given by Charles 
Dickens of that great man, St. Dunstan. It is not that 
the pert cockney tone of the abuse is irritating to the 
nerves; it is that he has got the whole hang of the thing 
wrong. His head is full of the nineteenth-century situa- 
tion; that a priest imposing discipline is a person some- 
how blocking the way to equality and light. Whereas the 
point about such a man as Dunstan was that nobody in 
the place except him cared a button about equality or 
light; and that he was defending what was left of them 
against the young and growing power of darkness and 
division and caste. 

Nevertheless the case against such books as this is com- 
monly stated wrong. The fault of Dickens is not (as is 
often said) that he “ applies the same moral standard to all 
ages.” Every sane man must do that: a moral standard 
must remain the same or it is not a moral standard. If 
we call St. Anthony of Padua a good man we must mean 
what we mean when we call Huxley a good man; or else 
there is no sense in using the word “ good.” The fault of 
the Dickens school of popular history lies not in the ap- 
plication of a plain rule of right and wrong to all circum- 
stances but in ignorance of the circumstances to which 
it was applied. It is not that they wrongly enforce the 
fixed principle that life should be saved; it is that they 
take a fire-engine to a shipwreck and a life-boat to a house 
on fire. The business of a good man in Dickens’s time

was to brihg justice up to date. The business of a good 
man in Duhstan’s time was to toil to ensure the survival of 
any justice at all. 

And Dickens, through being a living and fighting man of 
his own time, kept the health of his own heart, and so saw 
many truths with a single eye: the truths that were spoilt 
for subtler eyes. He was much more really right than 
Carlyle; immeasurably more right than Froude. He 
was mote right precisely because he applied plain human 
morals to all facts as he saw them. Carlyle really had a 
vague idea that in coarse and cruel times it was right to 
be coarse and cruel; that tyranny was excusable in the 
twelfth century: as if the twelfth century did not denounce 
tyrants as much or more than any other. Carlyle, in 
fact, fancied that Rufus was the right sort of man; a view 
which w£s not only not shared by Anselm, but was prob- 
ably not shared by Rufus. In this connection, or rathfer in 
connection with the other case of Froude, it is worth while 
to take another figure from Dickens’s history, which 
illustrates the other and better side of the facile and 
popular method. Sheer ignorance of the environment 
made him wrong about Dunstan. But sheer instinct and 
good moral tradition made him right, for instance, about 
Henry VIII.; right where Froude is wildly wrong. Dick- 
ens^ imagination could not repicture an age where learning 
and liberty were dying father than being born: but 
Henry VIII. lived in a time of expounding knowledge and 
unrest; a time therefore somewhat like the Victorian. 
And Dickens in his childish but robust way does perceive 
the main point about him: that he was a wicked man. He 
misses all the fine shades of course; he makes him every 
kind of wicked man at once. He leaves out the serious 
interests of the man; his strange but real interest in 
theology; his love of certain legal and moral forms; his 
half-unconscious patriotism. But he sees the solid bulk 
of definite badness simply because it was there; and 
Froude cannot see it at all; because Froude followed Car- 
lyle and played tricks with the eternal conscience. Henry 
VIII. was “a blot of blood and grease upop the history 
of England.” For he was the embodiment of the Devil 
in the Renascence, that wild worship of mere pleasure 
and sfcorn; which with its pictures and its palaces has en- 
riched and ruined the world* , . , ...

The time will soon come when the mere common sense 
of Dickens, like the mere common sense of Macaulay 
(though his was poisoned by learning and Whig politics), 
will appear to give a plainer and therefore truer picture of 
the mass of history than the mystical perversity of a man 
of genius writing only out of his own temperament, like 
Carlyle or Taine. If a man has a new theory of ethics 
there is one thing he must not be allowed to do. Let him 
give laws on Sinai, let him dictate a Bible, let him fill the 
world with cathedrals if he can. But he must not be 
allowed to write a history of England; or a history of 
any country. All history was conducted on ordinary 
morality: with his extraordinary morality he is certain to 
read it all askew. Thus Carlyle tries to write of the Mid- 
dle Ages with a bias against humility and mercy; that is, 
with a bias against the whole theoretic morality of the 
Middle Ages. The result is that he turns into a mere tur- 
moil of arrogant German savages what was really the 
most complete and logical, if not the highest of human 
civilisation. Historically speaking, it is better to be Dick- 
ens than to be this; better to be ignorant, provincial, slap- 
dash, seeing only the passing moment, but, in that mo- 
ment, to be true to eternal things. 

It must be remembered, of course, that Dickens deliber- 
ately offers this only as a “child's” history of England. 
That is, he only professes to be able to teach history as any 
father of a little boy of five professes to be able to teach him 
history. And although the history of England would 
certainly be taught very differently (as regards the actual 
criticism of events and men) in a family with a wider cul- 
ture or with another religion, the general method would 
be the same. For the general method is quite right. 
This black-and-white history of heroes and villains; this 
history full of pugnacious ethics and of nothing else, is 
the right kind of history for children. I have often won- 
dered how the scientific Marxians and the believers in “ the 
materialist view of history” will ever manage to teach 
their dreary economic generalisations to children: but 
I suppose they will have no children. Dickens's history 
will always be popular with the young; almost as popular 
as Dickens's novels, and for the same reason: because it is 
full of moralising. Science or art without morality are not 
dangerous in the sense commonly supposed. They are not

dangerous like a fire, but dangerous like a fog. A fire is 
dangerous in its brightness; a fog for its dulness; and 
thought without morals is merely dull, like a fog. The 
fog seems to be creeping up the street; putting out lamp 
after lamp. But this cockney lamp-post which the chil- 
dren love is still crowned with its flame; and when the 
fathers have forgotten ethics, their babies will turn and 
teach them.

A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


( 


CHAPTER I. 

ANCIENT ENGLAND AND THE ROMANS. 

If you look at a Map of the World, you will see, in the 
left-hand upper corner of the Eastern Hemisphere, two 
Islands lying in the sea. They are England and Scotland, 

I and Ireland. England and Scotland form the greater part 
j of these Islands. Ireland is the next in size. The little 
neighbouring islands, which are so small upon the Map as 
to be mere dots, are chiefly little bits of Scotland — broken 
off, I dare say, in the course of a great length of time, by 
the power of the restless water. 

In the old days, a long, long while ago, before Our 
Saviour was bom on earth and lay asleep in a manger, 
these Islands were in the same place, and the stormy sea 
roared round them, just as it roars now. But the sea was 
not alive, then, with great ships and brave sailors, sailing 
to and from all parts of the world. It was very lonely. 
The Islands lay solitary, in the great expanse of water. 
The foaming waves dashed against their cliffs, and the bleak 
winds blew over their forests; but the winds and waves 
brought no adventurers to land upon the Islands, and the 
savage Islanders knew nothing of the rest of the world, and 
the rest of the world knew nothing of them. 

It is supposed that the Phoenicians, who were an ancient 
people, famous for carrying on trade, came in ships to these 
Islands, and found that they produced tin and lead; both 
very useful things, as you know, and both produced to this 
very hour upon the sea-coast. The most celebrated tin 
mines in Cornwall are, still, close to the sea. One of them, 
which I have seen, is so close to it that it is hollowed out 
underneath the ocean; and the miners say, that in stormy 
weather, when they are at work down in that deep place,

they can hear the noise of the waves thundering above their 
heads. So, the Phoenicians, coasting about the Islands, 
would come, without much difficulty, to where the tin and 
lead were. 

yhe Phoenicians trade4 with the Islanders for these 
metals, and gave the Islanders some other useful things in 
exchange. The Islanders were, at first, poor savages, go- 
ing almost naked, or only dressed in the rough skins of 
beasts, and staining their bodies, as other savages do, with 
coloured earths and the juices of plants. But the Phoeni- 
cians, sailing over to the opposite coasts of France and Bel- 
gium, and saying to the people there, “We have been to 
those white cliffs across the water, which you can see in 
fine weather, and from that country, which is called Brit- 
ain, we bring this tin and lead,” tempted some of the 
French and Belgians to come over also. These people set- 
tled themselves on the south coast of England, which is 
now called Kent; and, although they were a rough people 
tod, they taught the savage Britons some useful arts, and 
improved that part of the Islands. It is probable that 
other people came over from Spain to Ireland, and settled 
there. 

Thus, by little and little, strangers became mixed with 
the Islanders, and the savage Britons grew into a wild bold 
people; almost savage, still, especially in thB interior of 
the country away from the sea wheye the foreign settlers 
seldom went; but hardy, brave, and strong. 

The whole countiy was covered with forests, and swamps. 
The greater part of it was very misty and cold. There 
were no roads, no bridges, no streets, no houses that you 
would think deserving of the name* A town was nothing 
but a collection of straw-covered huts, hidden in a thick 
wood, with a ditch all round, and a low wall, made of mud, 
or the trunks of trees placed one upon another. The peo- 
ple planted little or no corn, but lived upon the flesh of 
their flocks and cattle. They made no coins, but used 
metal rings for money. They were clever in’ basket-work, 
as savage people often are ; and they could ipake a coarse 
kind of cloth, and some very bad earthenware. But in 
building fortresses they were much more clever. 

They made boats of basket-work, covered with the skins 
of animals, but seldom, if ever, venfaired far from the 
shore. They made swords, of copper mixed with tin; but.

these swords Wefce of an awkwafd shape; and s 6 Soft that a 
heavy blow would bend one. They made light shields; 
short pointed daggers, and spears — which they jerked back 
after they hdd thrown them at ail enemy; by a long strip 
of leathei* fastened to the stem. The butt-end was a rat-> 
tie, to frighten ah enemy’s horse. The ancient Britons, 
being divided into as many as thirty or forty tribes, each 
commanded by its own little king, were constantly fighting 
with one another, as savdge people usually do; and they 
always fought with these weapons. 

They were very fond bf hdrses: The standard of Kent 
was the picthre of a white horse. They could break them 
in and manage them wonderfully well. Indeed, the horses 
(of Which they had an abundance, though they were rhther 
small) were so well taught in those days; that they can 
scarcely be said to have improved since; thdugh the men 
are so mhch wiser. They understood, and bbeyed, every 
word of command; and would stand still by themselves; 
in all the din and nbise of battle, while their masters went 
to light on foot. The Britohs bould not have succeeded in 
their most remarkable art, without, the aid of these sensible 
and trusty aniinals. The art I mean, is the cbnstruction 
and inanagement of war-chariots or cars, for Which thejr 
have ever been celebrated in history. Each df the best 
sort of these chariots; nbt quite breast high in froht; and 
open at the back, contained one man to drive, and two or 
three otherS to fight — dll standing up; The horses who 
drew them were so well trained, that they Would tear, at 
full gallop; dver the most Stony ways; and even through 
the woods; dashing down their masters’ enemies bbneath. 
their hodfs; and cutting them to pieces With thb blades of 
swoirds; or scythes, which were fastened tb the wheels; and 
stretched but bey odd the car on each side, for « that crtiel 
purpose. In a moment; while at full speed, the horses 
would stop, at the driver’s eoihmand. The men within 
would leap out, deal blows dbdut them with their swords: 
like hail, leap on the horses; on the pole, spring back into 
the chariots anyhow; and, as soon hs they were skfe, the; 
bortes tdre away again. j 

The Britons had a Strange and terrible religion, called 
the Religion of the Druids. It seems to have been brought 
over; in very early times indeed, from the opposite' cbuntry 
of France, anciently called Gaul, and to have mixed mp. the

worship of the Serpent, and of the Sun and Moon, with the 
worship of some of the Heathen Gods and Goddesses. 
Most of its ceremonies were kept secret by the priests, the 
Druids, who pretended to be enchanters, and who carried 
magicians’ wands, and wore, each of them, about his neck, 
what he told the ignorant people was a Serpent’s egg in a 
golden case. But it is certain that the Druidical cere- 
monies included the sacrifice of human victims, the torture 
of some suspected criminals, and, on particular occasions, 
even the burning alive, in immense wicker cages, of a 
number of men and animals together. The Druid Priests 
had some kind of veneration for the Oak, and for the mis- 
tletoe — the same plant that we hang up in houses at Christ- 
mas Time now — when its white berries grew upon the Oak. 
They met together in dark woods, which they called Saered 
Groves; and there they instructed, in their mysterious arts, 
young men who came to them as pupils, and who some- 
times stayed with them as long as twenty years. 

These Druids built great Temples and altars, open to the 
sky, fragments of some of which are yet remaining. Stone- 
henge, on Salisbury Plain, in Wiltshire, is the most extraor- 
dinary of these. Three curious stones, called Kits Coty 
House, on Bluebell Hill, near Maidstone, in Kent, form 
another. We know, from examination of the great blocks 
of which such buildings are made, that they could not have 
been raised without the aid of some ingenious machines, 
which are common now, but which the ancient Britons cer- 
tainly did not use in making their own uncomfortable 
houses. I should not wonder if the Druids, and their pupils 
who stayed with them twenty years, knowing more than 
the rest of the Britons, kept the people out of sight while 
they made these buildings, and then pretended that they 
built them by magic. Perhaps they had a hand in the for- 
tresses too; at all events, as they were very powerful, and 
very much believed in, and as they made and executed the 
laws, and paid no taxes, I don’t wonder that they liked 
their trade. And, as they persuaded the people the more 
Druids there were, the better off the people would be, I don’t 
wonder that there were a good many of them. But it is 
pleasant to think that there are no Druids, now, who go on 
in that way, and pretend to carry Enchanters’ Wands and 
Serpents’ Eggs — and of course there is nothing of the kind, 
anywhere.

Sack was the improved condition of the ancient Britons, 
fifty-live years before the birth of Our Saviour, when the 
Romans, under their great General, Julius Caesar, were 
masters of all the rest of the known world. Julius Caesar 
had then just conquered Gaul; and hearing, in Gaul, a good 
deal about the opposite Island with the white cliffs, and 
about the bravery of the Britons who inhabited it — some of 
whom had been fetched over to help the Gauls in the war 
against him — he resolved, as he was so near, to come and 
conquer Britain next. 

So, Julius Caesar came sailing over to this Island of ours, 
with eighty vessels and twelve thousand men. And he 
came from the French coast between Calais and Boulogne, 
“because thence was the shortest passage into Britain;” 
just for the same reason as our steam-boats now take the 
same track, every day. He expected to conquer Britain 
easily : but it was not such easy work as he supposed — for 
the bold Britons fought most bravely; and, what with not 
having his horse-soldiers with him (for they had been 
driven back by a storm), and what with having some of 
his vessels dashed to pieces by a high tide after they 
were drawn ashore, he ran great risk of being totally de- 
feated. However, for once that the bold Britons beat 
him, he beat them twice; though not so soundly but that 
he was very glad to accept their proposals of peace, and 
go away. 

But, in the spring of the next year, he came back; this 
time, with eight hundred vessels and thirty thousand men. 
The British tribes chose, as their general-in-chief, a Briton, 
whom the Romans in their Latin language called Cassivel- 
launus, but whose British name is supposed to have been 
Ca8wai«1jOn. A brave general he was, and well he and his 
soldiers fought the Roman army ! So well, that whenever 
in that war the Roman soldiers saw a great cloud of dust, 
and heard the rattle of the rapid British chariots, they 
trembled in their hearts. Besides a number of smaller bat- 
tles, there was a battle fought near Canterbury, in Kent; 
there was a battle fought near Chertsey, in Surrey; there 
was a battle fought near a marshy little town in a wood, 
the capital of that part of Britain which belonged to Cas- 
srvELLAUKUS, and which was probably near what is now 
Saint Albans, in Hertfordshire. However, brave Cassi- 
TiLLAUNua had the worst of it, on the whole; though he

and his men always fought like lions. As the other Brit- 
ish chiefs were jealous of him, and were always quarrelling 
with him, and with one another, he gave, up, and proposed 
peace. Julius Caesar was very glad to grant peaee easily, 
and to go away again with all his remaining ships and 
men. He had expected to find pearls ip Britain, and he 
may have found a few for anything I know; but, at all 
events, he found delicious oysters, aid I am sure he found 
tough Britons — of whom, I dare say, he made the same 
complaint as Napoleon Bonaparte the great French General 
did, eighteen hundred years afterwards, when he said they 
were such unreasonable fellows that they never knew when 
they were beaten. They never did know, I believe, and 
never will. 

Nearly a hundred years passed on, and all that time, 
there was peace in Britain. The Britons improved their 
towns and mode of life : became more civilised, travelled, 
ahd learnt a great deal from the Gauls and Romans. At 
last, the Roman Emperor, Claudius, sent Aulus PnAimus, 
a skilful general, with a mighty force, to subdue the Island, 
and shortly afterwards arrived himself. They did little; 
and Ostorius Scapula, another general, came. Some of 
the British Chiefs of Tribes submitted. Others resolved to 
fight to the death. Of these brave men, the bravest was 
Garactacus, or Caradoc, who gave battle to the Romans, 
with his army, among the mountains of North Wales. 
“ This day , n said he to his soldiers, “ decides the fate of 
Britain ! Your liberty, or your eternal slavery, dates from 
this hour. Remember your brave ancestors, who drove the 
great Caesar himself across the sea!” On hearing these 
words, his men, with a great shout, rushed upon the Ho- 
mans. But the strong Roman swords and armour were too 
much for the weaker British weapons in close conflict. 
The Britons lost the day. The wife and daughter of the 
brave Caraotacus were taken prisoners; his brothers deliv- 
ered themselves up; he himself was betrayed into the 
hands of the Romans by his false and base step-mother; 
and they carried him, and all his family, in triumph to 
Rome. 

Btft a great man will be great in misfortune, great in 
prison, great in chains. His noble air, and dignified en- 
durance of distress, so touched the Roman people who

restored to freedom. No one knows whether his great 
heart broke, and he died in Home, or whether he ever re* 
tamed to his own dear country. English oaks have grown 
ap from, acorns, and withered away, when they were hun- 
dreds of years old — and other oaks have sprung up in their 
places, and died too, very aged — since the rest of the his- 
tory of the brave Caractacus was forgotten. 

Still, the Britons would not yield. They rose again and 
again, and died by thousands, sword in hand. They rose, 
on every possible occasion. Suetonius, another Homan 
general, came, and stormed the Island of Anglesey (then 
called Mona), which was supposed to be sacred, and he 
burnt the Druids in their own wicker cages, by their own 
fires. But, even while he was in Britain, with his victori- 
ous troops, the Britons rose. Because Boadicea, a Brit- 
ish queen, the widow of the King of the Norfolk and Suf- 
folk people, resisted the plundering of her property by the 
Romans who were settled in England, she was scourged, by 
order of Catus a Homan officer; and her two daughters 
were shamefully insulted in her presence, and her husband's 
relations were made slaves. To avenge this injury, the 
Britons rose, with all their might and rage. They drove 
Catus into Gaul; they laid the Homan possessions waste; 
they forced the Homans out of London, then a poor little 
town, but a trading place; they hanged, burnt, crucified, 
and slew by the sword, seventy thousand Homans in a few 
dayB. Suetonius strengthened his army, and advanced to 
give them battle. They strengthened their army, and des- 
perately attacked his, on the held where it was strongly 
posted. Before the first charge of the Britons was made, 
Boadicea, in a war-chariot, with her fair hair streaming 
in the wind, and her injured daughters lying at her feet, 
drove among the troops, and cried to them for vengeance on 
their oppressors, the licentious Homans. The Britons 
| fought to the last; but they were vanquished with great 
slaughter, and the unhappy queen took poison. 

Still, the spirit of the Britons was not broken. When 
Suetonius left the country, they fell upon his troops, and 
retook the Island of Anglesey. Agricola came, fifteen or 
twenty years afterwards, and retook it once more, and de- 
voted seven years to subduing the country, especially that 
part of it which is now called Scotland; but, its people, 
the Caledonians, resisted him at every inch of ground*

They fought the bloodiest battles with him; they killed 
their very wives and children, to prevent his making pris- 
oners of them; they fell, fighting, in such great numbers 
that certain hills in Scotland are yet supposed to be vast 
heaps of stones piled up above their graves. Hadrian 
came, thirty years afterwards, and still they resisted him. 
Severus came, nearly a hundred years afterwards, and 
they worried his great army like dogs, and rejoiced to see 
them die, by thousands, in the bogs and swamps. Cara- 
calla, the son and successor of Severus, did the most to 
conquer them, for a time; but not by force of arms. He 
knew how little that would do. He yielded up a quantity 
of land to the Caledonians, and gave the Britons the same 
privileges as the Romans possessed. There was peace, after 
this, for seventy years. 

Then new enemies arose. They were the Saxons, a 
fierce, seafaring people from the countries to the North of 
the Rhine, the great river of Germany on the banks of 
which the best grapes grow to make the German wine. 
They began to come, in pirate ships, to the sea-coast of 
Gaul and Britain, and to plunder them. They were re- 
pulsed by Carausius, a native either of Belgium or of Brit- 
ain, who was appointed by the Romans to the command, 
and under whom the Britons first began to fight upon the 
sea. But, after this time, they renewed their ravages. A 
few years more, and the Scots (which was then the name 
for the people of Ireland), and the Piets, a northern peo- 
ple, began to make frequent plundering incursions into the 
South of Britain. All these attacks were repeated, at in- 
tervals, during two hundred years, and through a long suc- 
cession of Roman Emperors and chiefs; during all which 
length of time, the Britons rose against the Romans, over 
and over again. At last, in the days of the Roman Hono- 
rius, when the Roman power all over the world was fast 
declining, and when Rome wanted all her soldiers at home, 
the Romans abandoned all hope of conquering Britain, and 
went away. And still, at last, as at first, the Britons rose 
against them, in their old brave manner; for, a very little 
while before, they had turned away the Roman magistrates, 
and declared themselves an independent people. 

Five hundred years had passed, since Julius Caesar’s first 
invasion of the Island, when the Romans departed from it 
for ever. In the course of that time, although they had

been the cause of terrible fighting and bloodshed, they had 
done much to improve the condition of the Britons. They 
had made great military roads; they had built fOrts; they 
had taught them how to dress, and arm themselves, much 
better than they had ever known how to do before; they 
had refined the whole British way of living. Agrico:la 
had built a great wall of earth, more than seventy miles 
long, extending from Newcastle to beyond Carlisle, for the 
purpose of keeping out the Piets and Scots; Hadrian had 
strengthened it; Severus, finding it much in want of re- 
pair, had built it afresh of stone. Above all, it was in the 
Roman time, and by means of Roman ships, that the Chris- 
tian Religion was first brought into Britain, and its people 
first taught the great lesson that, to be good in the sight of 
God, they must love their neighbours as themselves, and 
do unto others as they would be done by. The Druids de- 
clared that it was very wicked to believe in any such thing, 
and cursed all the people who did believe it, very heartily. 
But, when the people found that they were none the better 
for the blessings of the Druids, and none the worse for 
the curses of the Druids, but, that the sun shone and the 
rain fell without consulting the Druids at all, they just be- 
gan to think that the Druids were mere men, and that it 
signified very little whether they cursed or blessed. After 
which, the pupils of the Druids fell off greatly in numbers, 
and the Druids took to other trades. 

Thus I haye come to the end of the Roman time in Eng- 
land. It is but little that is known of those five hundred 
years; but some remains of them are still found. Often, 
when labourers are digging up the ground, to make founda- 
tions for houses or churches, they light on rusty money that 
once belonged to the Romans. Fragments of plates from 
which they ate, of goblets from which they drank, and of 
pavement on which they trod, are discovered among the 
earth that is broken by the plough, or the dust that is 
crumbled by the gardener’ s spade . Wells that the Romans 
sunk, still yield water; roads that the Romans made, form 
part of our highways. In some old battle-fields, British 
spear-heads and Roman armour have been found, mingled 
together in decay, as they fell in the thick pressure of the 
fight. Traces of Roman camps overgrown with grass, and 
of mounds that are the burial-places of heaps of Britons, 
are to be seen in almost all parts of the country. Across

the bleak moors of Northumberland, the wall of Severus* 
overrun with moss and weeds, still stretches, a strong ruin; 
and the shepherds and their dogs lie sleeping on it in the 
summer weather. On Salisbury Plain, Stonehenge yet 
stands : a monument of the earlier time when the Roman 
name was unknown in Britain, and when the Druids, with 
their best magic wands, could not have written it in the 
sands of the wild sea-shore. 


CHAPTER II. 

ANCIENT ENGLAND UNDER THE EARLY SAXONS. 

The Romans had scarcely gone away from Britain, when 
the Britons began to wish they had never left it. For, 
the Roman soldiers being gone, and the Britons being 
much reduced in numbers by their long wars, the Piets 
and Scots came pouring in, over the broken and un- 
guarded wall of Severus, in swarms. They plundered the 
richest towns, and killed the people; and came back so 
often for more booty and more slaughter, that the unfortu- 
nate Britons lived a life of terror. As if the Piets and 
Scots were not bad enough on land, the Saxons attacked 
the islanders by sea; and, as if something more were still 
wanting to make them miserable, they quarrelled bitterly 
among themselves as to what prayers they ought to say, 
and how they ought to say them. The priests, being very 
angry with one another on these questions, cursed one an- 
other in the heartiest manner; and (uncommonly like the 
old Druids) cursed all the people whom they could not 
persuade. So, altogether, the Britons were very badly off, 
you may believe. 

They were in such distress, in short, that they sent a let- 
ter to Rome entreating help — whioh they called the Groans 
of the Britons; and in which they said, “The barbarians 
chase us into the sea, the sea throws us back upon the bar- 
barians, and we have only the hard choice left us of perish- 
ing by the sword, or perishing by the waves.” But, the 
Romans could not help them, even if they were so inclined; 
for they had enough to do to defend themselves against

U 


their own enemies, who were then very fierce and strong* 
At last, the Britons, unable to bear their hard condition 
any longer, resolved to make peace with the Saxons, and to 
invite the Saxons to come into their country, and help them 
to keep out the Piets and Scots. 

It was a British Prince named Vortigern who took this 
resolution, and who made a treaty of friendship with Hen- 
| gist and Horsa, two Saxon chiefs. Both of these names, 
in the old Saxon language, signify Horse; for the Saxons, 
like many other nations in a rough state, were fond of giv- 
ing men the names of animals, as Horse, Wolf, Bear, 
Hound. The Indians of North America, — a very inferior 
people to the Saxons, though — do the same to this day. 

Hengist and Horsa drove out the Piets and Soots; and 
Vortigern, being grateful to them for that service, made 
j no opposition to their settling themselves in that part of 
| England which is called the Isle of Thane t, or to their in- 
| viting over more of their countrymen to join them. But 
Hbngist had a beautiful daughter named Rowena; and 
when, at a feast, she filled a golden goblet to the brim with 
wine, and gave it to Vortigern, saying in a sweet voice, 
“ Dear King, thy health ! 99 the King fell in love with her. 
My opinion is, that the cunning Hengist meant him to do 
| so, in order that the Saxons might have greater influence 
l with him; and that the fair Rowena came to that feast, 
golden goblet and all, on purpose. 

At any rate, they were married; and, long afterwards, 
whenever the King was angry with the Saxons, or jealous 
of their encroachments, Rowena would put her beautiful 
! arms round his neck, and softly say, “ Dear King, they are 
my people ! Be favourable to them, as you loved that Sax- 
on girl who gave you the golden goblet of wine at the. feast ! ” 
And, really, I don’t see how the King could help himself. 

Ah! We must all die! In the course of years, Vorti- 
gern died — he was dethroned, and put in prison, first, I am 
afraid; and Rowena died; and generations of Saxons and 
Britons died; and events that happened during a long, long 
time, would have been quite forgotten but for the tales and 
Rong8 of the old Bards, who used to go about from feast 
j to feast, with their white beards, recounting the deeds of 
their forefathers. Among the histories of which they sang 
and talked, there was a famous one, concerning the bravery 
I and virtues of Kirto Artrur* supposed to hare been , a

British Prince in those old times. But, whether such a 
person really lived, or whether there were several persons 
whose histories came to be confused together under that one 
name, or whether all about him was invention, no one 
knows. 

I will tell you, shortly, what is the most interesting in 
the early Saxon times, as they are described in these songs 
and stories of the Bards. 

In, and long after, the days of Vortigern, fresh bodies 
of Saxons, under various chiefs, came pouring into Britain. 
One body, conquering the Britons in the East, and settling 
there, called their kingdom Essex; another body settled in 
the West, and called their kingdom Wessex; the Northfolk, 
or Norfolk people, established themselves in one place; 
the Southfolk, or Suffolk people, established themselves in 
another; and gradually seven kingdoms or states arose in 
England, which were called the Saxon Heptarchy. The 
poor Britons, falling back before these crowds of fighting 
men whom they had innocently invited over as friends, 
retired into Wales and the adjacent country; into Devon- 
shire, and into Cornwall. Those parts of England long re- 
mained unconquered. And in Cornwall now — where the 
sea-coast is very gloomy, steep, and rugged — where, in the 
dark winter-time, ships have often been wrecked close to 
the land, and every soul on board has perished — where 
the winds and waves howl drearily, and split the solid 
rocks into arches and caverns— there are very ancient 
ruins, which the people call the ruins of King Arthur’s 
Castle. 

Kent is the most famous of the seven Saxon kingdoms, 
because the Christian religion was preached to the Saxons 
there (who domineered over the Britons too much, to care 
for what they said about their religion, or anything else) by 
Augustine, a monk from Rome. King Ethelbbrt, of 
Kent, was soon converted; and the moment he said he was 
a Christian, his courtiers all said they were Christians; 
after which, ten thousand of his subjects said they were 
Christians too. Augustine built a little church, close to 
this King’s palace, on the ground now occupied by the 
beautiful cathedral of Canterbury. Sebert, the King’s 
nephew, built on a muddy marshy place near London, 
where there had been a temple to Apollo, a church dedi- 
cated to Saint Peter* which is now Westminster Abbey.

Aid, in London itself, on the foundation of a temple to 
Diana, he built another little church, which has risen up, 
since that old time, to be Saint PauPs. 

After the death of Ethelbert, Edwin, King of North- 
umbria, who was such a good king that it was said a wom- 
an or child might openly carry a purse of gold, in his reign, 
without fear, allowed his child to be baptised, and held a 
great council to consider whether he and his people should 
all be Christians or not. It was decided that thejj should 
be. Coifi, the chief priest of the old religion, made a 
great speech on the occasion. In this discourse, he told the 
people that he had found out the old gods to be impostors. 
“I am quite satisfied of it,” he said. “Look at me! I 
have been serving them all my life, and they have done 
nothing for me; whereas, if they had been really powerful, 
they could not have decently done less, in return for all I 
I have done for them, than make my fortune. As they have 
1 never made my fortune, I am quite convinced they are im- 
postors ! ” When this singular priest had finished speak- 
ing, he hastily armed himself with sword and lance, 
mounted a war-horse, rode at a furious gallop in sight of 
all the people to the temple, and flung his lance against it 
i as an insult. From that time, the Christian religion spread 
itself among the Saxons, and became their faith. 

The next very famous prince was Egbert. He lived 
about a hundred and fifty years afterwards, and claimed to 
have a better right to the throne of Wessex than Beortric, 
auother Saxon prince who was at the head of that kingdom, 
and who married Edburga, the daughter of Off a, king of 
another of the seven kingdoms. This Queen Edburga 
was a handsome murderess, who poisoned people when they 
offended her. One day, she mixed a cup of poison for a 
certain noble belonging to the court; but her husband 
drank of it too, by mistake, and died. Upon this, the peo- 
ple revolted, in great crowds; and running to the palace, 
and thundering at the gates, cried, “Down with the 
wicked queen, who poisons men ! ” They drove her out of 
the country, and abolished the title she had disgraced. 
When years had passed away, some travellers came home 
from Italy, and said that in the town of Pavia they had 
seen a ragged beggar-woman, who had once been handsome, 
hut was then shrivelled, bent, and yellow, wandering about 
the streets, crying for bread; and that this beggar-woman

was the poisoning English queen. It was, indeed, EdbuiJ 
ga; and so she died, without a shelter for her wretched 
head. 

Egbert, not considering himself safe in England, in eon* 
sequence of his having claimed the crown of Wessex (fo| 
he thought his rival might take him prisoner and put hist 
to death), sought refuge at the court of Charlemagne* 
King of France. On the death of Bbortbio, so unhappily 
poisoned by mistake, Egbert came back to Britain; suc- 
ceeded to the throne of Wessex; conquered some of the 
other monarchs of the seven kingdoms; added their territo- 
ries to his own; and, for the first time, called the country 
over which he ruled, England. 

And now, new enemies arose, who, for a long time, 
troubled England sorely. These were the Northmen, the 
people of Denmark and Norway, whom the English called 
the Danes. They were a warlike people, quite at home 
upon the sea; not Christiana; very daring and cruel. They 
came over in ships, and plundered and burned wheresoever 
they landed. Once, they beat Egbert in battle. Once, 
Egbert beat them. But, they cared no more for being 
beaten than the English themselves. In the four following 
short reigns, of Ethelwulf, and his sons, Ethelbalp, 
Ethelbert, and Ethelred, they came back, over and over 
again, burning and plundering, and laying England waste. 
In the last-mentioned reign, they seized Edmund, King of 
East England, and bound him to a tree. Then, they pro- 
posed to him that he should change his religion; but he, 
being a good Christian, steadily refused. Upon that, they 
beat him, made cowardly jests upon him, all defenceless as 
he was, shot arrows at him, and, finally, struck off his 
head. It is impossible to say whose head they might have 
struck off next, but for the death of King Ethelred from 
a wound he had received in fighting against them, and the 
succession to his throne of the best and wisest king that 
ever lived in England.

CHAPTER III. 

\ ENGLAND UNDER THE GOOD SAXON, ALFRED. 

1 Alfred the Great was a young man, three-and-twenty 
years of age, when he became king. Twice in his child- 
hood, he had been taken to Rome, where the Saxon nobles 
were in the habit of going on journeys which they supposed 

I to be religious; and, once, he had stayed for some time in 
Paris. Learning, however, was so little oared for, then, 
that at twelve years old he had not been taught to read; 
although, of thb sons of King Ethelwulf, he, the young- 
est, was the favourite. But he had — as most men who 
grow up to be great and good are generally found to have 
had — ah excellent mother; and , 1 one day, this lady, whose 
name was Osburga, happened, as she was sitting among 
her sons, to read a book of Saxon poetry. The art of 
printing was not known until long and long after that pe- 
riod, and the book, which was written, was what is called 
“ illuminated,” with beautiful bright letters, richly painted. 
The brothers admiring it very much, their mother said, “I 
will give it to that one of you four princes who first learns 
to read. ” Alfred sought out a tutor that very day, applied 
himself to learn with great diligence, and soon won the 
book. He was proud of it, all liis life. 

This great king, in the first year of his reign, fought nine 
battles with the Danes. : He made some treaties with them 
too, by which the fake Danes swore they would quit the 
country. They pretended to consider that they had taken 
a very solemn oath, in swearing this upon the holy brace- 
lets that they wore, and which were always buried with 
them when they died; but they cared little for it, for they 
thought nothing of breaking oaths and treaties too, as soon 
as it suited their purpose, and coming back again to fight, 
plunder, and bum, as usual. One fatal winter, iq the 
fourth year of King Alfred’s reign, they spread them- 
selves in great numbers over the whole of England; and so 
dispersed and routed the King’s soldiers that the King 
was left alone, and was obliged to disguise himself as a 
common peasant, and to take refuge in the cottage of one 
of his cowherds who did not know his face.

Here, King Alfred, while the Danes sought him far 
and near, was left alone one day, by the cowherd’s wife, 
to watch some cakes which she put to bake upon the hearth. 
But, being at work upon his bows and arrows, with which 
he hoped to punish the false Danes when a brighter time 
should come, and thinking deeply of his poor unhappy sub- 
jects whom the Danes chased through the land, his noble 
mind forgot the cakes, and they were burnt. “What!” 
said the cowherd’s wife, who scolded him weU when she 
came back, and little thought that she was scolding the 
King, “ you will be ready enough to eat them by-and-bye, 
and yet you cannot watch them, idle dog? ” 

At length, the Devonshire men made head against a new 
host of Danes who landed on their coast; killed their chief, 
and captured their flag; on which was represented the like- 
ness of a Raven — a very fit bird for a thievish army like 
that, I think. The loss of their standard troubled the 
Danes greatly, for they believed it to be enchanted — woven 
by the three daughters of one father in a single afternoon 
— and they had a story among themselves that when they 
were victorious in battle, the Raven stretched his wings 
and seemed to fly; and that when they were defeated, he 
would droop. He had good reason to droop, now, if he 
could have done anything half so sensible; for, King Al- 
fred joined the Devonshire men; made a camp with them 
on a piece of firm ground in the midst of a bog in Somerset- 
shire; and prepared for a great attempt for vengeance on 
the Danes, and the deliverance of his oppressed people. 

But, first, as it was important to know how numerous 
those pestilent Danes were, and how they were fortified. 
King Alfred, being a good musician, disguised himself 
as a glee-man or minstrel, and went, with his harp, to the 
Danish camp. He played and sang in the very tent of 
Guthrum the Danish leader, and entertained the Danes as 
they caroused. While he seemed to think of nothing but 
his music, he was watchful of their tents, their arms, their 
discipline, everything that he desired to know. And right 
soon did this great king entertain them to a different tune; 
for, summoning all his true followers to meet him at an 
appointed place, where they received him with joyful shouts 
and tears, as the monarch whom many of them had given 
up for lost or dead, he put himself at their head, marched 
on the Danish camp, defeated the Danes with great slaughr

ter, and besieged them for fourteen days to prevent their 
escape. But, being as merciful as he was good and brave, 
he then, instead of killing them, proposed peace : on con- 
dition that they should altogether depart from that West- 
ern part of England, and settle in the East; and that 
Guthrum should become a Christian, in remembrance of 
the Divine religion which now taught his conqueror, the 
noble Alfred, to forgive the enemy who had so often in- 
jured him. This, Guthrum did. At his baptism, King 
Alfred was his godfather. And Guthrum was an honour- 
able chief who well deserved that clemency; for, ever after- 
wards he was loyal and faithful to the king. The Danes 
under him were faithful too. They plundered and burned no 
more, but worked like honest men. They ploughed, and 
sowed, and reaped, and led good honest English lives. And I 
hope the children of those Danes played, many a time, with 
Saxon children in the sunny fields; and that Danish young 
men fell in love with Saxon girls, and married them; and 
that English travellers, benighted at the doors of Danish 
cottages, often went in for shelter until morning; and that 
Danes and Saxons sat by the red fire, friends, talking of 
King Afred the Great. 

All the Danes were not like these und£r Guthrum; for, 
after some years, more of them came over, in the old plun- 
dering and burning way — among them a fierce pirate of the 
name of Hastings, who had the boldness to sail up the 
Thames to Gravesend, with eighty ships. For three years 
there was a war with these Danes; and there was a famine 
in the country, too, and a plague, both upon human creat- 
ures and beasts. But King Alfred, whose mighty heart 
never failed him, built large ships nevertheless, with which 
to pursue the pirates on the sea; and he encouraged his sol- 
diers, by his brave example, to fight valiantly against them 
on the shore. At last, he drove them all away; and then 
there was repose in England. 

As great and good in peace, as he was great and good in 
war, King Alfred never rested from his labours to im- 
prove his people. He loved to talk with clever men, and 
with travellers from foreign countries, and to write down 
what they told him, for his people to read. He had stud- 
ied Latin after learning to read English, and now another 
of his labours was, to translate Latin books into the Eng- 
lish-Saxon tongue, that his people might be interested, and

improved by their contents. He made! jilst laws* that they 
might live more happily and, freely; he turned away all 
partial judges, that no wrong might be done them; hte wds 
so careful of their property* and punished robbers so se- 
verely, that it was a common thing, to Say that under the 
great King Alfred, garlands of golden ohairis and jewels 
might have hung across the streets, arid no man would 
have touched one. He founded schools; he patiently heard 
causes himself in his Court of Justice;* the great desires of 
his heart were, to do right to all his subjects, and to leave 
England better, wiser, happier in all ways, than he found 
it. His industry in these efforts was quite astonishing. 
Every day he divided into certain portions, and in each 
portion devoted himself to a certain pursuit. That he 
might divide his time exactly, he had wrix tordhes or can- 
dles made, which were all of the same size, WCre notched 
across at regular distances, and were always kept burning. 
Thus, as the candles burnt down, he divided the day into 
notches, almost as accurately as we now divide it into hours 
upon the clock* But when the candles were first invented, 
it was found that the wind arid draughts of air, blowing 
into the palace through the doors and windows*. and 
through the chinks in the walls* caused them to gutter and 
bum unequally. To prevent this* the King had them put 
into cases formed of wood and white horm And these were 
the first lanthorns ever made in England. 

All this time, he was afflicted with a terrible unknown 
disease, which caused him vidlent and frequent pain that 
nothing could relieve. He bote it, as he had borne all the 
troubles of his life, like a brave good man, until he was 
fifty-three years old; and then, having reigned thirty years, 
he died. He, died in the year nine, hundred and one; but, 
long ago as that is, his fame, and the love and . gratitude 
with which his subjects regarded him, are freshLy remem- 
bered to the present hour. 

In the next reign, which was the reign of Edward, dur- 
named The Elder, who Was chosen in council to succeed, 
a nephew of King Alfred troubled the coiintry by trying 
to obtain the throne. The Danes in the East of England 
took part with this usurper (perhaps because they had hon- 
oured his uncle so much, and honoured him foi* his Uncle’s 
sake), and there was hard fighting; but, the King* with 
the assistance of his sister, gained the day, and reigned in

peace for four and twenty years. He gradually extended 
his power over the whole of England, and so the Seven 
Kingdoms were united into one. 

When England thus became one kingdpm, ruled over by 
one Saxon king, the Saxons had been settled in the country 
more than four hundred and fifty years. Great changes 
had taken place in its customs during that thus* The Sax- 
ons were still greedy eaters and great drinkers, and then- 
feasts were often of a noisy and drunken kind} but many 
new comforts and even elegancies had become known, and 
were fast increasing. Hangings for the walls of rooms, 
where, in these modern days, we paste np paper, are known 
to have been sometimes made of silk, qrnamented with 
birds and flowers in needlework. Tables and chairs were 
curiously carved in different woods ; were sometimes deco- 
rated with gold or silver; sometimes eyen made of those 
precious metals. Knives and spoons were used at table; 
golden ornaments were. worn — with silk and cloth, and 
golden tissues and embroideries; dishes were made of gold 
and silver, brass and bone, There were varieties of drink- 
ing-horns, bedsteads, musical instruments. A harp was 
passed round, at a feast, like .the drinking-bowk from 
guest to. guest; andeabh one usually sang or played when 
his turn came. The weapons of the Saxons were Stputly 
made, and among them was a terrible iron hammer that 
gave deadly blows, and was long remembered. The Saxons 
themselves were a handsome people. The men were proud 
of their long fair hai}*, p^j-ted on the forehead; their ample 
beards, their fresn complexions, and clear eyes. The 
beauty of the Sftxpn w 0 ? 11 ® 1 ! filled England with a new 
delight and grace. 

I have more to tell of the Saxons yet, but I stop to say 
this now, because under the Gbeat Alfred, all the best 
points of the Engliph-Saxon character were first encouraged, 
and in him first shown. It has been the greatest character 
among the nations pf the earth. Wherever the descendants 
of the. Saxon race have gone, have sailed, or otherwise 
made their way, even to the remotest regions of the world, 
they have been patient, persevering, never to be broken in 
spirit, uever to be turned aside from enterprises qn which 
they have resolved. In Europe, Asia, Africa, America,

melts; the Saxon blood remains unchanged. Wheresoever 
that race goes, there, law and industry, and safety for life 
and property, and all the great results of steady persever- 
ance, are certain to arise. 

I pause to think with admiration, of the noble king who, 
in his single person, possessed all the Saxon virtues. 
Whom misfortune could not subdue, whom prosperity could 
not spoil, whose perseverance nothing could shake. Who 
was hopeful in defeat, and generous in success. Who loved 
justice, freedom, truth, and knowledge. Who, in his care 
to instruct his people, probably did more to preserve the 
beautiful old Saxon language, than I can imagine. With- 
out whom, the English tongue in which I tell this story 
might have wanted half its meaning. As it is said that his 
spirit still inspires some of our best English laws, so, let 
you and I pray that it may animate our English hearts, at 
least to this — to resolve, when we see any of our fellow- 
creatures left in ignorance, that we will do our best, while 
life is in us, to have them taught; and to tell those rulers 
whose duty it is to teach them, and who neglect their duty, 
that they have profited very little by all the years that 
have rolled away since the year nine hundred and one, and 
that they are far behind the bright example of Kino Al- 
fred the Great. 


CHAPTER IV. 

ENGLAND UNDER ATHELSTAN AND THE SIX BOY- 
KINGS. 

Athelstan, the son of Edward the Elder, succeeded 
that king. He reigned only fifteen years; but he remem- 
bered the glory of his grandfather, the great Alfred, and 
governed England well. He reduced the turbulent people 
of Wales, and obliged them to pay him a tribute in money, 
and in cattle, and to send him their best hawks and hounds. 
He was victorious over the Cornish men, who were not yet 
quiet under the Saxon government. He restored such of 
the old laws as were good, and had fallen into disuse; made 
some wise new laws, and took care of the poor and weak. 
A strong alliance, made against him by Anlaf a Danish

Prince, Constantine King of the Scots, and the people 
North Wales, he broke and defeated in one great battle, 
long famous for the vast numbers slain in it. After that, 
he had a quiet reign; the lords and ladies about him had 
leisure to become polite and agreeable; and foreign princes 
were glad (as they have sometimes been since) to come to 
England on visits to the English court. 

When Athelstan died, at forty-seven years old, his 
brother Edmund, who was only eighteen, became king. 
He was the first of six boy-kings, as you will presently 
know. 

They called him the Magnificent, because he showed a 
taste for improvement and refinement. But he was beset 
by the Danes, and had a short and troubled reign, which 
came to a troubled end. One night, when he was feasting 
in his hall, and had eaten much and drunk deep, he saw, 
among the company, a noted robber named Leof, who had 
been banished from England. Made very angry by the 
boldness of this man, the King turned to his cup-bearer, 
and said, “ There is a robber sitting at the table yonder, 
who, for his crimes, is an outlaw in the land — a hunted 
wolf, whose life any man may take, at any time. Com- 
mand that robber to depart ! ” “ I will not depart ! ” said 

Leof. “No? ” cried the King. “ No, by the Lord! ” said 
Leof. Upon that the King rose from his seat, and, mak- 
ing passionately at the robber, and seizing him by his long 
hair, tried to throw him down. But the robber had a dag- 
ger underneath his cloak, and, in the scuffle, stabbed the 
King to death. That done, he set his back against the 
wall, and fought so desperately, that although he was soon 
cut to pieces by the King’s armed men, and the wall and 
pavement were splashed with his blood, yet it was not be- 
fore he had killed and wounded many of them. You may 
imagine what rough lives the kings of those times led, 
when one of them could struggle, half drunk, with a public 
robber in his own dining-hall, and be stabbed in presence 
of the company who ate and drank with him. 

Then succeeded the boy-king Edred, who was weak and 
sickly in body, but of a strong mind. And his armies 
fought the Northmen, the Danes, and Norwegians, or the 
Sea-Kings, as they were called, and beat them for the time. 
And, in nine years, Edred died, and passed away. 

Then came the boy-king Edwy, fifteen years of age; but

the teal king, Who had the real powfer> was a monk named 
Dunstan — a clever priest, a little mad, and not a little 
proud and cruel. 

DuustUn was then Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, whither 
the body of King Edmund the Magnificent was carried, to 
be buried* While yet a boy, he had got out of his bed one 
night (being then in a fever), arid w'alked about Glaston- 
bury Church when it was under repair* and, because he 
did not tumble off sorrie scaffolds that Were there, and break 
his neck, it was reported that he had been shown over the 
building by an angel. He had also made a harp that was 
said to play of itself — which it very likely did, as ASolian 
Harps, which are played by the wind, and are understood 
now, always do* For these wonders he had been once de- 
nounced by his enemies, who Were jealous of his favour 
with the late King Athelstan, as a magician; and he had 
been waylaid, . bound hand and foot, and thrown into a 
marsh. But he got out again, somehow, to oause a great 
deal of trouble yet. 

The priests of those days were, generally, the only schol- 
ars. They were learned in many things; Having to make 
their own convents and irionasteries on uncultivated grounds 
that were granted to thein by the Crown, it was necessary 
tli at they should be good farmers and good gardeners, or 
their lands would have been too poor to support them. For 
the decoration of the chapels where they prayed, and for 
the eontfort of the refectories where they ate and drank, it 
was necessary that there should be good carpenters, good 
smiths, good painters, among them. For their greater 
safety in sickness and accident, living alone by themselves 
in solitary places, it was necessary that they should study 
the virtues of plants and herbs, arid should know how to 
dress cuts, bums, scalds, and bruises, and hoW to set bro- 
ken limbs* Accordingly, they taught themselves, and one 
another, a great variety of useful arts; and became skilful 
in agriculture, medicine, surgery, .and handicraft. And 
when they wanted the aid of any little piece of machinery, 
which would be simple enough now, but Was marvellous 
then, to impose a trick upon the pot>r peasants, they knew 
very well how to make it; and did make it many a time 
and often, I have no doubt. 

Dunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, was one of the 
tnost sagacious of these monks* He was an ingenious smith,

and worked at a forge in a little cell. This cell was made 
too short to admit of his lying at full length when he went 
to sleep — as if that did any good to anybody l — and he used 
to tell the most extraordinary lies about demons and spir- 
its, who, he said, came there to persecute him. For in- 
stance, he related that one day when he was at work, the 
devil looked in at the little window* and tried to tempt him 
to lead a life of idle pleasure; whereupon, having his pin- 
cers in the fire, red hot, he seized the devil by the nose, 
and put him to such pain, that his bellowings were heard 
for miles and miles. Some people are inclined to think this 
nonsense a part of Dunstan’s madness (for his head never 
quite recovered the fever), but I think not. I observe that 
it induced the ignorant people to consider him a holy man, 
and that it made him very powerful. Which was exactly 
what he always wanted. 

On the day of the coronation of the handsome boy -king 
Edwy, it was remarked by Odo, Archbishop of Canterbury 
(who was a Dane by birth), that the King quietly left the 
coronation feast, while all the oompany were there. Odo, 
much displeased, sent his friend Dunstan to seek him. 
Dunstan finding him in the oompany of his beautiful young 
wife Elgiva, and her mother Ethelgiva, a good and vir- 
tuous lady, not only grossly abused them, but dragged the 
young King back into the feasting-hall by force. Some, 
again, think Dunstan did this because the young King’s 
fair wife was his own cousin, and the monks objected to 
people marrying their own cousins; but I believe he did it, 
because he was an imperious, audacious, ill-conditioned 
priest, who, having loved a young lady himself before he 
became a sour monk, hated all love now, and everything 
belonging to it. 

The young King was quite old enough to feel this insult. 
Dunstan had been Treasurer in the last reign, and he soon 
charged Dunstan With having taken some of the last king’s 
money. The Glastonbury Abbot fled to Belgium ( very nar- 
rowly escaping some pursuers who were sent to put out his 
eyes, as you will wish they had, when you read what fol- 
lows), and his abbey was given to priests who were mar- 
ried; whom he always, both before and afterwards, op- 
posed. But he quickly conspired with his friend, Odo the 
Dane, to set up the King’s young brother, Edgar, as his 
rival for the throne; and, not content with this revenge.

he caused the beautiful queen Elgiva, though a lovely girl 
of only seventeen or eighteen, to be stolen from one of the 
Royal Palaces, branded in the cheek with a red-hot iron, 
and sold into slavery in Ireland. But the Irish people 
pitied and befriended her; and they said, “ Let us restore 
the girl-queen to the boy-king, and make the young lovers 
happy ! ” and they cured her of her cruel wound, and sent 
her home as beautiful as before. . But the villain Dunstan, 
and that other villain, Odo, caused her to be waylaid at 
Gloucester as she was joyfully hurrying to join her hus- 
band, and to be hacked and hewn with swords, and to be 
barbarously maimed and lamed, and left to die. When 
Edwy the Fair (his people called him so, because he was so 
young and handsome) heard of her dreadful fate, he died 
of a broken heart; and so the pitiful story of the poor 
young wife and husband ends! Ah! Better to be two 
cottagers in these better times, than king and queen of 
England in those bad days, though never so fair ! 

Then came the boy-king, Edgar, called the Peaceful, 
fifteen years old. Dunstan, being still the real king, drove 
all married priests out of the monasteries and abbeys, and 
replaced them by solitary monks like himself, of the rigid 
order called the Benedictines. He made himself Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury, for his greater glory; and exercised 
such power over the neighbouring British princes, and so 
collected them about the King, that once, when the King 
held his court at Chester, and went on the river Dee to visit 
the monastery of St. John, the eight oars of his boat were 
pulled (as the people used to delight in relating in stories 
and songs) by eight crowned kings, and steered by the King 
of England. As Edgar was very obedient to Dunstan and 
the monks, they took great pains to represent him as the 
best of kings. But he was really profligate, debauched, 
and vicious. He once forcibly carried off a young lady 
from the convent at Wilton; and Dunstan, pretending to 
be very much shocked, condemned him not to wear his 
crown upon his head for seven years — no great punishment, 
I dare say, as it can hardly have been a more comfortable 
ornament to wear, than a stewpan without a handle. His 
marriage with his second wife, Elfrida, is one of the worst 
events of his reign. Hearing of the beauty of tills lady, he 
despatched his favourite courtier, A th el wold, to her 
father’s castle in Devonshire, to see if she were really as

charming as fame reported. Now, she was so exceedingly 
beautiful that Athelwold fell in love with her himself, and 
married her; but he told the King that she was only rich 
— not handsome. The King, suspecting the truth when 
they came home, resolved to pay the newly-married couple 
a visit; and, suddenly, told Athelwold to prepare for his 
immediate coming. Athelwold, terrified, confessed to his 
young wife what he had said and done, and implored her 
to disguise her beauty by some ugly dress or silly manner, 
that he might be safe from the King* s anger. She promised 
that she would; but she was a proud woman, who would 
far rather have been a queen than the wife of a courtier. 
She dressed herself in her best dress, and adorned herself 
with her richest jewels; and when the King came, pres- 
ently, he discovered the cheat. So, he caused his false 
friend, Athelwold, to be murdered in a wood, and married 
his widow, this bad Elfrida. Six or seven years after- 
wards, he died; and was buried, as if he had been all that 
the monks said he was, in the abbey of Glastonbury, which 
he — or Dunstan for him — had much enriched. 

England, in one part of this reign, was so troubled by 
wolves, which, driven out of the open country, hid them- 
selves in the mountains of Wales when they were not attack- 
ing travellers and animals, that the tribute payable by the 
Welsh people was forgiven them, on condition of their pro- 
ducing, every year, three hundred wolves* heads. And the 
Welshmen were so sharp upon the wolves, to save their 
money, that in four years there was not a wolf left. 

Then came the boy-king, Edward, called the Martyr, 
from the manner of his death. Elfrida had a son, named 
Ethelred, for whom she claimed the throne; but Dunstan 
did not choose to favour him, and he made Edward king* 
The boy was hunting, one day, down in Dorsetshire, when 
he rode near to Corfe Castle, where Elfrida and Ethelred 
lived. Wishing to see them kindly, he rode away from his 
attendants and galloped to the castle gate, where he ar- 
rived at twilight, and blew his hunting-horn. “ You are 
welcome, dear King,” said Elfrida, coming out, with her 
brightest smiles. “ Pray you dismount and enter.” “ Not 
so, dear madam,” said the King. “ My company will miss 
me, and fear that I have met with some harm. Please you 
to give me a cup of wine, that I may drink here, in the 
saddle, to you and to my little brother, and so ride away

with the good speed I have made in riding here. ” Elfrida, 
going in to bring the wine, whispered an armed servant, 
one of her attendants, who stole out of the darkening gate- 
way, and crept round behind the King’s horse. As the 
King raised the cUp to his lips, saying, “ Health! " to the 
wicked woman who was smiling on hiin, and to his inno- 
cent . brother whose hand she held in hers, and who was 
only ten years old, this armed man made a spring and 
stabbed him in the back. He dropped the dup and spurred 
his horse away;, but, soon fainting with loss of blood, 
drooped from the saddle, and, in his fall, entangled One of 
his feet in the stirrup. The frightened hdrse dashed on; 
trailing his rider's curls upon the ground; dragging his 
smooth young faee through ruts, and stones, and briers, 
and. fallen leaves, and mud; until the hunters, tracking the 
animal's Course, by the King’s blood, oaughthis bridle, and 
released the disfigured body. 

Then came the sixth and last of the boy-kings, Ethel- 
red, whom Elfrida^ when he cried out at the sight of his 
murdered brother riding away from the castle gate, unmer- 
cifully beat with a torch which she snatched from One of 
the attendants. The people so disliked this boy, on account 
of his cruel mother tod the murder she had done to promote 
him, that Dunstan would not have had him for king, but 
would have made Edgitha, the daughter of the dead King 
Edgar, and of tire lady whom he stole out of the convent at 
Wilton, Queen of England, if she would have consented. 
But she knew the stories of the youthful kings too well, 
and would not be persuaded from the convent where she 
lived in peace; so, Dunstan put Ethelred on the throne, 
having no one else to put there, and gave him the niekname 
of The Unrbadt — knowing that he wanted resolution and 
firmness. 

At first, Elfrida possessed great influence over the young 
King, but, as he grew older and came of age, her influence 
declined* The infamous woman, not having it in her 
power to do any more evil, then retired from oourt, tod, 
according to the fashion of the time, built churches and 
monasteries, to expiate her guilt. As if a church, with a 
steeple reaching to the very stars, would have been any 
sign of true repentance for the blood of the poor boy, whose 
murdered form was trailed at his horse’s heels! As if she 
could have buried her wiokedness beneath the senseless

stones of the whole world, piled up one upon another, for 
the monks to live in ! 

About the ninth or tenth year of this reign, Dunstan 
died. He was growing old then, but was as stem and art- 
ful as ever. Two circumstances that happened in connec- 
tion with him, in this reign of Ethelred, made a great noise. 
Once, he was present at A meeting of the Church, when the 
question was discussed whether priests should have per- 
mission to marry ; and, as he sat with his head hung down, 
apparently (thinking about it, a voice seemed to come out 
of a crucifix in the room, and warn the meeting to be of his 
opinion. This was some juggling qf Dunstan’ s, and was 
probably his own voice disguised. But he played off a 
worse juggle than that, Soon afterwards; for, another 
meeting being held on the same subject, and he and his 
supporters being seated pn one side of a great room, and 
their opponents on the other, he rose and said, “ To Christ 
Himself, as Judge, do I commit this pause ! ” Immediately 
on these words being spoken, the floor where the opposite 
party sat gave way, and some weaoi killed and many 
wounded. You may be pretty sure that it had been weak^ 
ened under Dunstan’ s direction, and that it fell at Dun- 
stan’s signal. Ilis part of the floor did not go down. No, 
no. He was too good a workman for that. 

When he died, the monks settled that he was a Saint, 
and called him Saint Dunstan ever afterwards. They 
might just as well have settled that he was a coach-horse, 
and could just as easily have called him one. 

Ethelred the Unready was glad enough, I dam say, to 
be rid of this holy saint; but, left to himself, he was a 
poor weak king, and his rejgn was a reign of defeat and 
shame. The, restless Danes, led by.SwnvN, a son of the 
King of Denmark who had quarrelled with bis father and 
had been banished from home, again came into England, 
and, year after year, attacked and despoiled large towns. 
To coax these sea-kings away, the weak Ethelred paid them 
money; but, the more money he paid, the mom money the 
Danes wanted. At first, he gave them ten thousand 
pounds; on their next invasion, sixteen thousand pounds; 
on their next invasion, four and twenty thousand' pounds; 
to pay which large sums,, the : unfortunate English people 
were heavily taxed* But, as the Danes still came back 
and wanted more, he thought it would be. a gopd plan to

marry into some powerful foreign family that would help 
him with soldiers. So, in the year one thousand and two, 
he courted and married Emma, the sister of Richard Duke 
of Normandy; a lady who was called the Flower of Nor- 
mandy. 

And now, a terrible deed was done in England, the like 
of which was never done on English ground before or since. 
On the thirteenth of November, in pursuance of secret in- 
structions sent by the King over the whole country, the 
inhabitants of every town and city armed, and murdered 
all the Danes who were their neighbours. Young and old, 
babies and soldiers, men and women, every Dane was 
killed. No doubt there were among them many ferocious 
men who had done the English great wrong, and whose 
pride and insolence, in swaggering in the houses of the 
English and insulting their wives and daughters, had be- 
come unbearable; but no doubt there were also among 
them many peaceful Christian Danes who had married Eng- 
lish women and become like English men. They were all 
slain, even to Gunhilda, the sister of the King of Den- 
mark, married to an English lord; who was first obliged to 
see the murder of her husband and her child, and then was 
killed herself. 

When the King of the sea-kings heard of this deed of 
blood, he swore that he would have a great revenge. He 
raised an army, and a mightier fleet of ships than ever yet 
had sailed to England; and in all his army there was not a 
slave or an old man, but every soldier was a free man,' and 
the son of a free man, and in the prime of life, and sworn 
to be revenged upon the English nation, for the massacre 
of that dread thirteenth of November, when his country- 
men and countrywomen, and the little children whom they 
loved, were killed with fire and sword. And so, the sea- 
kings came to England in many great ships, each bearing 
the flag of its own commander. Golden eagles, ravens, 
dragons, dolphins, beasts of prey, threatened England 
from the prows of those ships, as they came onward 
through the water; and were reflected in the shining shields 
that hung upon their sides. The ship that bore the stand- 
ard of the King of the sea-kings was carved and painted 
like a mighty serpent; and the King in his anger prayed 
that the Gods in whom he trusted might all desert him, if 
his serpent did not strike its fangs into England’s heart.

And indeed it did. For, the great army landing from 
the great fleet, near Exeter, went forward, laying England 
waste, and striking their lances in the earth as they ad- 
vanced, or throwing them into rivers, in token of their mak- 
ing all the island theirs. In remembrance of the black 
November night when the Danes were murdered, whereso- 
ever the invaders came, they made the Saxons prepare and 
spread for them great feasts; and when they had eaten 
those feasts, and had drunk a curse to England with wild 
rejoicings, they drew their swords, and killed their Saxon 
entertainers, and marched on. For six long years they 
carried on this war : burning the crops, farmhouses, barns, 
mills, granaries; killing the labourers in the fields; pre- 
venting the seed from being sown in the ground; causing 
famine and starvation; leaving only heaps of ruin and 
smoking ashes, where they had found rich towns. To 
crown this misery, English officers and men deserted, and 
even the favourites of Ethelred the Unready, becoming 
traitors, seized many of the English ships, turned pirates 
against their own country, and aided by a storm occasioned 
the loss of nearly the whole English navy. 

There was but one man of note, at this miserable pass, 
who was true to his country and the feeble King. He was 
a priest, and a brave one. For twenty days, the Archbishop 
of Canterbury defended that city against its Danish besieg- 
ers; and when a traitor in the town threw the gates open 
and admitted them, he said, in chains, 44 1 will not buy my 
life with money that must be extorted from the suffering 
people. Do with me what you please ! ” Again and again, 
he steadily refused to purchase his release with gold wrung 
from the poor. 

At last, the Danes being tired of this, and being assem- 
bled at a drunken merrymaking, had him brought into the 
feasting-hall. 

44 Now, bishop,” they said, 44 we want gold ! ” 

He looked round on the crowd of angry faces : from the 
shaggy beards close to him, to the shaggy beards against 
the walls, where men were mounted on tables and forms to 
see him over the heads of others : and he dtnew that his 
time was come. 

44 1 have no gold,” said he. 

44 Get it, bishop ! ” they all thundered. 

44 That, I have often told you I will not,” said he.

They gathered closer round him, threatening, but he 
Stood unmoved. Then, one man struck him; then, another; 
then a cursing soldier picked up from a heap in a corner of 
the hall, where fragments had been rudely thrown at din- 
ner, a great ox-bone, and cast it at his face* frOm which 
the blood came spurting forth ; then, others ran to the same 
heap, and knocked him down with other bones, and bruised 
and battered him; until one soldier whom he had baptised 
(willing, as I hope for the sake of that soldiers soul, to 
shorten the sufferings of the good man) struck him dead 
with his battle-axe. 

If Ethelred had had the heart to emulate the courage of 
this noble archbishop, he might have done something yet. 
Biit he paid the Danes forty-eight thousand pounds, in- 
stead, and gained so little by the cowardly act, that Sweyn 
soon afterwards came over to Subdue all EUgland. So 
broken was the attachment of the English people, by this 
time, to their incapable King and their forlorn Country 
which could not protect them, that they welcomed Sweyn 
on all sides, as a deliverer. London faithfully stood out, 
as long as the King was within its walls; but, when he 
sneaked away, it also welcomed the Dane. Then, all was 
over; and the King took refuge abroad with the Duke of 
Normandy, who had already given shelter to the King’s 
wife, once the Flower of that coiin try, and to her children. 

Still, the English people, in spite of their sad sufferings, 
could not quite forget the great King Alfred and the Saxon 
race. When Sweyn died suddenly, in little more than a 
month after he had been proclaimed King of England, they 
generously sent to Ethelred, to say that they would have 
him for their King again, “ if he would only govern them 
better than he had governed them before.” The Unready, 
instead of coming hiihself, sent Edward, ohe of his Sons, 
to make promises for him. At last, he followed, arid the 
English declared him King. The Danes declared Canute, 
the son of Sweyn, King. Thus, direful war began again, 
and lasted for three years, when the Unready died. Arid 
I know of nothing better that he did, in all his feign of 
eight and thirty years. 

Was Canute to be King now? Not over the Saxons, 
they said; they must have Edmund, one! of the sons of the 
Unready, who was sumamed Ironside, beohuse of his 
strength and stature. Edmund and Canute thereupon fell

fighting-ground it was— and then Ironside, who was a big 
man, proposed to Canute, who was a little man, that they 
two should fight it out in single combat. If Canute had 
been the big man, he Would probably have said yes, but, 
being the little man, he decidedly said no. However, he 
declared that he was willing to divide the kingdom — to 
take all that lay north Of Watling Street, as the old Roman 
military road from Dover to Chester was called, and to give 
Ironside all that lay south of it. Most men being weary 
of so much bloodshed, this was done. But Canute soon 
became sole King of England; for Ironside died suddenly 
within two months. Some think that he was killed, and 
killed by Canute’s orders. No one knows. 


CHAPTER V. 

ENGLAND UNDER CANUTE THE DANE. 

Canute reigned eighteen years* He was a merciless 
King at first. After he had clasped the hands of the Sax- 
on chiefs, in token of the sincerity with which he swore to 
be just and good to them in return for their acknowledg- 
ing him, he denounced and Slew many of them, as well as 
many relations of the late King* “ He who brings me the 
head of one of my enemies,” he used to say, “shall be 
dearer to me than a brother.” And he was so severe in 
hunting down his enemies, that he must have got together 
a pretty large family of these dear brothers. He was 
strongly inclined to kill Edmund and Edward, two chil* 
dren, sons of poor Ironside; but, being afraid to do so, in 
England, he sent them over to the King of Sweden, with a 
request that the King would be so good as “dispose of 
them.” If the King of Sweden had been like many, many 
other men of that day, he would have had their innocent 
throats cut; but he was a kind man, and brought them up 
tenderly. 

Normandy ran much in Canute’s mind. In Normandy 
were the two children of the late King — Edward and 
Alfred byname; and their uncle the Duke might one day

claim the crown for them. But the Duke showed so little 
inclination to do so now, that he proposed to Canute to 
marry his sister, the widow of The Unready; who, being 
but a showy flower, and caring for nothing so much as be- 
coming a queen again, left her children and was wedded to 
him. 

Successful and triumphant, assisted by the valour of the 
English in his foreign wars, and with little strife to trouble 
him at home, Canute had a prosperous reign, and made 
many improvements. He was a poet and a musician. He 
grew sorry, as he grew older, for the blood he had shed at 
first; and went to Rome in a Pilgrim’s dress, by way of 
washing it out. He gave a great deal of money to foreign- 
ers on his journey; but he took it from the English before 
he started. On the whole, however, he certainly became a 
far better man when he had no opposition to contend with, 
and was as great a King as England had known for some 
time. 

The old writers of history relate how that Canute was 
one day disgusted with his courtiers for their flattery, and 
how he caused his chair to be set on the sea-shore, and 
feigned to command the tide as it came up not to wet the 
edge of his robe, for the land was his; how the tide came 
up, of course, without regarding him; and how he then 
turned to his flatterers, and rebuked them, saying, what 
was the might of any earthly king, to the might of the 
Creator, who could say unto the sea, " Thus far shalt thou 
go, and no farther ! ” We may learn from this, I think, 
that a little sense will go zt long way in a king; and that 
courtiers are not easily cured of flattery, nor kings of a 
liking for it. If the courtiers of Canute had not known, 
long before, that the King was fond of flattery, they would 
have known better than to offer it in such large doses. 
And if they had not known that he was vain of this speech 
(anything but a wonderful speech it seems to me, if a good 
child had made it), they would not have been at such great 
pains to repeat it. I fancy I see them all on the sea-shore 
together; the King’s chair sinking in the sand; the King 
in a mighty good humour with his own wisdom; and the 
courtiers pretending to be quite stunned by it ! 

It is not the sea alone that is bidden to go "thus far, and 
no farther.” The great command goes forth to all the 
kings upon the earth, and went to Canute in the year one

thousand and thirty-five, and stretched him dead upon his 
bed. Beside it, stood his Norman wife. Perhaps, as the 
King looked his last upon her, he, who had so often thought 
distrustfully of Normandy, long ago, thought once more of 
the two exiled Princes in their uncle’s court, and of the 
little favour they could feel for either Danes or Saxons, 
and of a rising cloud in Normandy that slowly moved 
towards England. 


CHAPTER VI. 

ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD HAREFOOT, HARDICA- 
NUTE, AND EDWARD THE CONFESSOR. 

Canute left three sons, by name Sweyn, Harold, and 
Hardicanute; but his Queen, Emma, once the Flower of 
Normandy, was the mother of only Hardicanute. Canute 
had wished his dominions to be divided between the three,- 
and had wished Harold to have England; but the Saxon 
people in the South of England, headed by a nobleman 
with great possessions, called the powerful Earl Godwin 
(who is said to have been originally a poor cow-boy), op- 
posed this, and desired to have, instead, either Hardica- 
nute, or one of the two exiled Princes who were over in 
Normandy. It seemed so certain that there would be more- 
bloodshed to settle this dispute, that many people left their 
homes, and took refuge in the woods and swamps. Hap- 
pily, however, it was agreed to refer the whole question to 
a great meeting at Oxford, which decided that Harold 
should have all the country north of the Thames, with Lon- 
don for his capital city, and that Hardicanute should have 
all the south. The quarrel was so arranged; and, as Har- 
dicanute was in Denmark troubling himself very little 
about anything but eating and getting drunk, his mother 
and Earl Godwin governed the south for him. 

They had hardly begun to do so, and the trembling peo- 
ple who had hidden themselves were scarcely at home again, 
when Edward, the elder of the two exiled Princes, came 
over from Normandy with a few followers, to claim the 
English Crown. His mother Emma, however, who only 
cared for her last son Hardicanute, instead of assisting

him, as he expected, opposed him so strongly with all her 
influence that he was very soon glad ibo get safely back. 
His brother Alfred was not so fortunate. Believing in an 
affectionate letter, written some time afterwards to him and 
his brother, in his mother’s name (but whether really with 
or without his mother’s knowledge is now uncertain), he 
allowed himself to ba tempted over to England, with a 
good force of soldiers, and landing on the Kentish coast, 
and being met and welcomed by Earl Godwin, proceeded 
into Surrey, as far as the town of Guildford. Here, he and 
his men halted in the evening to rest, having still the Earl 
in their company ; who * had peered lodgings and good 
cheer for them. But, in the dead of the night, when they 
were off their guard, being divided into small parties sleep- 
ing soundly after a long march and a plentiful supper in 
different houses, they were set upon by the King’s troops, 
and taken prisoners. Next morning they were drawn out 
in a line, to the number of six hundred men, and were bar- 
barously tortured and killed ; with the exception of every 
tenth man, who was sold into slavery. As to the wretched 
Prince Alfred, he was stripped naked, tied to a horse and 
sent away into the Isle of Ely, where his eyes were torn 
out of his head, and where in a few days he miserably died. 
I am not sure that the Earl had wilfully entrapped him, 
but I suspect it strongly. 

Harold was now King all over England, though it is 
doubtful whether the Archbishop of Canterbury (the greater 
part of the priests were Saxons, and not friendly to the 
Danes) ever consented to crown him. Crowned or un- 
crowned, with the Archbishop’s leave or without it, he was 
King for four years s after which short reign he died, and 
was buried ; having never done much in life but go a hunting. 
He was such a fast runner at this, his favourite sport, that 
the people called him Harold Harefoot. 

Hardicanuie was then at Bruges, in Flanders, plotting, 
with his mother (who had gone over there after the cruel 
murder of Prince Alfred), for the invasion of England. 
The Danes and Saxons, finding themselves without a King, 
and dreading new disputes, made common cause, and joined 
in inviting him to occupy the Throne. He consented, and 
soon troubled them enough ; for he brought over numbers 
of Danes, and taxed the people so insupportably to enrich 
tfiose greedy favourites that there were many insurrectional

especially one at Worcester, where the citizens rose and 
killed his tax-collectors 5 in reVenge for which he burned 
their city. He was a brutaLKing, whose first public act 
was to order the dead body of podr Harold Harefoot to be 
dug up, beheaded, and thrown into the river. His end was 
worthy of sdch a beginning. He fell down drunk, with a 
goblet of wine in his hand, at a wedding-feast at Lambeth, 

I given in honour of the marriage of his standard-bearer, a 
Dane named Towed the Proud. And he never spoke 
! again. 

| Edward, afterwards called by the monks The Cojtfessor, 

succeeded 5 hnd his first act was to oblige his toother Emma, 
who had favoured him do little, to retire into the country ; 
where she died some ten ydars afterwards. He was the 
exiled prince whose brother Alfred had been sd foully 
killed. He had been invited over from Nbrmandy by Har- 
dicanute, iii the course of his Short reign of two years, aiid 
had been handsomely treated at court* His dause was now 
favoured by the powerful Earl Godwin, and hei was soon 
made King. This Earl had been suspected by the people, 
ever since Prince Alfred’s cruel death; he had even been 
tried in the last reign for* the Prince’ s murder, hut had 
been pronounced not guilty; chiefly, as it was supposed, 
because of a present he had mhde to the swinish King, of 
a gilded ship with a figure-head of solid gold, and a ere# 
of eighty splendidly armed meii. It was his interest to 
help the new King with his power, if the new King would 
help him against the popular distrust and hatred. So they 
made a bargain. Edwatd the Confessor got the Throne* 

1 The Earl got more power and more land, and his daughter 
Editha was made queen 5 for it was a part of their compact 
that the King should take her fbr his wife* 

But, although she wets a gentle lady, in all things worthy 
to be beloved — good, beautiful, sensible, and kind — the 
King from the first neglected fieri. Her father and her si £ 
proud brothers, resenting this cold treatment, harassed the 
King greatly by exerting all their power, to make him un- 
popular. Having lived so long in Normandy, he preferred 
the Normans to the English. He made a Norman Arch- 
bishop, and Norman Bishops; his great officers and 
favourites Were all Normans; he introduced the Norman 
fashions and the Norman language; iii imitation of the 
state custom of Normandy, he attached a great seal to his

state documents, instead of merely marking them, as the 
Saxon Kings had done, with the sign of the cross — just as 
poor people who have never been taught to write, now 
make the same mark for their names. All this, the power- 
ful Earl Godwin and his six proud sons represented to the 
people as disfavour shown towards the English ; and thus 
they daily increased their own power, and daily diminished 
the power of the King. 

They were greatly helped by an event that occurred 
when he had reigned eight years. Eustace, Earl of Bou- 
logne, who had married the King’s sister, came to England 
on a visit. After staying at the court some time, he set 
forth, with his numerous train of attendants, to return 
home. They were to embark at Dover. Entering that 
peaceful town in armour, they took possession of the best 
houses, and noisily demanded to be lodged and entertained 
without payment. One of the bold men of Dover, who 
would not endure to have these domineering strangers jing- 
ling their heavy swords and iron corselets up and down his 
house, eating his meat, and drinking his strong liquor, 
stood in his doorway and refused admission to the first 
armed man who came there. The armed man drew, and 
wounded him. The man of Dover struck the armed man 
dead. Intelligence of what he had done, spreading through 
the streets to where the Count Eustace and his men were 
standing by their horses, bridle in hand, they passionately 
mounted, galloped to the house, surrounded it, forced their 
way in (the doors and windows being closed when they 
came up), and killed the man of Dover at his own fireside. 
They then clattered through the streets, cutting down and 
riding over men, women, and children. This did not last 
long, you may believe. The men of Dover set upon them 
with great fury, killed nineteen of the foreigners, wounded 
many more, and, blockading the road to the port so that 
they should not embark, beat them out of the town by the 
way they had come. Hereupon, Count Eustace rides as 
hard as man can ride to Gloucester, where Edward is, sur- 
rounded by Norm an monks and Norman lords. " Justice ! f} 
cries the Count, “ upon the men of Dover, who have set 
upon and slain my people ! ” The King sends immediately 
for the powerful Earl Godwin, who happens to be near; 
reminds him that Dover is under his government ; and or- 
ders him to repair to Dover and do military execution on

the inhabitants. “ It does not become you,” says the proud 
Earl in reply, “ to condemn without a hearing those whom 
you have sworn to protect. I will not do it.” 

The King, therefore, summoned the Earl, on pain of 
banishment and loss of his titles and property, to appear 
before the court to answer this disobedience. The Earl re- 
fused to appear. He, his eldest son Harold, aud his second 
son Sweyn, hastily raised as many fighting men as their 
utmost power could collect, and demanded to have Count 
Eustace and his followers surrendered to the justice of the 
country. The King, in his turn, refused to give them up, 
and raised a strong force. After some treaty and delay, 
the troops of the great Earl and his sons began to fall off. 
The Earl, with a part of his family and abundance of treas- 
ure, sailed to Flanders; Harold escaped to Ireland; and 
the power of the great family was for that time gone in 
England. But, the people did not forget them. 

Then, Edward the Confessor, with the true meanness of 
a mean spirit, visited his dislike of the once powerful father 
and sons upon the helpless daughter and sister, his unof- 
fending wife, whom all who saw her (her husband and 
his monks excepted) loved. He seized rapaciously upon 
her fortune and her jewels, and allowing her only one 
attendant, confined her in a gloomy convent, of which a 
sister of his — no doubt an unpleasant lady after his own 
heart — was abbess or jailer. 

Having got Earl Godwin and his six sons well out of his 
way, the King favoured the Normans more than ever. He 
invited over William, Duke of Normandy, the sou of 
that Duke who had received him. and his murdered brother 
long ago, and of a peasant girl, a tanner* s daughter, with 
whom that Duke had fallen in love for her beauty as he 
saw her washing clothes in a brook. William, who was a 
great warrior, with a passion for fine horses, dogs, aud 
arms, accepted the invitation ; and the Normans in Eng- 
land, finding themselves more numerous than ever when he 
arrived with his retinue, and held in still greater honour 
at court than before, became more aud more haughty tow- 
ards the people, and were more and more disliked by them. 

The old Earl Godwin, though he was abroad, knew well 
how the people felt ; for, with part of the treasure he had 
carried away with him, he kept spies and agents in his p^y 
all over England. Accordingly, he thought the time was

come for fitting oat a great expedition against the Norman* 
loving King. With it, he sailed to the Isle of Wight, 
where he was joined by his son Harold, the most gallant 
and brave of all his family. And so the father and son 
came sailing up the Thames to Southwark ; great numbers 
of the people declaring for them, and shouting for the Eng- 
lish Earl and the English Harold, against the Norman 
favourites ! 

The King was at first as blind and stubborn as kings usu- 
ally have been whensoever they have been in the hands of 
monks. But the people rallied so thickly round the old Earl 
and his son, and the old Earl was so steady in demanding 
without bloodshed the restoration of himself and his family 
to their rights, that at last the court took the alarm. The 
Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Norman Bishop 
of London, surrounded by their retainers, fought their way 
out of London, and escaped from Essex to France in a fish- 
ing-boat. The other Norman favourites dispersed in all 
directions. The old Earl and his sons (except Sweyn, who 
had committed crimes against the law) were restored to 
their possessions and dignities. Editha, the virtuous and 
lovely Queen of the insensible King, was triumphantly re- 
leased from her prison, the convent, and once more sat in 
her chair of state, arrayed in the jewels of which, when 
she had no champion to support her rights, her cold-blooded 
husband had deprived her. 

The old Earl Godwin did not long enjoy his restored 
fortune. He fell down in a fit at the King’s table, and 
died upon the third day afterwards. Harold succeeded to 
his power, and to a far higher place in the attachment of 
the people than his father had ever held. By his valour 
he subdued the King’s enemies in many bloody fights. He 
was vigorous against rebels in Scotland — this was the time 
when Macbeth slew Duncan, upon which event our English 
Shakespeare, hundreds of years afterwards, wrote his great 
tragedy ; and he killed the restless Welsh King Griffith, 
and brought his head to England. 

What Harold was doing at sea, when he was driven on 
the Flinch coast by a tempest, is not at all certain ; nor 
does it at all matter. That his ship was forced by a storm 
on that shore, and that he was taken prisoner, there is no 
doubt. In those barbarous days, all shipwrecked strangers 
were taken prisoners, and obliged to pay ransom* So, a

certain Count Guy,whowdsthe Lord of Ponthieu Where 
Harold’s disaster happened, seized him, instead of relief 
ing him like a hospitable and Christian lord as he ought 
to have done, and expected to make a very good thing 
of it. 

But Harold sent off immediately to Duke William of 
Normandy, complaining of this treatment ; and the Duke 
| no sooner heard of it than he ordered Harold to be escorted 
to the ancient town of Rouen* where he thbn was, and 
! where he received him as an honoured griest. Now* some 
writers tell uS that Edward the Cbnfessor, whb was by this 
time old and had no children had made a will* * appointing 
| Duke William of Normandy his successor, and had in- 
formed the Duke of his having done so. There is no doubt 
| that he was anxious about his successor; because he had 
| even invited over, from abroad, Edward the Outlaw, a 
I son of Ironside, who had come to England with his wife 
[ and three children, blit whom the Kih& had strangely re- 
fused to see when he did come, and who had died in Lon- 
don suddenly (princes were terribly liable to sudden' death 
in those days)* and had been buried, in Bt* -Paul's Cathe- 
I dral. The King might possibly have made such a will ; 
i or, having always been fond of the Normans, he might 
i have encouraged Ndrinan William to aspire 1 to the English 
I crown, by something that he said to hiin wheti he was stay- 
| ing at the English court. But* certainly William did now 
i aspire to it; and knowing that Harold would be a powerful 
rival, he called together a great assembly of his, nobles, 
offered Harold his daughter Adele in marriage, informed 
I him that he meant on King Edward’s death to claim the 
English crown as his own inheritance, arid required Harold 
then and there to swear to aid him. Harold, being in the 
Duke’s power, took this oath upon the MisSal, or Prayer* 
book. It is a good example of the superstitions of the 
monks, that this Missal, ihstead of being placed upoir a 
table* was placed upon a tub; which, when Harold had 
sworn, was uncovered, and showpi to befall of dead men’s 
bones — bones, as the monks pretended* eff saints. This 
was supposed to make Harold’s oath a great deal more 
impressive and binding. As if the great name of the 
Creator of Heaven and earth could be made 1 more solemn 
by a knuckle-bone, or a double-tooth, or a finger-nail* of 
Dundtan!

Within a week or two after Harold’s return to England, 
the dreary old Confessor was found to be dying. After 
wandering in his mind like a very weak old man, he died. 
As he had put himself entirely in the hands of the monks 
when he was alive, they praised him lustily when he was 
dead. They had gone so far, already, as to persuade him 
that he could work miracles; and had brought people 
afflicted with a bad disorder of the skin, to him, to be 
touched and cured. This was called “touching for the 
King’s Evil,” which afterwards became a royal custom. 
You know, however, Who really touched the sick, and 
healed them ; and you know His sacred name is not among 
the dusty line of human kings. 


CHAPTER VII. 

ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD THE SECOND, AND CON- 
QUERED BY THE NORMANS. 

Harold was crowned King of England on the very day 
of the maudlin Confessor’s funeral. He had good need to 
be quick about it. When the news reached Norman Will- 
iam, hunting in his park at Rouen, he dropped his bow, 
returned to his palace, called his nobles to council, and 
presently sent ambassadors to Harold, calling on him to 
keep his oath and resign the Crown. Harold would do no 
such thing. The barons of France leagued together round 
Duke William for the invasion of England. Duke William 
promised freely to distribute English wealth and English 
lands among them. The Pope sent to Normandy a conse- 
crated banner, and a ring containing a hair which he war- 
ranted to have grown on the head of Saint Peter. He 
blessed the enterprise; and cursed Harold; and requested 
that the Normans would pay “Peter’s Pence” — or a tax 
to himself of a penny a year on every house — a little more 
regularly in future, if they could make it convenient. 

King Harold had a rebel brother in Flanders, who was 
a vassal of Harold Hardrada, King of Norway. This 
brother, and this Norwegian King, joining their forces 
against England, with Duke William’s help, won a fight in

which the English were commanded by two nobles ; and 
then besieged York. Harold, who was waiting for the 
Normans on the coast at Hastings, with his, army, marched 
to Stamford Bridge upon the river Derwent to give them 
instant battle. 

He found them drawn up in a hollow circle, marked out 
, by their shining spears. Riding round this circle at a dis- 
' tance, to survey it, he saw a brave figure on horseback, in 
a blue mantle and a bright helmet, whose horse suddenly 
stumbled and threw him. 

“Who is that man who has fallen? ” Harold asked of 
one of his captains. 

“The King of Norway,” he replied. 

“He is a tall and stately king,” said Harold, “but his 
end is near.” 

He added, in a little while, “ Go yonder to my brother, 
and tell him, if he withdraw his troops, he shall be Earl 
of Northumberland, and rich and powerful in England.” 

The captain rode away and gave the message. 

| “ What will he give to my friend the King of Norway? ” 

asked the brother. 

“Seven feet of earth for a grave,” replied the captain. 

“No more? ” returned the brother, with a smile. 

“The King of Norway being a tall man, perhaps a little 
more,” replied the captain. 

“Ride back! ” said the brother, “and tell King Harold 
to make ready for the fight ! ” 

; He did so, very soon. And such a fight King Harold 
led against that force, that his brother, and the Norwegian 
King, and every chief of note in all their host, except the 
Norwegian King’s son Olave, to whom he gave honourable 
i dismissal, were left dead upon the field. The victorious 
army marched to York. As King Harold sat there at the 
feast, in the midst of all his company, a stir was heard at 
the dpors ; and messengers all covered with mire from rid- 
ing far and fast through broken ground came hurrying in, 
to report that the Normans had landed in England. 

| The intelligence was true. They had been tossed about 
by contrary winds, and some of their ships had been 
wrecked. A part of their own shore, to which they had 
been driven back, was strewn with Norman bodies. But 
they had once more made sail, led by the Duke’s own gal- 
ley, a present from his wife, upon the prow whereof the

figurp of a golden boy stood pointing towards England. 
Ry day, the banner of the three, Lions of Normandy* the 
diyerse coloured sails, the gilded yanes, the many decora- 
tions of this gorgeous ship, bed glittered in the sun and 
sunny waters; by night, a light had sparkled like a star at 
her mast-head. And npw, encamped near Hastings, with 
their leader lying in the pld Homan castle of Pevensey, the 
English retiring in all direptipns, the land for miles around 
scorched and smoking, bred and pillaged, was the whole 
Norman power, hopeful and strong on English ground. 

Harold broke UP the feast and hurried to London. With- 
in a week, his army was ready. He sent out spies to ascer- 
tain the Norman strength, William took them, paused 
them tp be led through his whole camp, and then dismissed. 
“The Normans,” said these spies to Harold, “are not 
bearded on the upper lip as we English are, but are shprn. 
They are priests.” “Sfy men,” replied Harold, with a 
laugh, “ will find those priests good soldiers! ” 

“The Sa^ops,” reported Duke William’s outposts of 
Norman soldiers, who were instructed to retire as JCiug 
Harold’s army advanced, “ rush on us through their pil- 
laged country with the fury of madmen.” 

“Let them come, and come soon! ” said Duke William. 

Some proposals for a reconciliation were made, but were 
soon abandoned. In the middle pf the month of October, 
in the year one thpusand and sixty-si*, the Normans and 
the English came front to front. All night the armies lay 
encamped before each other, in a part of the country then 
called §en}ac, npw called (in remembrance of them) Rattle. 
With the first dawn of day, they arose. There, in the 
faint light, were the English on a hill; a wood behind 
them; in their midst, the Royal banner, representing a 
fighting warrior, woven in gold thread, adorned with pre- 
cious stones ; beneath the banner, as it rustled iu the wiud, 
stood King Harold on foot, with two of his remaining 
brothers by his side; abound them, still and silent as the 
dead, clustered the whole English army — every soldier 
covered by bis shield, . and bearing in l>is hand his dreaded 
English battle-axe. 

On an opposite hill, in three lines, archers, foot-soldiers, 
horsemen, was the Norman force. Of a sudden, a great 
battle-cry, “God help us!” burst from the Norman lines. 
The English answered with their own battle-cry, “ Qod’s

Bond! Holy Rood! ” The Norinans then came sweeping 
down the hill to attack the English. 

There was one tall Norman Knight who rode beforb the 
Norman army on a prancing hdrse, throwing Up his heavy 
sword and catching it, and singing of the bravery of his 
countryinen. An English Knight, Who rode out from the 
! English force to meet him, fell by this Knight's hand. 
| Another English Knight rode out, and he fell too. But 
| then a third rode out, and killed the Norman. This was in 
| the first beginning of the fight. It soon raged everywhere. 

| The English, keeping side by side in a great mass, 
cared no more for the showers of Norman arrows than if 
they if they had been showers of Nbniian rain. When the 
Norman horsemen rode against them, with their battle-axes 
they cut men and horses down. The Normans gave way. 
The English pressed forward. A cry went forth among 
the Norman troops that Duke William was killed. Duke 
William took off his helmet, in order thafr his face might 
be distinctly seen, and rode along the line before his men. 
This gave them courage. As they turned again to face the 
English, some of their Norman horse divided the pursuing 
body of the English from the rest, and thus all that fore- 
most portion Of the Englifeh army fell, fighting bravely. 
The main body still remaining film, heedless of the Nor- 
man arrows, and With their battle-axes cutting down the 
crowds of horsemen when they rode up, like forests of 
young trees, Duke William pretended to retreat. The 
eager English followed. The Norman army closed again, 
and fell upon them with great slaughter. 

“Still,” said Duke William, “there* are thousands of the 
English, firm as rock around their King. Shoot upward, 
Norman archers, that your arrows may fall dowii upon 
their faces ! ” 

The stm rose high, and sank, and the battle still raged. 
Through all the wild October day, the Clash and din re- 
sounded in the air. In the red sunset, and in the white 
I moonlight, heaps upon heaps of dead men lay strewn, a 
, dreadful spectacle, all over the ground. King Harold, 
wounded with an arrow in the eye, was neaidy 4 blind. His 
brothers were already killed. Twenty Norman Knights, 
whose battered armour had flashed fiery and goldeii in the 
sunshine all day long, and now looked silvery in the moon* 
light, dashed forward to seize the Royal banner from the

English Knights and soldiers, still faithfully collected 
round their blind King. The King received a mortal wound, 
and dropped. The English broke and fled. The Normans 
rallied, and the day was lost. 

O what a sight beneath the moon and stars, when lights 
were shining in the tent of the victorious Duke William, 
which was pitched near the spot where Harold fell — and 
he and his knights were carousing, within — and soldiers 
with torches, going slowly to and fro, without, sought for 
the corpse of Harold among piles of dead — and the War- 
rior, worked in golden thread and precious stones, lay low, 
all torn and soiled with blood — and the three Norman Lions 
kept watch over the field ! 


CHAPTER VIII. 

ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE FIRST, THE NORMAN 
CONQUEROR. 

Upon the ground where the brave Harold fell, William 
the Norman afterwards founded an abbey, which, under 
the name of Battle Abbey, was a rich and splendid place 
through many a troubled year, though now it is a grey ruin 
overgrown with ivy. But the first work he had to do, was 
to conquer the English thoroughly ; and that, as you know 
by this time, was hard work for any man. 

He ravaged several counties; he burned and plundered 
many towns ; he laid waste scores upon scores of miles of 
pleasaut country; he destroyed innumerable lives. At 
length Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury, with other 
representatives of the clergy and the people, went to his 
camp, and submitted to him. Edgar, the insignificant son 
of Edmund Ironside, was proclaimed King by others, but 
nothing came of it. He fled to Scotland afterwards, where 
his sister, who was young and beautiful, married the Scot- 
tish King. Edgar himself was not important enough for 
anybody to care much about him. 

On Christmas Day, William was crowned in Westminster 
Abbey, under the title of William the First; but he is 
best known as William the Conqueror. It was a strauge

coronation. One of the bishops who performed the cere- 
mony asked the Normans, in French, if they would have 
Duke William for their king? They answered Yes. 
Another of the bishops put the same question to the Sax- 
ons, in English. They too answered Yes, with a loud 
shout. The noise being heard by a guard of Norman horse- 
soldiers outside, was mistaken for resistance on the part of 
the English. The guard instantly set fire to the neigh- 
bouring houses, and a tumult ensued; in the midst of 
which the King, being left alone in the Abbey, with a few 
priests (and they all being in a terrible fright together), 
was hurriedly crowned. When the crown was placed upon 
his head, he swore to govern the English as well as the 
, best of their own monarchs. I dare say you think, as I 
do, that if we except the Great Alfred, he might pretty 
easily have done that. 

Numbers of the English nobles had been killed in the 
last disastrous battle. Their estates, and the estates of all 
the nobles who had fought against him there, King Will- 
I iam seized upon, and gave to his own Norman knights and 
nobles. Many great English families of the present time 
acquired their English lands in this way, and are very 
proud of it. 

But what is got by force must be maintained by force. 
These nobles were obliged to build castles all over Eng- 
land, to defend their new property ; and, do what he would, 
the King could neither soothe nor quell the nation as he 
wished. He gradually introduced the Norman language 
and the Norman customs ; yet, for a long time the great 
body of the English remained sullen and revengeful. On 
his going over to Normandy, to visit his subjects there, the 
oppressions of his half-brother Odo, whom he left in charge 
of his English kingdom, drove the people mad. The men of 
Kent even invited over, to take possession of Dover, their 
old enemy Count Eustace of Boulogne, who had led the 
fray when the Dover man was slain at his own fireside. 
The men of Hereford, aided by the Welsh, and commanded 
by a chief named Edbic the Wild, drove the Normans out 
of their country. Some of those who had been dispossessed 
of their lands, banded together in the North of England; 
some, in Scotland ; some, in the thick woods and marshes ; 
and whensoever they could fall upon the Normans, or upon 
tiie English who had submitted to the Normans, they

fought, despoiled, and murdered, like the desperate out- 
laws that they were. Conspiracies were set on foot for a 
general massacre of the Normans, like the old massacre of 
the Danes. In short, the English were in a murderous 
mood all through the kingdom. 

King William, fearing he might lose his conquest, came 
back, and tried to pacify the Xiondon people by soft words. 
He then set forth to repress the country people by stern 
deeds. Among the towns which he besieged, and where he 
killed and maimed the inhabitants without any distinction, 
sparing none, young or old, armed or unarmed, were Oxford, 
Warwick, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Lincoln, York. 
In all these places, and in many others, fire and sword 
worked their utmost horrors, and made the land dreadful 
to behold. The streams and rivers were discoloured with 
blood ; the sky was blackened with smoke ; the fields were 
wastes of ashes ; the waysides were heaped up with dead. 
Such are the fatal results of conquest and ambition ! Al- 
though William was a harsh and angry man, I do not sup- 
pose that he deliberately meant to work this shocking ruin, 
when he invaded England. But what he had got by the 
strong hand, he could only keep by the strong hand, and 
in so doing he made England a great grave. 

Two sons of Harold, by name Edmund and Godwin, 
came over from Ireland, with some ships, against the Nor- 
mans, but were defeated. This was scarcely done, when 
the outlaws in the woods so harassed York, that the Gov- 
ernor sent to the King for help. The King dispatched a 
general and a large force to occupy the town of Durham. 
The Bishop of that place met the general outside the town, 
and warned him not to enter, as he would be in danger 
there. The general cared nothing for the warning, aud 
went in with all his men. That night, on every hill withiu 
sight of Durham, signal fires were seen to blaze. When 
the morning dawned, the English, who had assembled in 
great strength, forced the gates, rushed into the town, and 
slew the Normans every one. The English afterwards be- 
sought the Danes to come and help them. The Danes 
came, with two hundred and forty ships. The outlawed 
nobles joined them ; they captured York, and drove the 
Normans out of that city. Then, William bribed the 
Danes to go away ; and took such vengeance on the Eng- 
lish, that all the former five and sword, smoke and ashes,

death and ruin, were nothihg compared with it. Iii melan- 
choly songs; and doleful stories, it was still sung and told 
by oottage fires on winter evenings* a hundred years after- 
wards, how* in those dreadful days of the Normdns, there 
was not, from the River Humber to the River Tyne* one 
inhabited village left, nor one cultivated field — how there 
! was nothing font a dismal ruin, where the human creatures 
i and the beasts lay dead together. 

! The Outlaws hid, at this time, what they called a Camp 
of Refuge, in the midst of the fens of Cambridgeshire. 
Protected by those marshy gmimds which were difficult of 
approach* they lay among the needs and rushes, and wefo 
hidden by the mists that rosb up from the watery earth* 

| Now, there alsb was* at thdt time, over the sea in Flanders, 
an Englishman named Hkrewakd, whose father had died 
in his absence, and whose property had been given to a 
Ndrman. When he heard of this wrong that had been 
done him (from such of the exiled English as chanced to 
wander into that country), he longed for revenge $ and join- 
ing the outlaws in their camp of refuge, became theifc com- 
mander. HO wds so good a soldier, that the Normans sup- 
posed him to be aided by -enchantment. William, even 
after he hid made a road three miles in length across the 
Cambridgeshire marsheB, on purpose to attack this supposed 
enchanter, thought it necessary to engage an old lady, whb 
pretended to be a sorceress, to coine and do a little enchant- 
ment in the royal cause. For this purpose she was pushed 
on before the troops in a wooden tower; but Hereward 
very soon disposed of this unfortunate soroeress, by burn- 
ing her, tower and all. The monks of the oohVent of Ely 
near at hand, howevefc, who were fond of good living, and 
who found it very uncomfortable to have the country block- 
aded and their supplies of mealt and drink teut off, showed 
the King a secret way of surprising the camp* So Here- 
ward was soon defeated. Whether he afterwards died 
| quietly, or whether he was killed after killihg sixteen of 
I the men who attacked him (as some old rhymes folate that 
- he did), I cafanot say. His defeat put an end to the Camp 
of Refuge* and, very soon afterwards, the King, victorious 
j both in Scotland and in England, quelled the last rebel- 
lious English nofole. He then surrounded himself with 
Norman lords, enriched by the property of English nobles,; 
had a great survey made of ^ " J ^ ™ ^flamd, which

was entered as the property of its new owners, on a roU 
called Doomsday Book ; obliged the people to put out their 
fires and candles at a certain hour every night, on the ring- 
ing of a bell which was called The Curfew ; introduced the 
Norman dresses and manners ; made the Normans masters 
everywhere, and the English, servants; turned out the 
English bishops, and put Normans in their places; and 
showed himself to be the Conqueror indeed. 

But, even with his own Normans, he had a restless life. 
They were always hungering and thirsting for the riches of 
the English ; and the more he gave, the more they wanted. 
His priests were as greedy as his soldiers. We know of 
only one Norman who plainly told his master, the King, 
that he had come with him to England to do his duty as a 
faithful servant, and that property taken by force from 
other men had no charms for him. His name was Guil- 
bert. We should not forget his name, for it is good to 
remember and to honour honest men. 

Besides all these troubles, William the Conqueror was 
troubled by quarrels among his sons. He had three living. 
Robert, called Curthose, because of his short legs ; Will- 
iam, called Rufus or the Red, from the colour of his 
hair; and Henry, fond of learning, and called, in the 
Norman language, Beauclerc, or Fine-Scholar. When 
Robert grew up, he asked of his father the government of 
Normandy, which he had nominally possessed, as a child, 
under his mother, Matilda. The King refusing to grant 
it, Robert became jealous and discontented; and happening 
one day, while in this temper, to be ridiculed by his broth- 
ers, who threw water on him from a balcony as he was 
walking before the door, he drew his sword, rushed up- 
stairs, and was only prevented by the King himself from 
putting them to death. That same night, he hotly de- 
parted with some followers from his father’s court, and 
endeavoured to take the Castle of Rouen by surprise. 
Failing in this, he shut himself up in another Castle in 
Normandy, which the King besieged, and where Robert 
one day unhorsed and nearly killed him without knowing 
who he was. His submission when he discovered his father, 
and the intercession of the Queen and others, reconciled 
them; but not soundly; for Robert soon strayed abroad, 
and went from court to court with his complaints. He was 
a gay, careless, thoughtless fellow, spending all he got on

musicians and dancers; but his mother loved him, and 
! often, against the King’s command, supplied him with 
money through a messenger named Samson. At length 
the incensed King swore he would tear out Samson’s eyes; 
. and Samson, thinking that his only hope of safety was in 
| becoming a monk, became one, went on such errands no 
more, and kept his eyes in his head. 

All this time, from the turbulent day of his strange coro- 
nation, the Conqueror had been struggling, you see, at any 
cost of cruelty and bloodshed, to maintain what he had 
seized. All his reign, he struggled still, with the same 
object ever before him. He was a stem bold man, and he 
succeeded in it. 

He loved money, and was particular in his eating, but he 
had only leisure to indulge one other passion, and that was 
his love of hunting. He carried it to such a height that he 
ordered whole villages and towns to be swept away to make 
forests for the deer. Not satisfied with sixty-eight Royal 
Forests, he laid waste an immense district, to form another 
in .Hampshire, called the New Forest. The many thou- 
sands of miserable peasants who saw their little houses 
pulled down, and themselves and children turned into the 
open country without a shelter, detested him for his merci- 
less addition to their many sufferings ; and when, in the 
twenty-first year of his reign (which proved to be the last), 
he went over to Rouen, England was as full of hatred 
against him, as if every leaf on every tree in all his Royal 
Forests had been a curse upon his head. In the New For- 
est, his son Richard (for he had four sons) had been gored 
to death by a Stag ; and the people said that this so cruelly- 
made Forest would yet be fatal to others of the Conqueror’s 
race. 

He was engaged in a dispute with the King of France 
about some territory. While he stayed at Rouen, negotiat- 
ing with that King, he kept his bed and took medicines : 
being advised by his physicians to do so, on account of 
having grown to an un wieldly size. Word being brought 
to him that the King of France made light of this, and 
joked about it, he swore in a great rage that he should rue 
his jests. He assembled his army, marched into the dis- 
puted territory, burnt — his old way ! — the vines, the erops, 
and fruit, and set the town of Mantes on fire. But, 
in an evil hour; for, as he rode over the hot ruins,

his horse, setting his hoofs upon some burning embers, 
started, threw him forward against the pommel of the sad- 
dle, and gave him a mortal hurt. For six weeks he lay 
dying in a monastery near Rouen, and then made his will, 
giving England to William, Normandy to Robert, and five 
thousand pounds to Henry. And now, his violent deeds 
lay heavy on his mind. He ordered money to be given to 
many English churches and monasteries, and — which Was 
much better repentance — released his prisoners of state, 
some of whom had been confined in his dungeons twenty 
years. 

It was a September morning, and the sun was rising, 
when the King was awakened from slumber by the sound 
of a church bell. “ What bell is that? 99 he faintly asked. 
They told him it was the bell of the chapel of Saint Mary. 
“ I commend my soul, ” said he, “ to Mary ! 99 and died. 

Think of his name, The Conqueror, and then consider 
how he lay in death ! The moment he was dead, his phy- 
sicians, priests, and nobles* not knowing what contest for 
the throne might now take place, or What might happen in 
it, hastened away, each man for himself and his own prop- 
erty ; the mercenary servants of the court began to rob and 
plunder ; the body of the King, in the indecent strife, was 
rolled from the bed, and lay alone, for hours, upon the 
ground. O Conqueror, of whom so many great names are 
proud now, of whom so many great names thought nothing 
then, it were better to have conquered one true heart, than 
England! 

By-and*bye, the priests came creeping in with prayers 
and candles ; and a good knight, named Herluin, under- 
took (which no one else would do) to convey the body to 
Caen, in Normandy, in order that it might be buried in Sfc. 
Stephen's church there, which the Conqueror had founded. 
Rut fire, of which he had made such bad use in his life, 
seemed to follow him of itself in death. A great conflagra- 
tion broke out in the town when the body was placed in 
the church ; and those present running out to extinguish 
the flames, it was once again left alone. 

It was not even buried in peace. It was about to be let 
down, in its Royal robes, into a tomb near the high altar, 
in presence of a great concourse of people, when a loud 
voice in the crowd cried out,. “ This ground is mine I Upou 
it, stood my father's house. This King despoiled me of

both ground and house to build this church. In the great 
name of God, I here forbid his body to be covered with 
the earth that is my right ! ” The priests and bishops 
present, knowing the speaker’s right, and knowing that 
the King had often denied him justice, paid him down sixty 
shillings for the grave. Even then, the corpse was noi at 
rest. The tomb was too smaU, and they tried to force it 
in. It broke, a dreadful smell arose, the people hurried 
out into the air, and, for the third time, it was left alone. 

Where were the Conqueror’s three sons, that they were 
not at their father’s burial? Robert was lounging among 
minstrels, dancers, and gamesters, in France or Germany. 
Henry was carrying his five thousand pounds safely away 
in a convenient chest he had got made. William the Red 
was hurrying to England, to lay hands upon the Royal 
treasure and the crown. 


CHAPTER IX. 

ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE SECOND, CALLED 
RUFUS. 

William thb Rbd, in breathless haste, secured the three 
great forts of Dover, Pevensey, and Hastings, and made 
with hot speed for Winchester, where the Royal treasure 
was kept. The treasurer delivering him the keys, he found 
that it amounted to sixty thousand pounds in silver, be- 
sides gold and jewels. Possessed of this wealth, he soon 
persuaded the Archbishop of Canterbury to crown him, and 
became William the Second, King of England. 

Rufus was no sooner on the throne, than he ordered into 
prison again the unhappy state captives whom his father 
had set free, and directed a goldsmith to ornament his 
father’s tomb profusely with gold and silver. It would 
have been more dutiful in him to have attended the sick 
Conqueror when he was dying ; but England, itself, like 
this Red King, who once governed it, has sometimes made 
expensive tombs for dead men whom it treated shabbily 
when they were alive. 

The King’s brother, Robert of Normandy, seeming quite

content to be only Duke of that country ; and the King’s 
other brother, Fine-Scholar, being quiet enough with his 
five thousand pounds in a chest ; the King flattered him- 
self, we may suppose, with the hope of an easy reign. But 
easy reigns were difficult to have in those days. The tur- 
bulent Bishop Odo (who had blessed the Norman army at 
the Battle of Hastings, and who, I dare say, took all the 
credit of the victory to himself) soon began, in concert 
with some powerful Norman nobles, to trouble the Bed 
King. 

The truth seems to be that this bishop and his friends, 
who had lands in England and lands in Normandy, wished 
to hold both under one Sovereign ; and greatly preferred a 
thoughtless good-natured person, such as Robert was, to 
Rufus ; who, though far from being an amiable man in any 
respect, was keen, and not to be imposed upon. They de- 
clared in Robert’s favour, and retired to their castles (those 
castles were very troublesome to kings) in a sullen humour. 
The Red King, seeing the Normans thus falling from him, 
revenged himself upon them by appealing to the English; 
to whom he made a variety of promises, which he never 
meant to perform — in particular, promises to soften the 
cruelty of the Forest Laws ; and who, in return, so aided 
him with their valour, that Odo was besieged in the Castle 
of Rochester, and forced to abandon it, and to depart from 
England for ever : whereupon the other rebellious Norman 
nobles were soon reduced and scattered. 

Then, the Red King went over to Normandy, where the 
people suffered greatly under the loose rule of Duke Robert. 
The King’s object was to seize upon the Duke’s dominions. 
This, the Duke, of course, prepared to resist; and miser- 
able war between the two brothers seemed inevitable, when 
the powerful nobles on both sides, who had seen so much 
of war, interfered to prevent it. A treaty was made. 
Each of the two brothers agreed to give up something of 
his claims, and that the longer-liver of the two should in- 
herit all the dominions of the other. When they had 
come to this loving understanding, they embraced and 
joined their forces against Fine-Scholar; who had bought 
some territory of Robert with a part of his five thou- 
sand pounds, and was considered a dangerous individual in 
consequence. 

St. Michael’s Mount, in Normandy (there is another St.

Michael's Mount, in Cornwall, wonderfully like it), was 
then, as it is now, a strong place perched upon the top of 
a high rock, around which, when the tide is in, the sea 
flows, leaving no road to the mainland. In this place, 
Fine-Scholar shut himself up with his soldiers, and here he 
was closely besieged by his two brothers. At one time, 
when he was reduced to great distress for want of water, 
the generous Robert not only permitted his men to get 
water, but sent Fine-Scholar wine from his own table ; and, 
on being remonstrated with by the Red King, said, 
“ What ! shall we let our own brother die of thirst? Where 
shall we get another, when he is gone? ” At another time, 
the Red King riding alone on the shore of the bay, looking 
up at the Castle, was taken by two of Fine-Scholar's men, 
one of whom was about to kill him, when he cried out, 
“Hold, knave! I am the King of England!" The story 
says that the soldier raised him from the ground respect- 
fully and humbly, and that the King took him into his 
service. The story may or may not be true ; but at any 
rate it is true that Fine-Scholar could not hold out against 
his united brothers, and that he abandoned Mount St. 
Michael, and wandered about — as poor and forlorn as other 
scholars have been sometimes known to be. 

The Scotch became unquiet in the Red King’s time, and 
were twice defeated — the second time, with the loss of 
their King, Malcolm, and his son. The Welsh became un- 
quiet too. Against them, Rufus was less successful ; for 
they fought among their native mountains, and did great 
execution on the King’s troops. Robert of Normandy be- 
came unquiet too ; and, complaining that his brother the 
King did not faithfully perform his part of their agree- 
ment, took up arms, and obtained assistance from the King 
of France, whom Rufus, in the end, bought off with vast 
sums of money. England became unquiet too. Lord 
Mowbray, the powerful Earl of Northumberland, headed a 
great conspiracy to depose the King, and to place upon the 
throne, Stephen, the Conqueror’s near relative. The plot 
was discovered; all the chief conspirators were seized; 
some were fined, some were put in prison, Borne were put 
to death. The Earl of Northumberland himself was shut 
up in a dungeon beneath Windsor Castle, where he died, 
an old man, thirty long years afterwards. The Priests in 
England were more unquiet than any other class or power;

for the Red King treated them with such small ceremony 
that he refused to appoint new bishops or archbishops 
when the old ones died, but kept all the wealth belonging 
to those officers in his own hands. In return for this, the 
Priests wrote his life when he was dead, and abused him 
well. I am inclined to think, myself, that there was little 
to choose between the Priests and the Red King; that both 
sides were greedy and designing; and that they were fairly 
piatched. 

The Red King was false of heart, selfish, covetous, and 
mean. He had a worthy minister in his favourite, Ralph, 
nicknamed — for almost every famous person had a uick- 
name in those rough days — Flambard, or the Firebrand. 
Once, the King being ill, became penitent, and made An- 
selm, a foreign priest and a good man, Archbishop of Can- 
terbury. But he no sooner got well again than he repented 
of his repentance, and persisted in wrongfully keeping to 
himself some of the wealth belonging to the archbishopric. 
This led to violent disputes, which were aggravated by 
there being in Rome at that time two rival Ropes ; each of 
whom declared he was the only real original infallible 
Pope, who couldn’t make a mistake. At last, Anselm, 
knowing the Red King’s character, and not feeling himself 
safe in England, asked leave to return abroad. The Red 
King gladly gave it ; for he knew that as soon as Anselm 
was gone, he could begin to store up all the Canterbury 
money again, for his own use. 

By such means, and by taxing and oppressing the Eng- 
lish people in every possible way, the Red King became 
very rich. When he wanted money for any purpose, he 
raised it by some means or other, and cared nothing for the 
injustice he did, or the misery he caused. Having the op- 
portunity of buying from Robert the whole duchy pf Nor- 
mandy for five years, he taxed the English people more 
than ever, and made the very convents sell their plate and 
valuables to supply him with the means to make the pur- 
chase. But he was as quick and eager in putting down 
revolt as he was in raising money; for, a part of the 
Norman people objecting— very naturally, I think — to being 
sold in this way, he headed an army against them with all 
the speed and energy of his father. He was so impatient, 
that he embarked for Normandy in a great gale of wind 
And when tho sailors told him it was dangerous to go to

sea in such angry weather, he replied, “ Hoist sail and 
away ! Did you ever hear of a king who was drowned? ” 

You will wonder how it was that even the careless Robert 
came to sell his dominions. It happened thus. It had 
long been the custom fox many English p&ople to make 
journeys to Jerusalem, which were called pilgrimages, in 
order that they might pray beside the tomb of Our Saviour 
there. Jerusalem belonging to the Turks, and the Turks 
hating Christianity, these Christian travellers were often 
insulted and ill used. The Pilgrims bore it patiently for 
some time, but at length a remarkable man, of great ear- 
nestness and eloquence, called Peter the Hermit, began 
to preach in various places against the Turks, and to de- 
clare that it was the duty of good Christians to drive away 
those unbelievers from the tomb of Our Saviour, and to 
take possession of it, and protect it. An excitement such 
as the world had never known before was ereUtedw Thou- 
sands and thousands of men of all ranks and conditions de J 
parted for Jerusalem to lhake war against the Tfirks: The 
war is called in history the first Crusade;* and every Cru- 
sader Wore a cross marked on his right shoulder. 

All the Crusaders were not zealous Christians. Among 
them were vast numbers of the restless, idle, profligate, and 
adventur ous spirits of the time. Some became Crusaders 
for the love of change ; some, in the hope of plunder; some, 
because they had nothing to do at home ; some, because 
they did what the priests told them ; some, because they 
liked to see foreign countries ; some; because they were 
fond of knocking men about, and would as soon knock a 
Turk about aS a Christian . Robert of N ormandy may have 
been influenced by all these motives ; and by a kind desite, 
besides, to save the Christian Pilgrims from bad treatment 
in future.. He wanted to raise a number of armed men, 
and to go to the Crusade. He could not do so without 
money. He had no money; and he sold his dominions to 
his brother, the Red King, for five years. With the large 
sum he thus obtained, he fitted out his Crusaders gallantly, 
and went away to Jerusalem in martial state. The Red 
King, who made money out of everything, stayed at home, 
busily squeezing more money out of Normans and* English. 

After three years of great hardship and suffering— from 
shipwreck at sea; from travel in strange lands; from hhn- 
gar, thirst, and fever, upon the burning sands of the desert p

and from the fury of the Turks — the valiant Crusaders got 
possession of Our Saviour’s tomb. The Turks were still 
resisting and fighting bravely, but this success increased the 
general desire in Europe to join the Crusade. Another 
great French Duke was proposing to sell his dominions for 
a term to the rich Red King, when the Red King’s reign 
came to a sudden and violent end. 

You have not forgotten the New Forest which the Con- 
queror made, and which the miserable people whose homes 
he had laid waste, so hated. The cruelty of the Forest 
Laws, and the torture and death they brought upon the 
peasantry, increased this hatred. The poor persecuted 
country people believed that the New Forest was enchanted. 
They said that in thunder-storms, and on dark nights, de- 
mons appeared, moving beneath the branches of the gloomy 
trees. They said that a terrible spectre had foretold to 
Norman hunters that the Red King should be punished 
there. And now, in the pleasant season of May, when the 
Red King had reigned almost thirteen years; and a second 
Prince of the Conqueror’s blood — another Richard, the son 
of Duke Robert — was killed by an arrow in this dreaded 
Forest; the people said that the second time was not the 
last, and that there was another death to come. 

It was a lonely forest, accursed in the people’s hearts 
for the wicked deeds that had been done to make it ; and 
no man save the King and his Courtiers and Huntsmen, 
liked to stray there. But, in reality, it was like any other 
forest. In the spring, the green leaves broke out of the 
buds ; in the summer, flourished heartily, and made deep 
shades ; in the winter, shrivelled and blew down, and lay 
in brown heaps on the moss. Some trees were stately, and 
grew high and strong; some had fallen of themselves; 
some were felled by the forester’s axe; some were hoHow, 
and the rabbits burrowed at their roots ; some few were 
struck by lightning, and stood white and bare. There were 
hiU-sides covered with rich fern, on which the morning 
dew so beautifully sparkled ; there were brooks, where the 
deer went down to drink, or over which the whole herd 
bounded, flying from the arrows of the huntsmen ; there 
were sunny glades, and solemn places where but little light 
came through the rustling leaves. The songs of the birds 
in the New Forest were pleasanter to hear than the shouts 
of fighting men outside; and even when the Red King and

his Court came punting through its solitudes, cursing loud 
and riding hard, with a jingling of stirrups and bridles and 
knives and daggers, they did much less harm there than 
among the English or Normans, and the stags died (as 
they lived) far easier than the people. 

Upon a day in August, the Red King, now reconciled to 
his brother, Fine-Scholar, came with a great train to hunt 
in the New Forest. Fine-Scholar was of the party. They 
were a merry party, and had lain all night at Malwood- 
Keep, a hunting-lodge in the forest, where they had made 
good cheer, both at supper and breakfast, and had drunk 
a deal of wine. The party dispersed in various directions, 
as the custom of hunters then was. The King took with 
him only Sir Walter Tyrrel, who was a famous sports- 
nun, and to whom he had given, before they mounted 
horse that morning, two fine arrows. 

The last time the King was t ?r seen alive, he was rid- 
ing with Sir Walter Tyrrel, and their dogs were hunting 
together. 

It was almost night, when a poor charcoal-burner, pass- 
ing through the forest with his cart, came upon the solitary 
body of a dead man, shot with an arrow in the breast, and 
still bleeding. He got it into his cart. It was the body 
of the King. Shaken and tumbled, with its red beard all 
whitened with lime and clotted with blood, it was driven 
in the cart by the charcoal-burner next day to Winchester 
Cathedral, where it was received and buried. 

Sir Walter Tyrrel, who escaped to Normandy, and 
claimed the protection of the King of France, swore in 
France that the Red King was suddenly shot dead by an 
arrow from an unseen hand, while they were hunting to- 
gether ; that he was fearful of being suspected as the King’s 
murderer ; and that he instantly set spurs to his horse, and 
fled to the sea-shoTe. Others declared that the King and 
Sir Walter Tyrrel were hunting in company, a little before 
sunset, standing in bushes opposite one another, when a 
stag came between them. That the King drew his bow 
and took aim, but the string broke. That the King then 
cried, " Shoot, Walter, in the Devil’s name ! ” That Sir 
Walter shot. That the arrow glanced against a tree, was 
turned aside from the stag, and struck the King from his 
florae, dead. 

By whose hand the Red King really fell, and whether

that hand despatched the arrow to his breast by accident or 
by design, is only known to God. Some think his brother 
may have caused him to be killed ; but the Red King had 
made so many enemies, both among priests and people, 
that suspicion may reasonably rest upon a less unnatural 
murderer. Men know no more than that he was found 
dead in the New Forest, which the suffering people had 
regarded as a doomed ground for his race* 


CHAPTER X. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIRST, CALLED FINE- 
SCHOLAR. 

Fine-Scholar, on hearing of the Red King’s death, hur- 
ried to Winchester with as much speed as Rufus himself 
had made, to seize the Royal treasure* But the keeper of 
the treasure, who had been one of the hunting-party in the 
Forest, made haste to Winchester too, and, arriving there 
at about the same time, refused to yield it up. Upon this, 
Fine-Scholar drew his sword, and threatened to kill the 
treasurer ; who might have paid for his fidelity with his 
life, but that he knew longer resistance to be useless when 
he found the Prince supported by a company of powerful 
barons, who declared they were determined to make him 
King. The treasurer, therefore, gave up the money and 
jewels of the Crown : and on the third day after the death 
of the Red King, being a Sunday, Fine-Scholar stood be- 
fore the high altar in Westminster Abbey, and made a Sol- 
emn declaration that he would resign the Church property 
which his brother had Seized; that he would do lio wrong 
to the nobles ; and that he would restore to the people the 
laws of Edward the Confessor, with all the improvements 
of William the Conqueror. So began the reign of Kino 
Henry the First. 

The people were attached to their new King, both be- 
cause he had known distresses, and because he was an Eng- 
lishman by birth and not a Norman. To strengthen this 
last hold upon them, the King wished to many an English 
lady ; and could think of no other wife than Maud the

Good, the daughter of the King of Scotland. Although 
this good Princess did not love the King, she was so affected 
by the representations the nobles made to her of the great 
charity it would be in her to unite the Norman and Saxon 
races, and prevent hatred and bloodshed between them for 
the future, that she consented to become his wife. After 
some disputing among the priests, who said that as she had 
been in a convent in her youth, and had worn the veil of a 
nun, she could not lawfully be married — against which the 
Princess stated that her aunt, with whom she had lived in 
her youth, had indeed sometimes thrown a piece of black 
stuff over her, but for no other reason than because the 
nun’s veil was the only dress the conquering Normans re- 
spected in girl or woman, and not because she had taken 
the vows of a nun, which she never had— she was declared 
fiee to marry, and was made King Henry’s Queen. A 
good Queen she was; beautiful, kind-hearted, and worthy' 
of a better husband than the King. 

For he was a cunning and unscrupulous man, though 
firm and clever. He cared very little for his word, and 
took any means to gain his ends. All this is shown in his 
treatment of his brother Robert — Robert, who had suffered 
him to be refreshed with water, and who had sent him the 
wine from his own table, when he was shut up, with the 
crows flying below him, parched with thirst, in the castle 
on the top of St. Michael’s Mount, where his Red brother 
would have let him die. 

Before the King began to deal with Robert, he removed 
and disgraced all the favourites of the late King; who 
were for the most part base characters, much detested by 
the people. Flambard, or Firebrand, whom the late King 
had made Bishop of Durham, of all things in the world, 
Henry imprisoned in the Tower ; but Firebrand was a great 
joker and a jolly companion, and made himself so popular 
with his guards that they pretended to know nothing about 
a long rope that was sent into his prison at the bottom of 
a deep flagon of wine. The guards took the wins, and 
Firebrand took the rope ; with which, when they were fast 
asleep, he let himself down from a window in the night, 
and so got cleverly aboard ship and away to> Normandy, 

Now Robert, when his brother Fine- Scholar came to the 
throne, was still absent in the Holy Land. Henry pre- 
tended that Robert had been made Sovereign of that couu-

try ; and he had been away so long, that the ignorant people 
believed it. Bat, behold, when Henry had been some time 
King of England, Robert came home to Normandy ; having 
leisurely returned from Jerusalem through Italy, in which 
beautiful country he had enjoyed himself very much, and 
had married a lady as beautiful as itself ! In Normandy, 
he found Firebrand waiting to urge him to assert his claim 
to the English crown, and declare war against King Henry. 
This, after great loss of time in feasting and dancing with 
his beautiful Italian wife among his Norman friends, he at 
last did. 

The English in general were on King Henry’s side, 
though many of the Normans were on Robert’s. But the 
English sailors deserted the King, and took a great part of 
the English fleet over to Normandy; so that Robert came 
to invade this country in no foreign vessels, but in English 
ships. The virtuous Anselm, however, whom Henry had 
invited back from abroad, and made Archbishop of Canter- 
bury, was steadfast in the King’s cause; and it was so well 
supported that the two armies, instead of fighting, made a 
peace. Poor Robert, who trusted anybody and everybody, 
readily trusted his brother, the King ; and agreed to go 
home and receive a pension from England, on condition 
that all his followers were fully pardoned. This the King 
very faithfully promised, but Robert was no sooner gone 
than he began to punish them. 

Among them was the Earl of Shrewsbury, who, on being 
summoned by the King to answer to five-and-forty accusa- 
tions, rode away to one of his strong castles, shut himself 
up therein, called around him his tenants and vassals, and 
fought for his liberty, but was defeated and banished. 
Robert, with all his faults, was so true to his word, that 
when he first heard of this nobleman having risen against 
his brother, he laid waste the Earl of Shrewsbury’s estates 
in Normandy, to show the King that he would favour no 
breach of their treaty. Finding, on better information, 
afterwards, that the Earl’s only crime was having been his 
friend, he came over to England, in his old thoughtless 
warm-hearted way, to intercede with the King, and remind 
him of the solemn promise to pardon all his followers. 

This confidence might have put the false King to the 
blush, but it did not. Pretending to be very friendly, he 
so surrounded his brother with spies and traps, that Robert,

| who was quit© in his power, had nothing for it but- to re- 
nounce his pension and escape while he could. Getting 
home to Normandy, and understanding the King better 
now, he naturally allied himself with his old friend the 
Earl of Shrewsbury, who had still thirty castles in that 
country. This was exactly what Henry wanted. He im- 
mediately declared that Robert had broken the treaty, and 
next year invaded Normandy. 

He pretended that he came to deliver the Normans, at 
their own request, from his brother’s misrule. There is 
reason to fear that his misrule was bad enough ; for his 
beautiful wife had died, leaving him with an infant son, 
and his court was again so careless, dissipated, and ill- 
regulated, that it was said he sometimes lay in bed of a day 
for want of clothes to put on — his attendants having stolen 
all his dresses. But he headed his army like a brave prince 
and a gallant soldier, though he had the misfortune to be 
taken prisoner by King Henry, with four hundred of his 
Knights. Among them was poor harmless Edgar Atheling, 
who loved Robert well. Edgar was not important enough 
to be severe with. The King afterwards gave him a small 
pension, which he lived upon and died upon, in peace, 
among the quiet woods and fields of England. 

And Robert — poor, kind, generous, wasteful, heedless 
Robert, with so many faults, and yet with virtues that 
might have made a better and a happier man — what was 
the end of him? If the King had had the magnanimity to 
say with a kind air, “ Brother, tell me, before these noble- 
men, that from this time you will be my faithful follower 
and friend, and never raise your hand against me or my 
forces more ! ” he might have trusted Robert to the death. 
But the King was not a magnanimous man. He sentenced 
his brother to be confined for life in one of the Royal Cas- 
tles. In the beginning of his imprisonment, he was al- 
lowed to ride out, guarded ; but he one day broke away 
| from his guard and galloped off. He had the evil fortune 
to ride into a swamp, where his horse stuck fast and he 
was taken. When the King heard of it he ordered him to 
be blinded, which was done by putting a red-hot metal 
basin on his eyes. 

And bo, in darkness and in prison, many years, he 
thought of all his past life, of the time he had wasted, of 
the treasure he had squandered, of the opportunities he

had lost, of the youth he had thrown away, of the talents 
he had neglected. Sometimes, on fine autumn mornings, 
he would sit and think of the old hunting parties in the 
free Forest, where he had been the foremost and the gayest. 
Sometimes, in the still nights, he would wake, and mourn 
for the many nights that had stolen past him at the gam- 
ing-table ; sometimes, would seem to hear, upon the melan- 
choly wind, the old songs of the minstrels; sometimes, 
would dream, in his blindness, of the light and glitter of 
the Norman Court. Many and many a time, he groped 
back, in his fancy, to Jerusalem, where he had fought so 
well ; or, at the head of his brave companions, bowed his 
feathered helmet to the shouts of welcome greeting him in 
Italy, and seemed again to walk among the sunny vine- 
yards, or on the shore of the blue sea, with his lovely wife. 
And then, thinking of her grave, and of his fatherless boy, 
he would stretch out his solitary arms and weep. 

At length, one day, there lay in prison, dead, with cruel 
and disfiguring sears upon his eyelids, bandaged from his 
jailer’s sight, but on which the eternal Heavens looked 
down, a worn old man of eighty. He had once been 
Robert of Normandy. Pity him ! 

At the time when Robert of Normandy was taken pris- 
oner by his brother, Robert’ 9 little son was only five years 
old. This child was taken, too, and carried before the King, 
sobbing and crying; for, young as he was, he knew he had 
good reason to be afraid of his Royal uncle. The King 
was not much accustomed to pity those who were in his 
power, but his cold heart seemed for the moment to soften 
towards the boy. He was observed to make a great effort, 
as if to prevent himself from being cruel, and order the 
child to be taken away ; whereupon a certain Baron, who 
had married a daughter of Duke Robert’s (by name, Helie 
of Saint Saen), took charge of him, tenderly. The King’s 
gentleness did not last long. Before two years were over, 
he sent messengers to this lord’s Castle to seize the child 
and bring him away. The Baron was not there at the time, 
but his servants were faithful, and carried the boy off in 
his sleep and hid him. When the Baron came home, and 
was told what the King had done, he took the child abroad, 
and, leading him by the hand, went from King to King 
and from Court to Court, relating how the child had a olaim 
to the throne of England, and how his uncle the King,

knowing that he had that claim, would haye murdered him, 
perhaps, but for his escape. 

The youth and innooenoe of the pretty little William 
Fitz-Robert (for that was his name) made him many 
friends at that time. When he became a young man, the 
King of France, uniting with the French Counts of Anjou 
and Flanders, supported his cause against the King of 
England, and took many of the King’s towns and castles 
in Normandy. But, King Henry, artful and cunning 
always, bribed some of William’s friends with money, 
some with promises, some with power. He bought off the 
Count of Anjou, by promising to marry his eldest son, also 
named William, to the Count’s daughter; and indeed the 
whole trust of this King’s life was in such bargains, and 
he believed (as many another King has done since, and as 
one King did in France a very little time ago) that every 
man’s truth and honour can be bought at some price. For 
all this, he was so afraid of William Fitz-Robert and his 
friends, that, for a long time, he believed his life to be in 
danger; and never laydown to sleep, even in his palace 
surrounded by his guards, without having a sword and 
buckler at his bedside. 

To strengthen his power, the King with great ceremony 
betrothed his eldest daughter Matilda, then a child only 
eight years old, to be the wife of Henry the Fifth, the 1 Em- 
peror of Germany. To raise her marriage-portion, he taked 
the English people ill a most oppressive manner then 
treated them to a great procession, to restore dhbir^ood 
humour; and sent Matilda away, in fine state , 1 with tWe 
German ambassadors, to be educated in the oounrtdy 1 bf her 
future husband. r inR >iiil // 

And now his Queen, Maud the Good, unhappily died. 
It was a sad thought for that gentle lady, thati'tlfe*ddly 
hope with which she had married a man wholm"Bhb:had 
never loved— the hope of reconciling the NonUan hitd Eng- 
lish races — had failed. At the very time of hfer death, 
Normandy and all France was in arms a gain it 'England; 
for, so soon as his last danger was over, King Ffenry had 
been false to all the French powers he had promised/ 'bribed,

ever was the matter), he began to promise, bribe, and buy

again ; and by those means, and by the help of the Pope, 
who exerted himself to save more bloodshed, and by sol- 
emnly declaring, over and over again, that he really was 
in earnest this time, and would keep his word, the Xing 
made peace. 

One of the first consequences of this peace was, that the 
King went over to Normandy with his son Prince William 
and a great retinue, to have the Prince acknowledged as 
his successor by the Norman Nobles, and to contract the 
promised marriage (this was one of the many promises the 
King had broken) between him and the daughter of the 
Count of Anjou. Both these things were triumphantly 
done, with great show arid rejoicing; and on the twenty- 
fifth of November, in the year one thousand one hundred 
and twenty, the whole retinue prepared to embark at the 
Port of Barfleur, for the voyage home. 

On that day, and at that place, there came to the King, 
Fitz-Stephen, a sea-captain, and said : 

“ My liege, my father served your father all his life, 
upon the sea. He steered the ship with the golden boy 
upon the prow, in which your father sailed to conquer 
England. I beseech you to grant me the same office. I 
have a fair vessel in the harbour here, called The White 
Ship, manned by fifty sailors of renown. I pray you, Sire, 
to lefeyour servant have the honour of steering you in The 
White Ship to England ! ” 

» 'ifil qmxsorry, friend,” replied the King, “that my vessel 
iaiajfeadflttchosen, and that I cannot (therefore) sail with 
the afai v0^4he man who served my father. But the Prince 
and fcUY'htWjj company shall go along with you, in the fair 
White Ship, manned by the fifty sailors of renown.” 
.[>Ah^bqqjor two afterwards, the King set sail in the ves- 
s^liheohfccb chosen, accompanied by other vessels, and, sail- 
ingf alt aiight with a fair and gentle wind, arrived upon the 
qoafcfc Jofi England in the morning. While it was yet night, 
thajj-pfeopld in some of those ships heard a faint wild cry 
cbinri<aYHr the sea, and wondered what it was.

of eight^fon** who bore no love to the English, and had de- 
clared that when he came to the throne he would yoke 
them to the plough like oxen. He went aboard The White 
Ship, with one hundred and forty youthful Nobles like 
himself, among whom were eighteen noble ladies of the

highest rank. All this gay company, with their servants 
and the fifty sailors, made three hundred souls aboard the 
fair White Ship. 

“ Give three casks of wine, Fitz-Stephen,” said the Prince, 
“ to the fifty sailors of renown ! My father the King has 
sailed out of the harbour. What time is there to make 
l merry here, and yet reach England with the rest? ” 

' “Prince,” said Fitz-Stephen, “before morning, my fifty 
and The White Ship shall overtake the swiftest vessel in 
I attendance on your father the King, if we sail at mid- 
night ! ” 

Then, the Prince commanded to make merry ; and the 
sailors drank out the three casks of wine ; and the Prince 
and all the noble company danced in the moonlight on the 
deck of The White Ship. 

When, at last, she shot out of the harbour of Barfleur, 
there was not a sober seaman on board. But the sails were 
all set, and the oars all going merrily. Fitz-Stephen had 
the helm. The gay young Nobles and the beautiful ladies, 
wrapped in mantles of various bright colours to protect 
them from the cold, talked, laughed, and sang. The Prince 
encouraged the fifty sailors to row harder yet, for the hon- 
our of The White Ship. 

Crash ! A terrific cry broke from three hundred hearts. 
It was the cry the people in the distant vessels of the King 
heard faintly on the water. The White Ship had struck 
upon a rock — was filling — going down ! 

Fitz-Stephen hurried the Prince into a boat, with some 
few Nobles. “Push off,” he whispered; “and row to the 
land. It is not far, and the sea is smooth. The rest of 
us must die.” 

But, as they rowed away, fast, from the sinking ship, 

| the Prince heard the voice of his sister Marie, the Count- 
I ess of Perche, calling for help. He never in his life had 
been so good as he was then. He cried in an agony, 

I “Row back at any risk! I cannot bear to leave her! ” 

They rowed back. As the Prince held out his arms to 
catch his sister, such numbers leaped in, that the boat was 
overset. And in the same instant The White Ship went 
down. 

Only two men floated. They both clung to the main 
yard of the ship, which had broken from the mast, and 
now supported them. One ask''' 3 *' • who he was?

Hie said, “I am a nobleman, Godfrey byname, the son of 
Gilbert de i? Aigle. And you? ” said be. “ I am B»- 
rold, a poor butcher of Rouen,” was the answer. Then, 
they said together, “ Lord be merciful to us both ! ” and 
tried to encourage one another, as they drifted in the cold 
benumbing sea on that unfortunate November night. 

By-and-bye, another man came swimming towards them, 
whom they knew, when he pushed aside his long wet hair, 
to be Fitz-Stephen. “ Where is the Prince ? 99 said he. 
“Gone! Gone I” the two cried together. “Neither he, 
nor his brother, nor his sister, nor the King’s niece, nor 
her brother, nor any one of all the brave three hundred, 
noble or commoner, except we three, has risen above the 
water ! 99 Fitz-Stephen, with a ghastly face, cried, “ Woe! 
woe, to me ! ” and sunk to the bottom. 

The other two clung to the yard for some hours. At 
length the young noble said faintly, “ I am exhausted, and 
chilled with the cold, and can hold no longer. Farewell, 
good friend ! God preserve you ! 99 So, he dropped and 
sunk; and of all the brilliant crowd, the poor Butcher of 
Rouen alone was saved. In the morning, some fishermen 
saw him floating in his sheepskin coat, and got him into 
their boat — the sole relater of the dismal tale. 

For three days, no one dared to carry the intelligence to 
the King. At length, they sent into his presence a little 
boy, who, weeping bitterly, and kneeling at his feet, told 
him that The White Ship was lost with all on board. The 
King fell to the ground like a dead man, and never, never 
afterwards, was seen to smile. 

But he plotted again, and promised again, and bribed 
and bought again, in his old deceitful way. Having no 
sou to succeed him, after all his pains (“The Prince will 
never yoke us to the plough, now ! 99 said the English peo- 
ple), he took a second wife — Adelais or Alice, a duke’s 
daughter, and the Pope’s niece. Having no more children, 
however, he proposed to the Barons to swear that they 
would recognise as his successor, his daughter Matilda, 
whom* as she was.no^ a widow, he married to the eldest 
son of the Count of Anjou, Geoffrey, sumamed Plak- 
tagenet, from a custom he had of wearing a sprig of 
flowering broom (called Gen$t in French) in his cap for a 
feather. As one false man usually makes many, and as a 
false King, in particular, is pretty certain to make a false

Court, the Barons took the oath about the succession of 
Matilda (and her children after her), twice over, without 
in the least intending to keep it. The King was now re- 
lieved from any remaining fears of William Fitz-Robert, 
by his death in the Monastery of St. Omer, in France, at 
twenty-six years old, of a pike-wound in the hand. And 
as Matilda gave birth to three sons, he thought the succes- 
sion to the throne secure. 

He spent most of the latter part of his life, which was 
troubled by family quarrels, in Normandy, to be near Ma- 
tilda. When he had reigned upwards of thirty-live years, 
and was sixty-seven years old, he died of an indigestion 
and fever, brought on by eating, when he was far from 
well, of a fish called Lamprey, against which he had often 
been cautioned by his physicians. His remains were 
brought over to Reading Abbey to be buried. 

You may perhaps hear the cunning and promise-breaking 
of King Henry the First called “ policy ” by some people, 
and “diplomacy” by others. Neither of these fine words 
will in the least mean that it was true; and nothing that is 
not true can possibly be good 

His greatest merit, that I know of, was his love of learn- 
ing. I should have given him greater credit even for that, 
if it had been strong enough to induce him to spare the eyes 
of a certain poet he once took prisoner, who was a knight 
besides. But he ordered the poet’s eyes to be tom from 
his head, because he had laughed at him in his verses; 
and the poet, in the pain of that torture, dashed out his 
own brains against his prison wall. King Henry the 
First was avaricious, revengeful, and so false, that I sup- 
pose a man never lived whose word was less to be relied 
upon. 


CHAPTER XL 

ENGLAND UNDER MATILDA AND STEPHEN. 

The King was no sooner dead than all the plans and

A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


Stephen was the son of Adel a, the Conqueror’s daugh- 
ter, married to the Count of Blois. To Stephen, and to his 
brother Henry, the late King had been liberal; making 
Henry Bishop of Winchester, and finding a good marriage 
for Stephen, and much enriching him. This did not pre- 
vent Stephen from hastily producing a false witness, a ser- 
vant of the late King, to swear that the King had named 
him for his heir upon his death-bed. On this evidence the 
Archbishop of Canterbury crowned him. The new King, 
so suddenly made, lost not a moment in seizing the Royal 
treasure, and hiring foreign soldiers with some of it to pro- 
tect his throne. 

If the dead King had even done as the false witness said, 
he would have had small right to will away the English 
people, like so many sheep or oxen, without their consent. 
But he had, in fact, bequeathed all his territory to Matil- 
da; who, supported by Robert, Earl of Gloucester, soon 
began to dispute the crown. Some of the powerful barons 
and priests took her side; some took Stephen’s; all forti- 
fied their castles; and again the miserable English people 
were involved in war, from which they could never derive 
advantage whosoever was victorious, and in which all par- 
ties plundered, tortured, starved, and ruined them. 

Five years had passed since the death of Henry the First 
— and during those five years there had been two terrible 
invasions by the people of Scotland under their King, Da- 
vid, who was at last defeated with all his army — when Ma- 
tilda, attended by her brother Robert and a large force, 
appeared in England to maintain her claim. A battle 
was fought between her troops and King Stephen’s at Lin- 
coln; in which the King himself was taken prisoner, after 
bravely fighting until his battle-axe and sword were broken, 
and was carried into strict confinement at Gloucester. 
Matilda then submitted herself to the Priests, and the 
Priests crowned her Queen of England. 

She did not long enjoy this dignity. The people of Lon- 
don had a great affection for Stephen; many of the Barons 
considered it degrading to be ruled by a woman; and the 
Queen’s temper was so haughty that she made innumerable 
enemies. The people of London revolted; and, in alliance 
with the troops of Stephen, besieged her at Winchester, 
where they took her brother Robert prisoner, whom, as her 
best soldier and chief general, she was glad to exchange for

Stephen himself, who thus regained his liberty. Then, the 
long war went on afresh. Once, she was pressed so hard 
in the Castle of Oxford, in the winter weather when the 
snow lay thick upon the ground, that her only chance of 
escape was to dress herself all in white, and, accompanied 
by no more than three faithful Knights, dressed in like 
manner that their figures might not be seen from Stephen’s 
camp as they passed over the snow, to steal away on foot, 
across the frozen Thames, walk a long distance, and at last 
gallop away on horseback. All this she did, but to no 
great purpose then; for her brother dying while the strug- 
gle was yet going on, she at last withdrew to Normandy. 

In two or three years after her withdrawal her cause ap- 
peared in England, afresh, in the person of her son Henry, 
young Plantagenet, who, at only eighteen years of age, was 
very powerful : not only on account of his mother having 
resigned all Normandy to him, but also from his having 
married Eleanor, the divorced wife of the French King, 
a bad woman, who had great possessions in France. Louis, 
the French King, not relishing this arrangement, helped 
Eustace, King Stephen’s son, to invade Normandy: but 
Henry drove their united forces out of that country, and 
then returned here, to assist his partisans, wh6m the King 
was then besieging at Wallingford upon the Thames. 
Here, for two days, divided only by the river, the two 
armies lay encamped opposite to one another — on the eve, 
as it seemed to all men, of another desperate fight, when 
the Earl of Arundel took heart and said “ that it was not 
reasonable to prolong the unspeakable miseries of two king- 
doms to minister to the ambition of two princes.” 

Many other noblemen repeating and supporting this when 
it was once uttered, Stephen and young Plantagenet went 
down, each to his own bank of the river, and held a conver- 
sation across it, in which they arranged a truce; very much 
to the dissatisfaction of Eustace, who swaggered away with 
some followers, and laid violent hands on the Abbey of 
Saint Edmund’ s-Bury, where he presently died mad. The 
trace led to a solemn council at Winchester, in which it 
was agreed that Stephen should retain the crown, on condi- 
tion of his declaring Henry his successor; that William, 
another son of the King’s, should inherit his father’s right- 
ful possessions; and that all the Crown lands which Ste- 
phen had given away should be recalled, and all the Cas-

ties he had permitted to be built demolished. Tims 
terminated the bitter war, which had now lasted fifteen 
years, and had again laid England waste. In the next 
year Stephen died, after a troubled reign of nineteen 
years* 

Although King Stephen was, for the time in which he 
lived, a humane and moderate man, with many excellent 
qualities; and although nothing worse is known of him 
than his usurpation of the Crown, which he probably ex* 
cused to himself by the consideration that King Henry the 
First was an usurper too — which was no excuse at all; the 
people of England suffered more in these dread nineteen 
years, than at any former period even of their suffering 
history. In the division of the nobility between the two 
rival claimants of the Crown, and in the growth of what is 
called the Feudal System (which made the peasants the 
bora vassals and mere slaves of the Barons), every Noble 
hod his strong Castle, where he reigned the cruel king of 
all the neighbouring people. Accordingly, he perpetrated 
whatever cruelties he chose. And never were worse cruel- 
ties committed upon earth than in wretched England in 
those nineteen years. 

The Writers who were living then desoribe them fear- 
fully. They say that the castles were filled with devils 
rather than with men; that the ]>ea sants, men and women, 
were put into dungeons for their gold and silver, were tor- 
tured with fire and smoke, were hung up by the thumbs, 
were hung up by the heels with great weights to their 
heads, were tom with jagged irons, killed with hunger, 
broken to death in narrow chests filled with sharp-pointed 
stones, murdered in countless fiendish ways. In England 
there was no corn, no meat, no cheese, no butter, there were 
no -tilled lands, no harvests. Ashes of burnt towns, and 
dreary wastes, were all that the traveller, fearful of the 
robbers who prowled abroad at all hours, would see ina 
long day’s journey; and from sunrise until night, he would 
not come upon a home. 

The clergy sometimes suffered, and heavily too, from 
pillage, but many of them had castles of their own, and 
fought in helmet and armour like the barons, and drew lots 
with other fighting men for their share of booty. The 
Pope (or Bishop of Rome), on King Stephen’s resisting his 
ambition, laid England under an Interdict at one period of

this reign; whieh means that he allowed no service to be 
performed in the churches, no couples to be married, no 
bells to be rung, no dead bodies to be buried. Any man 
fiaving the power to refuse these things, no matter whether 
he were called a Pope or a Poulterer, would, of course, 
have the power of afflicting numbers of innocent people. 
That nothing might be wanting to the miseries of King 
Stephens time, the Pope threw in this contribution to the 
public store — npt very like the widow’s contribution, as I 
think, when Our Saviour sat in Jerusalem over-against the 
Treasury, a aad she threw in two mites, which make a 

farthing.” 


CHAPTER XII. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SECOND. 

PART THE FIRST. 

Henry Plantagenet, when he was but owenty-one 
years old, quietly succeeded to the throne of England, ac- 
cording to his agreement made with the late King at Win- 
chester, Six weeks after Stephen’s death, he and his 
Queen, Eleanor, were crowned in that city; into which 
they rode on horseback in great state, side by side, amidst 
much shouting and rejoicing, and clashing of music, and 
strewing of flowers. 

| The reign of King Henry the Second began well. The 
I King had great possessions, and (what with his own 
! rights, and what with those of his wife) was lord of one- 
third part of France. He was a young man of vigour, abil- 
ity, and resolution, and immediately applied himself to re- 
i move some of the evils which had arisen in the last unhappy 
reign. He revoked all the grants of land that had been 
hastily made, on either side, during the late struggles; he 
obliged numbers of disorderly soldiers to depart from Eng- 
land; he reclaimed all the castles belonging to the Crown; 
and he forced the wicked nobles to pull down their own 
castles, to the number of eleven hundred, in which such 
dismal cruelties had been inflicted on the people. The 
King’s brother, Geoffrey, rose against him in France, 
tfhiie he was so well employed, and rendered it necessary

for him to repair to that country; where, after he had 
subdued and made a friendly arrangement with his brother 
(who did not live long), his ambition to increase his pos- 
sessions involved him in a war with the French King, 
Louis, with whom he had been on such friendly terms just 
before, that to the French King’s infant daughter, then a 
baby in the cradle, he had promised one of his little sons in 
marriage, who was a child of five years old. However, the 
war came to nothing at last, and the Pope made the two 
Kings friends again. 

Now, the clergy, in the troubles of the last reign, had 
gone on very ill indeed. There were all kinds of criminals 
among them — murderers, thieves, and vagabonds; and the 
worst of the matter was, that the good priests would not 
give up the bad priests to justice, when they committed 
crimes, but persisted in sheltering and defending them. 
The King, well knowing that there could be no peace or 
rest in England while such things lasted, resolved to reduce 
the power of the clergy; and, when he had reigned seven 
years, found (as he considered) a good opportunity for 
doing so, in the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury. 
“I will have for the new Archbishop,” thought the King, 
“ a friend in whom I can trust, who will help me to hum- 
ble these rebellious priests, and to have them dealt with, 
when they do wrong, as other men who do wrong are dealt 
with.” So, he resolved to make his favourite, the new 
Archbishop; and this favourite was so extraordinary a man, 
and his story is so curious, that I must tell you all about 
him. 

Once upon a time, a worthy merchant of London, named 
Gilbert a Becket, made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, 
and was taken prisoner by a Saracen lord. This lord, who 
treated him kindly and not like a slave, had one fair 
daughter, who fell in love with the merchant; and who told 
him that she wanted to become a Christian, and was will- 
ing to marry him if they could fly to a Christian country. 
The merchant returned her love, until he found an oppor- 
tunity to escape, when he did not trouble himself abo % ut the 
Saracen lady, but escaped with his servant Richard, who 
had been taken prisoner along with him, and arrived in 
England and forgot her. The Saracen lady, who was more 
loving than the merchant, left her father’s house in dis- 
guise to follow him, and made her way, under many hard-

ships, to the sea-shore* The merchant had taughther only 
two English words (for I suppose he must have learnt the 
Saracen tongue himself, and made love in that language), 
of which London was one, and his own name, Gilbert, 
the other. She went among the ships, saying, “London! 
London ! ” over and over again, until the sailors understood 
that she wanted to find an English vessel that would carry 
her there; so they showed her such a ship, and she paid 
for her passage with some of her jewels, and sailed away. 
Well ! The merchant was sitting in his counting-house in 
London one day, when he heard a great noise in the street; 
and presently Richard came running in from the warehouse, 
with his eyes wide open and his breath almost gone, saying, 
“ Master, master, here is the Saracen lady ! ” The mer- 
chant thought Richard was mad; but Richard said, “No, 
master! As I live, the Saracen lady is going up and down 
the city, calling Gilbert! Gilbert!” Then, he took the 
merchant by the sleeve, and pointed out at window; and 
there they saw her among the gables and water-spouts of 
the dark dirty street, in her foreign dress, so forlorn, sur- 
rounded by a wondering crowd, and passing slowly along, 
calling Gilbert, Gilbert! When the merchant saw her, 
and thought of the tenderness she had shown him in his 
captivity, and of her constancy, his heart was moved, and 
he ran down into the street; and she saw him coming, and 
with a great cry fainted in his arms. They were married 
without loss of time, and Richard (who was an excellent 
man) danced with joy the whole day of the wedding; and 
they aU lived happy ever afterwards. 

This merchant and this Saracen lady had one son, 
Thomas a Becket. He it was who became the Favourite 
of King Henry the Second. 

He had become Chancellor, when the King thought of 
making him Archbishop. He was clever, gay, well edu- 
cated, brave; had fought in several battles in France; had 
! defeated a French knight in single combat, and brought his 
I horse away as a token of the victory. He lived in a noble 
| palace, he was the tutor of the young Prince Henry, he 
was served by one hundred and forty knights, his riches 
were immense. The King once sent him as his ambassa- 
dor to France; and the French people, beholding in what 
state he travelled, cried out in the streets, “ How splendid 
must the King of England be, when this is only the Chan-

cellor! ” They had good reason to wonder at the magnifi- 
cence of Thomas a Becket, for, when he entered a French 
town, his procession was headed by two hundred and fifty 
singing boys; then, came his hounds in couples; then, 
eight waggons, each drawn by five horses driven by five 
drivers : two of the waggons filled with strong ale to be 
given away to the people; four, with his gold and silver 
plate and stately clothes; two, with the dresses of his nu- 
merous servants. Then, came twelve horses, each with a 
monkey on his back; then, a train of people bearing shields 
and leading fine war-horses splendidly equipped; then, fal- 
coners with hawks upon their wrists; then, a host of 
knights, and gentlemen and priests; then, the Chancellor 
with his brilliant garments flashing in the sun, and all the 
people capering and shouting with delight. 

The King was well pleased with all this, thinking that it 
only made himself tlie more magnificent to have so magnifi- 
cent a favourite ; but he sometimes jested with the Chan- 
cellor upon his splendour too. Once, when they were rid- 
ing together through the streets of London in hard winter 
weather, they saw a shivering old man in rags. “ Look at 
the poor object!” said the King. “ Would it not be a 
charitable act to give that aged man a comfortable warm 
cloak? ” “ Undoubtedly it would,” said Thomas k Becket, 

“and you do well, Sir, to think of such Christian duties.” 

“ Come ! ” cried the King, “ then give him your cloak ! ” It 
was made of rich crimson trimmed with ermine. The King 
tried to pull it off, the Chancellor tried to keep it on, both 
were near rolling from their saddles in the mud, when the 
Chancellor submitted, and the King gave the cloak to the 
old beggar: much to the beggar’s astonishment, and much 
to the merriment of all the courtiers in attendance. For, 
courtiers are not only eager to laugh when the King laughs, 
but they really do enjoy a laugh against a Favourite. 

“X will make,” thought King Henry the Second, “this 
Chancellor of mine, Thomas k Becket, Archbishop of Can- 
terbury# He will then be the head of the Church, and, ‘ 
being devoted to me, will help me to correct the Church. • 
He has always upheld my power against the power of the 1 
clergy, aud once publicly told some bishops (I remember), 
that men of the Church were equally bound to me with men 
of the sword. Thomas a Becket is the man, of all other 
men in England, to help me in my great design.” So the *

King, regardless of all objection, either that he was a fight- 
ing man, or a lavish man, or- a courtly man, or a man of 
pleasure, or anything but a likely man for the office, made 
him Archbishop accordingly* 

Now, Thomas a Becket was proud and loved to be fa- 
mous. He was already famous for the pomp of his life, 
for his riches, his gold and silver plate, his waggons, 
horses, and attendants. He could do no more in that way 
than he had done; and being tired of that kind of fame 
(which is a very poor one), he longed to have his name 
celebrated for something else. Nothing, he knew, would 
render him so famous in the world, as the setting of his 
utmost power and ability against the utmost power and 
ability of the King. He resolved with the whole strength 
of his mind to do it. 

He may have had some secret grudge against the King 
besides. The King may have offended his proud humour 
at some time or other, for anything I know. I think it 
likely, because it is a common thing for Kings, Princes, 
and other great people, to try the tempers of their favour- 
ites rather severely. Even the little affair of the crimson 
cloak must have been anything but a pleasant one to a 
haughty man. Thomas a Becket knew better than any one 
in England what the King expected of him. In all his 
sumptuous life, he had never yet been in a position to dis- 
appoint the King. He could take up that proud stand 
now, as head of the Church; and he determined that it 
should be written in history, either that he subdued the 
King, or that the King subdued him. 

So, of a sudden, he completely altered the whole manner 
of his life. He turned off all his brilliant followers, ate 
coarse food, drank bitter water, wore next his skin sack- 
cloth covered with dirt and vermin (for it was then 
thought very religious to be very dirty), flogged his back 
to punish himself, lived chiefly in a little cell, washed the 
feet of thirteen poor people every day, and looked as mis- 
erable as he possibly could. If he had put twelve hundred 
monkeys on horseback instead of twelve, and bad gone in 
procession with eight thousand waggons instead of eight, 
he could not have half astonished the people so much as by 
this great change. It soon caused him to be more talked 
about as an Archbishop than he had been as a Chancellor. 

The King was very angry; and was made still more so.

when the new Archbishop, claiming various estates from 
the nobles as being rightfully Church property, required 
the King himself, for the same reason, to give up Roches- 
ter Castle, and Rochester City too. Not satisfied with 
this, he declared that no power but himself should appoint 
a priest to any Church in the part of England over which 
he was Archbishop; and when a certain gentleman of Kent 
made such an appointment, as he claimed to have the right 
to do, Thomas k Becket excommunicated him. 

Excommunication was, next to the Interdict I told you 
of at the close of the last chapter, the great weapon of the 
clergy. It consisted in declaring the person who was ex- 
communicated, an outcast from the Church and from all 
religious offices; and in cursing him all over, from the top 
of his head to the sole of his foot, whether he was stand- 
ing up, lying down, sitting, kneeling, walking, running, 
hopping, jumping, gaping, coughing, sneezing, or what- 
ever else he was doing. This unchristian nonsense would 
of course have made no sort of difference to the person 
cursed — who could say his prayers at home if he were shut 
out of church, and whom none but God could judge — but 
for the fears and superstitions of the people, who avoided 
excommunicated persons, and made their lives unhappy. 
So, the King said to the New Archbishop, “ Take off this 
Excommunication from this gentleman of Kent.” To 
which the Archbishop replied, “I shall do no such thing.” 

The quarrel went on. A priest in Worcestershire com- 
mitted a most dreadful murder, that aroused the horror of 
the whole nation. The King demanded to have this wretch 
delivered up, to be tried in the same court and in the same 
way as any other murderer. The Archbishop refused, and 
kept him in the Bishop’s prison. The King, holding a sol- 
emn assembly in Westminster Hall, demanded that in fu- 
ture all priests found guilty before their Bishops of crimes 
against the law of the land should be considered priests no 
longer, and should be delivered over to the law of the land 
for punishment. The Archbishop again refused. The 
King required to know whether the clergy would obey -the 
ancient customs of the country? Every priest there, but 
one, said, after Thomas k Becket, “ Saving my order.” 
This really meant that they would only obey those customs 
when they did not interfere with their own claims; and 
the King went out of the Hall in great wrath.

Some of the clergy began to be afraid, now, that they 
were going too far. Though Thomas a Beeket was other- 
wise as unmoved as Westminster Hall, they prevailed upon 
him, for the sake of their fears, to go to the King at Wood- 
stock, and promise to observe the ancient customs of the 
country, without saying anything about his order. The 
King received this submission favourably, and summoned 
a great council of the clergy to meet at the Castle of Clar- 
endon, by Salisbury. But when the council met, the Arch- 
bishop again insisted on the words “ saving my order ; 99 and 
he still insisted, though lords entreated him, and priests 
wept before him and knelt to him, and an adjoining room 
was thrown open, filled with armed soldiers of the King, 
to threaten him. At length he gave way, for that time, 
and the ancient customs (which included what the King 
had demanded in vain) were stated in writing, and were 
signed and sealed by the chief of the clergy, and were 
called the Constitutions of Clarendon. 

The quarrel went on, for all that. The Archbishop tried 
to see the King. The King would not see him. The 
Archbishop tried to escape from England. The sailors on 
the coast would launch no boat to take him away. Then, 
he again resolved to do his worst in opposition to the King, 
and began openly to set the ancient customs at defiance. 

The King summoned him before a great council at 
Northampton, where he accused him of high treason, and 
made a claim against him, which was not a just one, for an 
enormous sum of money. Thomas A Beeket was alone 
against the whole assembly, and the very Bishops advised 
him to resign his offioe and abandon his contest with the 
King. His great anxiety and agitation stretched him on a 
sick-bed for two days, but he was still undaunted. He 
went to the adjourned council, carrying a great cross in his 
right hand, and sat down holding it erect before him. The 
King angrily retired into an inner room. The whole as- 
sembly angrily retired and left him there. But there he 
sat. The Bishops came out again in a body, and renounced 
him as a traitor. He only said, “ I hear ! 99 and sat there 
still. They retired again into the inner room, and his trial 
proceeded without him. By -and- bye, the Earl of Leices- 
ter, heading the barons, came out to read his sentence. 
He refused to hear it, denied the power of the court, and 
said he would refer his cause to the Pope. As he walked

out of the hall, with the cross in his hand, some of those 
present picked ujb rushes — rushes were strewn upon the 
floors m those days by way of carpet— and threw them at 
him. He proudly turned his head, and said that were he 
not Archbishop, he would chastise those cowards with the 
sword he had known how to use in bygone days. He then 
mounted his horse, and rode away, cheered and surrounded 
by the common people, to whom he threw open his house 
that night and gave a supper, supping with them himself. 
That same night he secretly departed from the town; and 
so, travelling by night and hiding by day* and calling him- 
self “ Brother Dearman,” got away, not without difficulty, 
to Flanders. 

The struggle still went on. The angry King took pos- 
session of the revenues of the archbishopric, and banished 
all the relations and servants of Thomas k Becket, to the 
number of four hundred. The Pope and the French King 
both protected him, and an abbey was assigned for his res- 
idence. Stimulated by this support, Thomas k Bucket, on 
a great festival day, formally proceeded to a great churCli 
crowded with people, and going up into the pulpit publicly 
cursed and excommunicated all who had supported the Con- 
stitutions of Clarendon : mentioning many English noble- 
men by name, and not distantly hinting at the King of 
England himself. 

When intelligence of this new affront was carried to the 
King in his chamber, his passion was so furious that he 
tore his clothes, and rolled like a madman on his bed of 
straw and rushes. But he was soon up and doing. He 
ordered all the ports and coasts of England to be narrowly 
watched, that no letters of Interdict might be brought into 
the kingdom; and sent messengers and bribes to the Pope's 
palace at Rome. Meanwhile, Thomas k Becket, for his part, 
was not idle at Rome, but constantly employed his utmost 
arts in his own behalf. Thus the contest stood, until there 
was peace between France and England (which had been for 
some time at war), and until the two children of the two 
Kings were married in celebration of it. Then, the French 
King brought about a meeting between Henry and his old 
favourite, so long his enemy. 

Even then, though Thomas k Becket knelt before the 
King, he was obstinate and immovable as to those words 
about his order. King Louis of France was weak enough

in bis venetation fdr Thomas k Becket and such men, but 
this was a little too mudh for him. He said that k Becket 
“ wanted to be greater than the saints and better than St. 
Petef,” and rode away from him with the King of Ehg 1 
land. His poor French Majesty asked k Becket’ s pardon 
for so doing, however, soon afterwards, and out a very piti- 
ful figure. 

At last* and after a world of trouble, it came to this. 
Thefe was another meeting on French gtoUnd between King 
Henry arid Thomas * a Becket, and it was agreed that 
Thomas k Becket should be ArOhbishbp of Canterbury, ac- 
cording to the customs of former Archbishops, Uhd that the 
King should put him in possession of the revenues Of that 
post. And now, indeed, you might suppose the struggle 
at an end, and Thomas a Becket at rest. No, not even yet. 
fror Thomas k Becket hearing, by soine means, that King 
Henry, When he was in dread of his kingdom being placed 
under an interdict, had had his eldest son Prihce Henry 
secretly crowned, not only persuaded the Pope to suspend 
the Archbishop of York who had performed that ceremony, 
and to excommunicate the Bishops Who had assisted at it, 
but Sent a messenger Of his own into Englhnd, in Spite of 
all the King’s precautions along the coast, who delivered 
the letters Of excommunication into the Bishops’ own 
hands. Thomas k Becket then came over to England him- 
self, after an absence of seven years. He was privately 
warned that it wafc dangerous to cbme, and that an ireful

he, then and there, excommunicated three of his enemies, 
of whom Ranulf de Broc the ireful knight was one. 

As men in general had no fancy for being cursed, in their 
sitting and walking, and gaping and sneezing, and all the 
rest of it, it was very natural in the persons so freely ex- 
communicated to complain to the King. It was equally 
natural in the King, who had hoped that this troublesome 
opponent was at last quieted, to fall into a mighty rage 
when he heard of these new affronts; and, on the Arch- 
bishop of York telling him that he never could hope for 
rest while Thomas k Becket lived, to cry out hastily before 
his court, “ Have I no one here who will deliver me from 
this man? ” There were four knights present* who, hear- 
ing the King’s words, looked at one another, and went out. 

The names of these knights were, Reginald Fitzukse, 
William Tracy, Hugh de Morville, and Richard 
Brito; three of whom had been in the train of Thomas k 
Becket in the old days of his splendour. They rode away 
on horseback, in a very secret manner, and on the third 
day after Christmas Day arrived at Saltwood House, not 
far from Canterbury, which belonged to the family of Ran- 
ulf de Broc. They quietly collected some followers here, 
in case they should need any; and proceeding to Canter- 
bury, suddenly appeared (the four knights and twelve men) 
before the Archbishop, in his own house, at two o’clock in 
the afternoon. They neither bowed nor spoke, but sat 
down on the floor in silence, staring at the Archbishop. 

Thomas k Becket said, at length, “ What do you want? ” 

“We want,” said Reginald Fitzurse, “the excommuni- 
cation taken from the Bishops, and you to answer for your 
offences to the King.” 

Thomas k Becket defiantly replied, that the power of the 
clergy was above the power of the King. That it was not 
for such men as they were, to threaten him. That if he 
were threatened by all the swords in England, he would 
never yield. 

“ Then we will do more than threaten ! ” said the knights. 
And they went out with the twelve men, and put on their 
armour, and drew their shining swords, and came back. 

His servants, in the meantime, had shut up and barred 
the great gate of the palace. At first, the knights tried to 
shatter it with their battle-axes; but, being shown a win- 
dow by which they could enter, they let the gate alone,

and climbed in that way. While they were battering at 
the door, the attendants of Thomas k Becket had implored 
him to take refage in the Cathedral; in which, as a sanctu- 
ary or sacred place, they thought the knights would dare 
to do no violent deed. He told them, again and again, 
that he would not stir. Hearing the distant voices of the 
monks singing the evening service, however, he said it was 
now his duty to attend, and therefore, and for no other 
reason, he would go. 

There was a near way between his Palace and the Cathe- 
dral, by some beautiful old cloisters which you may yet 
see. He went into the Cathedral, without any hurry, and 
having the Cross carried before him as usual. When he 
was safely there, his servants would have fastened the 
door, but he Baid No ! it was the house of Cod and not a 
fortress. 

As he spoke, the shadow of Reginald Fitzurse appeared 
in the Cathedral doorway, darkening the little light there 
was outside, on the dark winter evening. This knight 
said, in a strong voice, “ Follow me, loyal servants of the 
King ! 99 The rattle of the armour of the other knights 
echoed through the Cathedral, as they came clashing in. 

It was so dark, in the lofty aisles and among the stately 
pillars of the church, and there were so many hiding-places 
in the crypt below and in the narrow passages above, that 
Thomas a Beeket might even at that pass have saved him- 
self if he would. But he would not. He told the monks 
resolutely that he would not. And though they all dis- 
persed and left him there with no other follower than Ed- 
ward Gryme, his faithful cross-bearer, he was as firm 
then, as ever he had been in his life. 

The knights came on, through the darkness, making a 
terrible noise with their armed tread upon the stone pave- 
ment of the church. “ Where is the traitor ? 99 they cried 
out. He made no answer. But when they cried, “ Where 
is the Archbishop ? 99 he said proudly, “ I am here 1 99 and 
came out of the shade and stood before them. 

The knights had no desire to kill him, if they could rid 
the King and themselves of him by any other means. 
They told him he must either fly or go with them. He 
said he would do neither; and he threw William Tracy off 
with such force when he took hold of hid sleeve, that Tracy 

reeled again. By H and his steadiness, he so

incensed them, and exasperated their fierce humour, that 
Reginald Fitzurse, whom he called by an ill name, said, 
“Then die!” and struck at his head. But the faithful 
Edward Gryme put out his arm, and there received the 
main force of the blow, so that it only made his master 
bleed. Another voice from among the knights again 
called to Thomas k Becket to fly; but, with his blood run- 
ning down his face, and his hands clasped, and his head 
bent, he commended himself to God, and stood firm. Then 
they cruelly killed him close to the altar of St. Bennet; 
and his body fell upon the pavement, which was dirtied 
'with his blood and brains. 

It is an awful thing to think of the murdered mortal, 
who had so showered his curses about, lying, all disfigured, 
in the church, where a few lamps here and there were but 
red specks on a pall of darkness; and to think of the 
guilty knights riding away on horseback, looking over their 
shoulders at the dim Cathedral, and remembering what 
they had left inside. 


PART THE SECOND. 

When the King heard how Thomas k Becket had lost his 
life in Canterbury Cathedral, through the ferocity of the 
four Knights, he was filled with dismay. Some have sup- 
posed that when the King spoke those hasty words, " Have 
I no one here who will deliver me from this man? ” he 
wished, and meant a Becket to be slain. But few things 
are more unlikely; for, besides that the King was not nat- 
urally cruel (though very passionate), he was wise, and 
must have known full well what any stupid man in his 
dominions must have known, namely, that such a murder 
would rouse the Pope and the whole Church against him. 

He sent respectful messengers to the Pope, to represent 
his innocence (except in having uttered the hasty words); 
and he swore solemnly and publicly to his innocence, and 
contrived in time to make his peace. As to the four guilty 
Knights, who fled into Yorkshire, and never again dared to 
show themselves at Court, the Pope excommunicated them; 
and they lived miserably for some time, shunned by all 
their countrymen. .At last, they went humbly to Jerusa- 
lem as a penance, and there died and were buried. 

It .happened, fortunately for the pacifying of the Pope,

that an opportunity arose Very soon after the murder of & 
Becket, for the King to declare his power in Ireland — which 
was an acceptable undertaking to the Pope, as the Irish, 
who had been converted to Christianity by one Patricius 
(otherwise Saint Patrick) long ago, before any Pope exist* 
ed, considered that the Pope had nothing at all to do with 
them, or they with the Pope, and accordingly refused to 
pay him Peter’s Pence, or that tax of a penny a house 
which I have elsewhere mentioned. The King’s opportu- 
nity arose in this way. 

The Irish were, at that time, as barbarous a people as 
you can well imagine. They were continually quarrelling 
and fighting, cutting one another’s throats, slicing one an- 
other’s noses, burning one another’s houses, carrying away 
one another’s wives, and committing all sorts of violence. 
The country was divided into five kingdoms— Desmond, 
Thomond, Connaught, Ulster, and Leinster— each gov- 
erned by a separate King, of whom one claimed to be the 
chief of the rest. How, one of these Kings, named Der- 
mond Mac Mukrough (a wild kind of name, spelt in more 
than on© wild kind of way), had carried off the wife of a 
friend of his, and concealed her on an island in a bog. The 
friend resenting this (though it was quite the custom of the 
country), complained to the chief King, and, with the chief 
King’s help, drove Dermond Mac Murrough out of his do- 
minions. Dermond came over to England for revenge! ; and 
offered to hold his realm as a vassal of King Henry, if 
King Henry would help him to regain it. The King con- 
sented to these terms; but only assisted him, then, with 
what were called Letters Patent, authorising any English 
subjects who were so disposed, to enter into his service, 
and aid his cause. 

There was, at Bristol, a certain Eari» Ricrakd de 
Clare, called Strongbow; of no very good character; 
needy and desperate, and ready for anything that offered 
him a chance of improving his fortunes. There were, in 
South Wales, two other broken knights of the same good- 
for-nothing sort, called Robert Fit^Stephen, and Mau- 
rice Fitz-Gerald. These three, each with a small band 
of followers, took up Dermond’s cause; and itwasagreed 
that if it proved successful, Strongbow should marry Der* 
mond’s daughter Eva, and be declared his heir. 

The trained English followers of these knights were so

superior in all the discipline of battle to the * Irish, that 
they beat them against immense superiority of numbers. 
In one fight, early in the war, they cut off three hundred 
heads, and laid them before Mac Murrough; who turned 
them every one up with his hands, rejoicing, and, coming 
to one which was the head of a man whom he had much 
disliked, grasped it by the hair and ears, and tore off the 
nose and lips with his teeth. You may judge from this, 
what kind of a gentleman an Irish King in those times was. 
The captives, all through this war, were horribly treated; 
the victorious party making nothing of breaking their 
limbs, and casting them into the sea from the tops of high 
rocks. It was in the midst of the miseries and cruelties 
attendant on the taking of Waterford, where the dead lay 
piled in the streets, and the filthy gutters ran with blood, 
that Strongbow married Eva. An odious marriage-com- 
pany those mounds of corpses must have made, I think, 
and one quite worthy of the young lady’s father. 

He died, after Waterford and Dublin had been taken, 
and various successes achieved; and Strongbow became 
King of Leinster. Now came King Henry’s opportunity. 
To restrain the growing power of Strongbow, he himself 
repaired to Dublin, as Strongbow’ s Royal Master, and de- 
prived him of his kingdom, but confirmed him in the enjoy- 
ment of great possessions. The King, then, holding state 
in Dublin, received the homage of nearly all the Irish 
Kings and Chiefs, and so came home again with a great 
addition to his reputation as Lord of Ireland, and with a 
new claim on the favour of the Pope. And now, their rec- 
onciliation was completed — more easily and mildly by the 
Pope, than the King might have expected, I think. 

At this period of his reign, when his troubles seemed so 
few and his prospects so bright, those domestic miseries 
began which gradually made the King the most unhappy 
of men, reduced his great spirit, wore away his health, and 
broke his heart. 

He had four sons. Henry, now aged eighteen — his se- 
cret crowning of whom had given such offence to Thomas & 
Becket; Richard, aged sixteen; Geoffrey, fifteen; and 
John, his favourite, a young boy whom the courtiers named 
Lackland, because he had no inheritance, but to whom 
the King meant to give the Lordship of Ireland. All 
these misguided boys, in their turn, were unnatural sons to

him, and unnatural brothers to each other. Prince Henry, 
stimulated by the French King, and by his bad mother, 
Queen Eleanor, began the un dutiful history. 

First, he demanded that his young wife, Margaret, the 
French King’s daughter, should be crowned as well as he. 
His father, the King, consented, and it was done. It was 
no sooner done, than he demanded to have a part of his 
father’s dominions, during his father’s life. This being 
refused, he made off from his father in the night, with his 
bad heart full of .bitterness, and took refuge at the French 
King’s Court. Within a day or two, his brothers Richard 
and Geoffrey followed. Their mother tried to join them — 
escaping in man’s clothes — but she was seized by King 
Henry’s men, and immured in prison, where she lay, de- 
servedly, for sixteen years. Every day, however, some 
grasping English noblemen, to whom the King’s protection 
of his people from their avarice and oppression had given 
offence, deserted him and joined the Princes. Every day 
he heard some fresh intelligence of the Princes levying ar- 
mies against him; of Prince Henry’s wearing a crown be- 
fore his own ambassadors at the French Court, and being 
called the Junior King of England; of all the Princes 
swearing never to make peace with him, their father, with- 
out the consent and approval of the Barons of France. 
But, with his fortitude and energy unshaken, King Henry 
met the shock of these disasters with a resolved and cheer- 
ful face. He called upon all Royal fathers who had sons, 
to help him, for his cause was theirs; he hired, out of his 
riches, twenty thousand men to fight the false French 
King, who stirred his own blood against him; and he car- 
ried on the war with such vigour, that Louis soon proposed 
a conference to treat for peace. 

The conference was held beneath an old wide-spreading 
green elm-tree, upon a plain in France. It led to nothing. 
The war recommenced. Prince Richard began his fighting 
career, by leading an army against his father; but his 
father beat him and his. army back; and thousands of his 
men would have rued the day in which they fought in such 
a wicked cause, had not the King received news of an in- 
vasion of England by the Scots, and promptly come home 
through a great storm to repress it. And whether he 
really began to fear that he suffered these troubles because 
k Beoket had been murdered; or whether he wished to rise

in Hie favour of the Pope, who had now declared k Becket 
to be a saint, or ip the favour of his own people, of whom 
many believed that even k Becket’ s senseless tomb could 
work miracles, I don’t know: but the King nq sooner 
landed in England than he went straight to Canterbury; 
and when he came within sight of the distant Cathedral, 
he dismounted from his horse, took off his shoes, and 
walked with bare and bleeding feet to & Becket’s grave. 
There, he lay down on the ground, lamenting, in the pres- 
ence of many people; and by-and-bye he went into the 
Chapter House, and, removing his clothes from his back 
and shoulders, submitted himself to be beaten \vith knotted 
cords (not beaten very hard, I dare say though) by eighty 
Prieste, one after another. It chanced that on the very 
day when the King made this curious exhibition of him- 
self, a complete victory was obtained over the (Scots; which 
very much delighted the Priests, who said that it was won 
beacuse of his great example of repentance. For the 
Priepts in general had found out, since k Becket's death, 
that they admired him of all things — though they had 
hated him very cordially when he was alive. 

The Earl of Flandprs, who was at the head of the base 
conspiracy of the King’s undutiful sons and their foreign 
friends, took the opportunity of the King being thus emr 
ployed at home, to lay siege to Rouen, the capital of Jfor- 
mandy. But the King, who was extraordinarily quick and 
active in all his movements, was at Rouen, too, before it 
was supposed possible that he could have left England; 
and there he so defeated the said Earl of Flanders, that the 
conspirators proposed peace, and his bad sons Henry and 
Geoffrey submitted. Richard resisted for six weeks; but, 
being beaten out of castle after castle, he at last submitted 
too, and his father forgave him. 

To forgive these unworthy pripces was only to afford 
them breathing-time for new faithlessness. They were so 
false, disloyal, and dishonourable, that they were up more 
to be trusted than common thieves. In the very next year, 
Prince Henry rebelled again, and was again forgiven. In 
eight years more, Prince Richard rebelled against his elder 
brother; and Prinoe Geoffrey infamously said that the 
brothers could never agree yre 11 together, unless they were 
united against their father. In the very next year after 
their reconciliation by the King, Prince Henry again re*

belled against his father; and again submitted, swearing to 
be true; and was fcgaiii forgiven; and again rebelled With 
Geoffrey* 

But the eiid of this perfidious Prince was come* He fell 
sick at a French town; and his conscience terribly re- 
proaching him with his baseness, he sent messengdrs to the 
King his father, imploring hitn to eonle arid see him} and 
to forgive him for the last tilde on his bed of deaths The 
generous Killg, who had a royal and fof giving mind towards 

I his children always, would have gone; but this Prinoe had 
been so unnatural, that the noblemeh about the King sus- 
pected treachery, and represented to him that he could not 
safely trust his life with such a traitor, though his own 
eldest son. Therefore the King sent him a ling from off 
his finger as a token of forgiveness; and when the Prince 
had kissed it, with much grief mid many tearh, ahd had 
confessed to those around him how bad, and wicked, and 
nndutiful a son he had been; he said to the attendant 
Priests; “O, tie a rope about my body, and draw me out 
of bed, and lay me down upon a bed of ashes* that I may 
die with pfayers to God in a repentant manner ! 99 And so 
he died, at twenty-seven years old 

Three years afterwards, Prince Geoffrey, being urihorsed 
at a tournament, had his brains trampled out by a crowd 
of horses passing over him . So* there only remained Prince 
Richard, and Prince John — who had grown to be a young 
man now, and had solemnly sworn to be faithful to his 
father. Richard soon rebelled again, encouraged by his 
friend the French King, Philip t ha Sbcond (son of Louis, 
who was dead); arid soon submitted and was again forgiven, 
swearing on the New Testament never to rebel again; and 
in another year or so, rebelled again; and, in the presence 
of his father, knelt down on his knee before the King of 
France; and did the French Kirig homage; and declared 
that with hiB aid he would possess himself* by force, of all 
his fathers French dominions;

Sick at heart, wearied out by the falsehood of his sons, 
and almost ready to lie down and die, the unhappy King 
who had so long stood firm, began to fail. But the Pope, 
to his honour, supported him; and obliged the French 
King and Richard, though successful in fight, to treat for 
peace. Richard wanted to be crowned King of England, 
and pretended that he wanted to be married (which he 
really did not) to the French King’s sister, his promised 
wife, whom King Henry detained in England. King 
Henry wanted, on the other hand, that the French King’s 
sister should be married to his favourite son, J ohn : the only 
one of his sons (he said) who had never rebelled against 
him. At last King Henry, deserted by his nobles one by 
one, distressed, exhausted, broken-hearted, consented to 
establish peace. 

One final heavy sorrow was reserved for him, even yet. 
When they brought him the proposed treaty of peace, in 
writing, as he lay very ill in bed, they brought him also 
the list of the deserters from their allegiance, whom he 
was required to pardon. The first name upon this list was 
John, his favourite son in whom he had trusted to the 
last. 

“ O John ! child of my heart ! ” exclaimed the King, in a 
great agony of mind. “ O John, whom I have loved the 
best! O John, for whom I have contended through these 
many troubles ! Have you betrayed me too ! ” And then 
he lay down with a heavy groan, and said, “ Now let the 
world go as it will. I care for nothing more ! ” 

After a time, he told his attendants to take him to the 
French town of Chinon — a town he had been fond of, dur- 
ing many years. But he was fond of no place now; it 
was too true that he could care for nothing more upon this 
earth. He wildly cursed the hour when he was bom, and 
cursed the children whom he left behind him; and expired. 

As, one hundred years before, the servile followers of 
the Court had abandoned the Conqueror in the hour of his 
death, so they now abandoned his descendant. The very 
body was stripped, in the plunder of the Royal chamber; 
and it was not easy to find the means of carrying it for 
burial to the abbey church of Fontevraud. 

Richard was said in after years, by way of flattery, to 
have the heart of a Lion. It would have been far better ^ 
I think, to have had the heart of a Man. His heart, whatr

ever it was, had cause to beat remorsefully within his 
breast, when he came — as he did — into the solemn abbey, 
and looked on his dead father’s uncovered face. His 
heart, whatever it was, had been a black and perjured 
heart, in all its dealings with the deceased King, and more 
deficient in a single touch of tenderness than any wild 
beast’s in the forest. 

There is a pretty story told of this Reign, called the 
story of Fair Rosamond. It relates how the King doted 
on Fair Rosamond, who was the loveliest girl in all the 
t world; and how he had a beautiful Bower built for her in 
a Park at Woodstock; and how it was erected in a laby- 
rinth, and could only be found by a clue of. silk. .How: 
the bad Queen Eleanor, becoming jealous of Fair Rosa- 
mond, found out the secret of the clue, and one day, ap- 
peared before her, with a dagger and a cup of poison, and 
. left her to the choice between those deaths. How Fair 
j Rosamond, after shedding many piteous tears and offering 
i many useless prayers to the cruel Queen, took the poison, 
and fell dead in the midst of the beautiful bower, while 
the unconscious birds sang gaily all around her. 

Now, there was a fair Rosamond and she was (I dare 
; say) the loveliest girl in all the world, and the King was 
certainly very fond of her, and the bad Queen Eleanor was 
certainly made jealous. But I am afraid — I say afraid, be- 
cause I like the story so much — that there was no bower, 
no labyrinth, no silken clue, no dagger, no poison. I am 
afraid fair Rosamond retired to a nunnery near Oxford, 

■ and died there, peaceably; her sister-nuns hanging a silken 
drapery over her tomb, and often dressing it with flowers, 
in remembrance of the youth and beauty that had enchanted 
the King when he too was young, and when his life lay 
fair before him. 

It was dark and ended now; faded and gone. Henry 
Plantagenet lay quiet in the abbey church of Fontevraud, 
in the fifty-seventh year of his age — never to be completed 
—after governing England well, for nearly thirty-five 
years.

CHAPTER XIII. 

ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE FIRST, CALLED THE 
LION-HEART. 

' In the year of our Lord one thousand one hundred and 
eighty-nine, Richard of the Lion Heart succeeded to the 
throne of King Henry the Second, whose paternal heart he 
had done so much to break. He had been, as we have 
seen, a rebel from his boyhood; but, the moment he be- 
came a king against whom others might rebel, he found 
out that rebellion was a great wickedness. In the heat of 
this pious discovery, he punished all the leading people 
who had befriended him against his father. He could 
scarcely have done anything that would have been a better 
instance of his real nature, or a better warning to fawners 
and parasites not to trust in lion-hearted princes. 

He likewise put his late father's treasurer in chains, and 
locked him up in a dungeon from which he was not set free 
until he had relinquished, not only all the Crown treasure, 
but all his own money too. So, Richard certainly got the 
Lion's share of the wealth of this wretched treasurer, 
whether he had a Lion's heart or not. 

He was crowned King of England, with great pomp, at 
Westminster : walking to the Cathedral under a silken can- 
opy stretched on the tops of four . lances, each carried by a 
great lord. On the day of his coronation, a dreadful mur- 
dering of the Jews took place, which seems to have given 
great delight to numbers of savage persons calling them- 
selves Christians. The King had issued a proclamation 
forbidding the Jews (who were generally hated, though 
they were the most useful merchants in England)to appear 
at the ceremony; but as they had assembled in London from 
all parts* bringing presents to show their respect for the 
new Sovereign, some of them ventured down to Westmin- 
ster Hall with their gifts; which were very readily accept- 
ed. It is supposed, now, that some noisy fellow in Hie 
crowd, pretending to be a very delicate Christian, set up a 
howl at this, and struck a Jew who was trying to get in at 
the HaU door with his present. A riot arose. The Jews

who had got Into the Hall, were driven forth; and some of 
the rabble cried out that the new King had commanded the 
unbelieving race to be put to death. Thereupon the Crowd 
rushed through the narrow streets of the city, slaughtering 
all the Jews they met; and when they could find no more 
out of doors (on account of their having fied to their houses, 
and fastened themselves in), they ran madly about, break- 
ing open all the houses where the Jews lived, rushing in 
and stabbing or spearing them, sometimes even flinging old 
people and children out of window into blazing fires they 
had lighted up below. This, great cruelty lasted four* 
and-twenty hours, and only three men were punished for 
it. Even they forfeited their lives not for murdering and 
robbing the Jews* but for burning the houses of some 
Christians. 

King Richard, who was a strong restless burly man, with 
one idea always in his head, and that the very troublesome 
idea of breaking the heads of other men, was mightily im- 
patient to go on a Crusade to the Holy Land, with a great 
army. As great armies could not be raised to go, even to 
the Holy Land, without a great, deal of money, he sold the 
Crown domains, and even the high offices of State; reck- 
lessly appointing noblemen to rule over bis English sub- 
jects, not because they were fit to govern, but because they 
could pay high for the privilege. In this way, and by 
selling pardons at a dear rate, and by varieties of avarice 
and oppression, he scraped together a large treasure. He 
then appointed two Bishops to take care of his kingdom in 
his absence, and gave great powers and possessions to his 
brother John, to secure his friendship. John would rather 
have been made Regent of England; but he Was a sly man, 
and friendly to the expedition; saying to himself, no doubt, 
“The more fighting, the more chance of my brother being 
killed; and when he is killed, then I become King John ! ” 

Before the newly levied army departed from England* 
the recruits and the general populace distinguished them- 
selves by astonishing cruelties on the unfortunate Jews: 
whom, in many large towns, they murdered by hundreds 
in the most horrible manner. 

At York, a large body of Jews took refuge in the Gdstle, 
in the absence of its Governor, after the wives and children 
of many of them had been slain before their eyes. , Pres- 
ently came the Governor, and demanded admission.. “ How

can we give it thee, 0 Governor ! 99 said the Jews upon the 
walls, “ when, if we open the gate by so much as the width 
of a foot, the roaring crowd behind thee wiU press in and 
kill us? ” 

Upon this, the unjust Governor became angry, and told 
the people that he approved of their killing those Jews; 
and a mischievous maniac of a friar, dressed all in white, 
put himself at the head of the assault, and they assaulted 
the Castle for three days. 

Then said Jocen, the head-Jew (who was a rabbi or 
Priest), to the rest, “ Brethren, there is no hope for us with 
the Christians who are hammering at the gates and walls, 
and who must soon break in. As we and our wives and 
children must die, either by Christian hands, or by our own, 
let it be by our own. Let us destroy by fire what jewels 
and other treasure we have here, then fire the castle, and 
then perish ! ” 

A few could not resolve to do this, but the greater part 
complied. They made a blazing heap of all their valuables, 
and, when those were consumed, set the castle in flames. 
While the flames roared and crackled around them, and 
shooting up into the sky turned it blood-red, Jocen cut the 
throat of his beloved wife, and stabbed himself. All the 
others who had wives or children, did the like dreadful 
deed. When the populace broke in, they found (except the 
trembling few, cowering in corners, whom they soon killed) 
only heaps of greasy cinders, with here and there some- 
thing like part of the blackened trunk of a burnt tree, but 
which had lately been a human creature, formed by the 
beneficent hand of the Creator as they were. 

After this bad beginning, Richard and his troops went 
on, in no very good manner, with the Holy Crusade. It 
was undertaken jointly by the King of England and his old 
friend Philip of France. They commenced the business by 
reviewing their forces, to the number of one hundred thou- 
sand men. Afterwards, they severally embarked their 
troops for Messina, in Sicily, which was appointed as the 
next place of meeting. 

King Richard’s sister had married the King of this place, 
but he was dead : and his uncle Tancred had usurped the 
crown, cast the Royal Widow into prison, and possessed 
himself of her estates. Richard fiercely demanded liis sis- 
ter’s release, the restoiation of her lands, and (according

to the Royal custom of the Island) that she should have a 
golden chair, a golden table, four-and-twenty silver cups, 
and four-and-twenty silver dishes. As he was too power- 
ful to be successfully resisted, Tancred yielded to his de- 
mands; and then the Frenoh King grew jealous, and com- 
plained that the English King wanted to be absolute in the 
Island of Messina and everywhere else. Richard, how- 
| ever, cared little or nothing for this complaint; and in con- 
I* sideration of a present of twenty thousand pieces of gold, 

| promised his pretty little nephew Arthur, then a child of 
two years old, in marriage to Tancred’ s daughter. We 
shall hear again of pretty little Arthur by-and-bye. 

; This Sicilian affair arranged without anybody’s brains 
being knocked out (which must have rather disappointed 
him), King Richard took his sister away, and also a fair 
lady named Berengaria, with whom he had fallen in love 
in France, and whom his mother, Queen Eleanor (so long 
in prison, you remember, but released by Richard cm his 
coming to the Throne), had brought out there to be his 
wife; and sailed with them for Cyprus. 

He soon had the pleasure of fighting the King of the 
Island of Cyprus, for allowing his subjects to pillage some 
of the English troops who were shipwrecked on the shore; 
and easily conquering this poor monarch, he seized his only 
daughter, to be a companion to the lady Berengaria, and 
put the King himself into silver fetters. He then sailed 
away again with his mother, sister, wife, and the captive 
princess; and soon arrived before the town of Acre, which 
the French King with his fleet was besieging from Hie sea. 
But the French King was in no triumphant condition, for 
his army had been thinned by the swords of the Saracens, 
and wasted by the plague ; and Saladin, the brave Sultan 
of the Turks, at the head of a numerous army, was at that 
time gallantly defending the place from the hills that rise 
above it. 

Wherever the united army of Crusaders went, they 
agreed in few points except in gaming, drinking, and quar- 
relling, in a most unholy manner; in debauching the peo- 
ple among whom they tarried, whether they were friends 
or foes; and in carrying disturbance and ruin into quiet 
places. The French King was jealous of the English King, 
and the English King was jealous of the French King, and 
the disorderly and violent soldiers of the two nations were

jealous of one another; consequently, the two Kings could 
not at first agree, even upon a joint assault pn Acre; but 
when they did make up their quarrel for that purpose, tbs ; 
Saracens promised to yield the town, to give up to the Chris- 
tians the wood of the Holy Cross, to set at liberty all their 
Christian captives, and to pay two hundred thousand pieces 
of gold. All this was to he done within forty days; but, 
not being done, King Richard ordered some three thousand 
Saracen prisoners to be brought out in the front of his 
Camp, and there, in full view of their own countrymen, to 
be butchered. 

The French King had no part in this crime; fpr fie was 
by that time travelling homeward with the greater part of 
his men; being offended by the overbearing conduct of the 
English King; being anxious to look after his own domin- 
ions; and being ill, besides, from the unwholesome air of 
that hot and sandy country. King Richard carried on the 
war without him j and remained in the. East, meeting with 
a Variety of adventures, nearly a year and a half. Every 
night when his army was on the march, and came to a halt, 
the heralds cried opt three times, to remind all the soldiers 
of the cause in which they were engaged, “ gave the Holy 
Sepulchre ! M and then all the soldiers knelt and said 
“ Amen ! ” Marching or encamping, the army had continu- 
ally to Strive with the hot air of the glaring desert, or with 
the Saracen soldiers animated and directed by the brave 
Saladin, or with both together. Sickness and death, battle 
afcd wounds, were always among them; but through every 
difficulty King Richard fought like a giant, and worked 
like a common labourer. Long and long after be was quiet 
in his grave, his terrible battle-axe, with twenty English 
pounds of English steel in its mighty head, wan a legend 
among the Saracens; and when all the Saracen and Chris- 
tian hosts had been dust for many a year, if a Saracen 
horse started at any object by the wayside, his rider would 
exclaim, What dost thou fear, Fool? Dost thou think 
King Richard is behind it? ” 

No one admired this King’s renown for bravery more 
than Saladin himself, who ’was a generous and gallant ene- 
my. When Richard lay ill of a fever, Saladin sent him 
fresh fruits from Damascus, and snow from the mountain^ 
tops. Courtly messages and compliments were frequently 
exchanged between them— and then King Richard would

mount his horse and kill as many Saracens as he could; 
and Saladin would mount his, and kill as many Christians 
as he could. In this way King Richard fought to hid 
heart's content at Arsoof and at Jaffa; and finding himself 
with nothing exciting to do at Asoalon, except to rebuild, 
for his own defence, some fortifications there which the 
Saracens had destroyed, he kicked his ally the Duke of 
, Austria, for being too proud to work at theta. 

The army at last came within sight of the Holy City of 
Jerusalem; but, being then a mere nest of jealoiisy, and 
quarrelling and fighting, soon retired, and agreed with the 
Saracens upon a truce for three years, three months, three 
days, and three hours. Then, the English Christians, pro- 
tected by the noble Saladin from Saracen revenge, visited 
Our Saviour’s tomb; and then King Riehard embanked 
with a small force at Acre to return home. 

But h© was shipwrecked in the Adriatic Sea, and was 
fain to pass through Germany, under an assumed name. 
Now, there were many people in Germany who had served 
in the Holy Land under that proud Duke of Austria who 
had been kicked; and Some of them, easily recognising a 
man so remarkable as King Richard, carried their intellir 
1 genoe to the kicked Duke, who straightway took him pris- 
oner at a little ipu near Vienna. 

The Duke’s master the Emperor of Germany, and thef 
King of France, were equally delighted to have so trouble?* 
f 8<nne a monarch in safe keeping. Friendships which are 
founded on a partnership in doing wrong, are never true; 
and the King of France was now quite as heartily King 
I Richard’ a foe, as he had ever been his friend in his unnat^ 

| ural conduct to his father. He monstrously pretended that 
1 King Richard had designed to poison him in the East; he 
charged him with having pm*ddred, there, a man whom he 
had in truth befriended; he bribed the Emperor of Ger- 
many to keep him close prisoner; and, finally, through the 
plotting of these two princes, Richard was brought before 
the German legislature, charged with the foregoing crimes, 
and many others. But he defended himself so wellj that 
many of the assembly were moved to tears by his eloquence 
and earnestness. It was decided that he shquld be treated, 
during the rest of his captivity, in a manner more becoming 
his dignity than he had been, and that he should be set 
free on the payment of a heavy ransom. This ransom the

English people willingly raised. When Queen Eleanor 
took it over to Germany, it was at first evaded and refused. 
But she appealed to the honour of all the princes of the 
German Empire in behalf of her son, and appealed so well 
that it was accepted, and the King released. Thereupon, 
the King of France wrote to Prince John — “ Take care of 
thyself. The devil is unchained ! ” 

Prince John had reason to fear his brother, for he had 
been a traitor to him in his captivity. He had secretly 
joined the French King; had vowed to the English nobles 
and people that his brother was dead; and had vainly tried 
to seize the crown. He was now in France, at a place 
called iSvreux. Being the meanest and basest of men, he 
contrived a mean and base expedient for making himself 
acceptable to his brother. He invited the French officers 
of the garrison in that town to dinner, murdered them all, 
and then took the fortress. With this recommendation to 
the good will of a lion-hearted monarch, he hastened to 
King Richard, fell on his knees before him, and obtained 
the intercession of Queen Eleanor. “ I forgive him,” said 
the King, “ and I hope I may forget the injury he has done 
me, as easily as I know he will forget my pardon.” 

While King Richard was in Sicily, there had been trouble 
in his dominions at home : one of the bishops whom he had 
left in charge thereof, arresting the other; and making, in 
his pride and ambition, as great a show as if he were King 
himself. But the King hearing of it at Messina, and ap- 
pointing a new Regency, this Longchamp (for that was his 
name) had fled to France in a woman’s dress, and had there 
been encouraged and supported by the French King. With 
all these causes of offence against Philip in his mind, King 
Richard had no sooner been welcomed home by his enthu- 
siastic subjects with great display and splendour, and had 
no sooner been crowned afresh at Winchester, than he re- 
solved to show the French King that the devil was un- 
chained indeed, and made war against him with great fury. 

There was fresh trouble at home about this time, arising 
out of the discontents of the poor people, who complained 
that they were far more heavily taxed than the rich, and 
who found a spirited champion in William Fitz-Osbebt, 
called Longbeard. He became the leader of a secret so- 
ciety, comprising fifty thousand men; he was seized by 
surprise; he stabbed the citizen who first laid hands upon

him; and retreated, bravely fighting, to a church, which he 
maintained four days, until he was dislodged by fire, and 
run through the body as he came out. He was not killed, 
though; for he was dragged, half dead, at the tail of a 
horse to Smithfield, and there hanged. Death was long a 
favourite remedy for silencing the people’s advocates; but 
as we go on with this history, I fancy we shall find them 
i difficult to make an end of, for all that. 

The French war, delayed occasionally by a truce, was 
still in progress when a certain Lord named Vidomar, 
Viscount of Limoges, chanced to find in his ground a treas- 
! ure of ancient coins. As the King’s vassal, he sent the 
| King half of it; but the King claimed the whole. The 
lord refused to yield the whole. The King besieged the 
lord in his castle, swore that he would take the castle by 
storm, and hang every man of its defenders on the battle- 
ments 

There was a strange old song in that part of the country, 
to the effect that in Limoges an arrow would be made by 
which King Richard would die. It may be that Bertrand 
de Gourdon, a young man who was one of the defenders 
of the castle, had often sung it or heard it sung of a winter 
night, and remembered it when he saw, from his post upon 
the ramparts, the King attended only by his chief officer 
riding below the walls surveying the place. He drew an 
arrow to the head, took steady aim, said between his teeth, 
“ Now I pray God speed thee well, arrow ! ” discharged it, 
and struck the King in the left shoulder. 

Although the wound was not at first considered danger- 
ous, it was severe enough to cause the King to retire to his 
tent, and direct the assault to be made without him. The 
castle was taken; and every man of its defenders was 
hanged, as the King had sworn all should be, except Ber- 
i trand de Gourdon, who was reserved until the royal pleas- 
ure respecting him should be known. 

By that time unskilful treatment had made the wound 
mortal, and the King knew that he was dying. He directed 
Bertrand to be brought into his tent. The young man was 
brought there, heavily chained. King Richard looked at 
him steadily. He looked, as steadily, at the King. 

“ Knave ! ” said King Richard. “What have I done to 
thee that thou shouldest take my life? ” 

" What hast thou done to me? ” replied the young man.

a With thine own hands thou hast killed my father and my 
two brothers. Myself thou wouldest have hanged, ljet 
me die now, by any torture that thou wilt. My comfort is, 
that no torture can save Thee. Thou too must die; and, 
through me, the world is quit of thee ! ” 

Again the King looked at the young man steadily. 
Again the young man looked steadily at him. Perhaps 
some remembrance of his generous enemy Saladin, who was 
not a Christian, came into the mind of the dying King. 

“ Youth ! ” he said, u I forgive thee. Go unhurt l ” 

Then, turning to the chief officer who had been riding in" 
his company when he received the wound, King Richard 
said : 

** Take off his chains, give him a hundred shillings, and 
let him depart.” 

He sunk down on his couch, and a dark mist seemed in 
his weakened eyes to fill the tent wherein he had so often 
rested, and he died. His age was forty-two; he had 
reigned ten years. His last command was not obeyed; for 
the chief officer flayed Bertrand de Gourdon alive, and 
hanged him. 

There is an old tune yet known — a sorrowful air will 
sometimes outlive many generations of strong men, and 
evpn last longer than battle-axes with twenty pounds of 
steel iu the head — by which this King is said to have been 
discovered in his captivity. Blondel, a favourite Min- 
strel of King Richard, as the story relates, faithfully seek- 
ing his Royal master, went singing it outside the gloomy 
walls of many foreign fortresses and prisons; until at last 
he heard 1 it echoed from within a dungeon, and knew the 
voice, and cried out in ecstasy, “ 0 Richard, O my King ! ” 
You may believe it, if you like; it would be easy to believe 
worse things. Richard was himself a Minstrel and a Poet. 
If he had not been a Prince too, he might have been a bet- 
ter man perhaps, and might have gone out of the world 
with less bloodshed and waste of life to answer for.

CHAPTER XIV. 

ENGLAND UNDER KING JOHN, CALLED LACKLAND. 

At two-and-thirty years of age, John became King of 
England His pretty little nephew Arthur had the best 
claim to the throne; but John seized the treasure, and 
made fine promises to the nobility, and got himself crowned 
at Westminster within a few weeks after his brother Rich- 
ard's death. I doubt whether the crown could possibly 
have been put upon the head of a meaner coward, or a more 
detestable villain, if England had been Searched from end 
to end to find him out 

The French King, Philip, refused to acknowledge the 
right of John to his new dignity, and declared in favour ef 
Arthur. You must not suppose that he had any generosity 
o! feeling for the'fatherless boy; it merely suited his ambi- 
tious schemes to oppose the King of England. So John 
and the French King went to war about Arthur. 

He was a handsome boy, at that time only twelve years 
old. He was not bom when his father, Geoffrey, had his 
brains trampled out at the tournament; and, besides the' 
misfortune of never having known a father's guidance and 
protection, he had the additional misfortune to have a fool* 
rnh mother (Constance by name), lately married to her 
third husband. She took Arthur, upon John's accession, 
to the French King, who pretended to be very much his 
friend, and who made him a Knight, and promised him his 
daughter in marriage; but, who cared so little about him in 
reality, that finding it his interest to make peace with King 
John for a time, he did so without the least consideration 
for the poor little Prince, and heartlessly sacrificed all his 
interests. 

Young Arthur, for two years afterwards, lived quietly? 
and in the course of that time his mother died. But, the 
French King then finding it his interest to quarrel with 
King John again, again made Arthur his pretence, and in* 
vited the orphan boy to court. " You know your rights, 
Prince,” said the French King, “ and you would like to be

a King. Is it not so? ” u Truly,” said Prince Arthur, “I 
should greatly like to be a King! ” “ Then,” said Philip, 
“ you shall have two hundred gentlemen who are Knights 
of mine, and with them you shall go to win back the prov- 
inces belonging to you, of which your unde, the usurping 
King of England, has taken possession. I myself, mean- 
while, will head a force against him in Normandy.” Poor 
Arthur was so flattered and so grateful that he signed a 
treaty with the crafty French King, agreeing to consider 
him his superior Lord, and that the French King should 
keep for himself whatever he could take from King J ohn. 

Now, King J ohn was so bad in all ways, and King Philip 
was so perfidious, that Arthur, between the two, might as 
well have been a lamb between a fox and a wolf. But, 
being so young, he was ardent and flushed with hope; and, 
when the people of Brittany (which was his inheritance) 
sent him five hundred more knights and five thousand foot 
soldiers, he believed his fortune was made. The people of 
Brittany had been fond of him from his birth, and had re- 
quested that he might be called Arthur, in remembrance of 
that dimly-famous English Arthur, of Whom I told you 
early in this book, whom they believed to have been the 
brave friend and companion of an old King of their own. 
They had tales among them about a prophet called Mbk- 
lin (of the same old time), who had foretold that their 
own King should be restored to them after hundreds of 
years; and they believed that the prophecy would be ful- 
filled in Arthur; that the time would come when he would 
rule them with a crown of Brittany upon his head; and 
when neither King of France nor King of England would 
have any power over them. When Arthur found himself 
riding in a glittering suit of armour on a richly caparisoned 
horse, at the head of his train of knights and soldiers, he 
began to believe this too, and to consider old Merlin a very 
superior prophet. 

He did not know — how could he, being so innocent and 
inexperienced? — that his little army was a mere nothing 
against the power of the King of England. The French 
King knew it; but the poor boy’s fate was little to him, so 
that the King of England was worried and distressed. 
Therefore, King Philip went his way into Normandy, and 
Prince Arthur went his way towards Mirebeau, a French 
town near Poictiers, both very well pleased.

A CHILD’S HISTORY OP ENGLAND. 101 

Prince Arthur went to attack the town of Mirebeau, be- 
cause his grandmother Eleanor, who has so often made her 
appearance in this history (and who had always been his 
mother’s enemy), was living there, and because his Knights 
said, “ Prince, if you can take her prisoner, you will be 
able to bring the King your uncle to terms ! ” But she was 
not to be easily taken. She was old enough by this time 
—eighty — but she was as full of stratagem as she was full 
of years and .wickedness. Receiving intelligence of young 
Arthur’s approach, she shut herself up in a high tower, 
and encouraged her soldiers to defend it like men. Prince 
Arthur with his little army besieged the high tower. King 
John, hearing how matters stood, came up to the rescue, 
with his army. So here was a strange family-party ! The 
boy-Prince besieging his grandmother, and his uncle be- 
sieging him! 

This position of affairs did not last long. One summer 
night King John, by treachery, got his men into the town, 
surprised Prince Arthur’s force, took two hundred of his 
knights, and seized the Prince himself in his bed. The 
Knights were put in heavy irons, and driven away in open 
carts drawn by bullocks, to various dungeons where they 
were most inhumanly treated, and where some of them were 
starved to death. Prince Arthur was sent to the castle of 
Falaise. 

One day, while he was in prison at that castle, mourn- 
fully thinking it strange that one so young should be in so 
much trouble, and looking out of the small window in the 
deep dark wall, at the summer sky and the birds, the door 
was softly opened, and he saw his uncle the King standing 
in the shadow of the archway, looking very grim. 

“Arthur,” said the King, with his wicked eyes more on 
the stone floor than on his nephew, “ will you not trust to 
the gentleness, the friendship, and the truthfulness of your 
loving uncle? ” 

“ I will tell my loving uncle that,” replied the boy, “ when 
he does me right. Let him restore to me my kingdom of 
England, and then come to me and ask the question.” 

The King looked at him and went out. “ Keep that boy 
dose prisoner,” said he to the warden of the castle. 

Then, the King took secret counsel with the worst of his 
nobles how the Prince was to be got rid of. Some said, 
“Put out his eyes and keep him in prison, as Robert of

Normandy was kept.” Others skid, u Have him stabbed/ 
Others, “Have him hanged.” Others, “Have him poi- 
soned.” 

King John, feeling that in any ease, whatever was done 
afterwards, it would be a satisfaction to his mind to have 
those handsome eyes burnt out that had looked at him so 
proudly while his oWn royal eyes were blinking at the stone 
floor, sent certain ruffians to Falaise to blind the boy with 
red-hot irons. But Arthur so pathetically entreated them, 
and shed sueh piteous tears, .and so appealed to Hubert be 
BoUrO (or Button), the Warden of the castle, who had a 
lOVe for him, and Was an honourable tender man, that Hu- 
bert could not bear it. To his eternal honour he prevented 
the torture from being performed, and, at his own risk, sent 
the savages away* 

The chafed and disappointed King bethought hifnself of 
the stabbing suggestion hext, and, with his shuffling man- 
ner and his cruel face, proposed it to one William de> Bray* 
“ I am a gentleman and not an executioner,” said William 
de Bray, and left the presence with disdain. 

But it was not difficult for a King to hire a murderer in 
those days. King John found one for his money, and sent 
him down to the castle of Falaise. “ On what errand dost 
thou coine?” said Hubert to this fellow. “To despatch 
young Arthur,” he returned. “ Go back to him who sent 
thee,” answered Hubert, “and say that I will do it! ” 

King John very well knowing that Hubert would never 
do it, but that he courageously sent this reply to save the 
Prince or gain time, despatched messengers to convey the 
young prisoner to the castle of Rouen* 

Arthur was soon forced from the good Hubert — of whom 
he had never stood in greater need than then— carried away 
by night, and lodged in his new prison : where, through his 
grated window, he fcould hear the deep Waters of the river 
Seine, rippling against the stone wall below. 

One dark night, as he My sleeping, dreaming perhaps of 
rescue by those unfortunate gentlemen who were obscurely* 
suffering and dying in his cause, he was roused, and bidden 
by his jailer to come down the staircase to the foot of the 
tower. He hurriedly dressed himself and obeyed. When 
they came to the bottom of the winding stairs, and the 
night air from the river blew upon their faces, the jailer 
trod upon his torch and put it out* Then, Arthur, in the

darkness, was hurriedly drawn into a solitary hpaf. Aud 
in that boat, he found his uncle and one other man. 

He knelt to them* and prayed them not to murder hhftt 
Deaf to his entreaties, they stabbed him and sunk hi§ body 
in the river with heavy stones. When the springrmwung 
broke, the towerrdoor was closed, the boat was gone, the 
river sparkled on its way, and never more wap any trace of 
the poor boy beheld by mortal eyes. 

The news of this atrocfous murder being spread in Eng- 
land, awakened a hatred of the King (already odious for 
his many vices, and for his having stolen away and married 
a noble lady while his own wife was living) that never 
slept again through his whole reign. In Brittany, the in- 
dignation was intense. Arthur's own sister En$AjsrpB was 
in the power of John and shut up in a convent at Bristol, 
but his half-sister Alice was in Brittany. The people 
chose her, and the murdered prince's father-ip- Jaw> the 
last husband of Oonstanoe, to represent them* and carried 
their fiery complaints to King Philip. King Phijip sum- 
moned King John (as the holder of territory in Bruu 06 ) to 
come before him and defend himself. King John Refusing 
to appear. King Philip declared him false, perjured, pud 
guilty; and again made war. In a little time, by pouquerr 
ing Hie greater part of his French territory, King Philip 
deprived him of one-third of his dominions. . And* through 
all the fighting that took place, King jqhq was always 
found, either te be eating and drinking, like a gluttonous 
fool, when the danger was at a distance, qv to be running 
away, like a beaten cur, when it was near. 

You might suppose that when he was losing Jus domipr 
ions at this rate, and when his own nobles cared SO little 
for him or his cause that they plainly refused to f oljpw his 
banner ont of England, he had enemies enough. But he 
made another enemy of Hie Pope, which he did iq this way f

declared that neither election would do for him, and that 
he elected Stephen" Langton* The monks submitting to 
the Pope, the King turned them all out bodily, and banished 
them as traitors. The Pope sent three bishops to the King, 
to threaten him with an Interdict. The King told the 
bishops that if any Interdict were laid upon his kingdom, 
he would tear out the eyes and cut off the noses of all the 
monks he could lay hold of, and send them over to Rome 
in that undecorated state as a present for their master. 
The bishops, nevertheless, soon published the Interdict, 
and fled. 

After it had lasted a year, the Pope proceeded to his next 
step; which was Excommunication. King John was de- 
clared excommunicated, with all the usual ceremonies. The 
King was so incensed at this, and was made so desperate 
by the disaffection of his Barons and the hatred of his peo- 
ple, that it is said he even privately sent ambassadors to 
the Turks in Spain, offering to renounce his religion and 
hold his kingdom of them if they would help him. It is 
related that the ambassadors were admitted to the presence 
of the Turkish Emir through long lines of Moorish guards, 
and that they found the Emir with his eyes seriously fixed 
on the pages of a large book, from which he never once 
looked up. That they gave him a letter from the King 
containing his proposals, and were gravely dismissed. 
That presently the Emir sent for one of them, and conjured 
him, by his faith in his religion, to say what kind of man 
the King of England truly was? That the ambassador, 
thus pressed, replied that the King of England was a false 
tyrant, against whom his own subjects would soon rise. 
And that this was quite enough for the Emir. 

Money being, in his position, the next best thing to 
men, King John spared no means of getting it. He set on 
foot another oppressing and torturing of the unhappy Jews 
(which was quite in his way), and invented a new punish- 
ment for one wealthy Jew of Bristol. Until such time as 
that Jew should produce a certain large sum of money, the 
King sentenced him to be imprisoned, and, every day, to 
have one tooth violently wrenched out of his head — begin- 
ning with the double teeth. For seven days, the oppressed 
man bore ’the daily pain and lost the daily tooth; but, on 
the eighth, he paid the money. With the treasure raised 
in such ways, the King made an expedition into Ireland,

where some English nobles had revolted. It was one of 
the very few places from which he did not run away ; be- 
cause no resistance was shown. He made another expedi- 
tion into Wales — whence he did run away in the end: but 
not before he had got from the Welsh people, as hostages, 
twenty-seven, young men of the best families; every one of 
whom he caused to be slain in the following year. 

To Interdict and Excommunication, the Pope now added 
his last sentence; Deposition. He proclaimed John no 
longer King, absolved all his subjects from their allegiance, 
and sent Stephen Langtotn and others to the King of Prance 
to tell him that, if he would invade England, he should be 
forgiven all his sins — at least; should be forgiven them by 
the Pope, if that would do. 

As there was nothing that King Philip desired more than 
to invade England, he collected a great army at Rouen, and 
a fleet of seventeen hundred ships to bring them over. 
But the English people, however bitterly they hated the 
Ring, were not a people to suffer invasion quietly. They 
flocked to Dover, where the English standard- was, in such 
great numbers to enrol themselves as defenders of their 
native land, that there were not provisions for them, and 
the King could only select and retain sixty thousand. But, 
at this crisis, the Pope, who had his own reasons for ob- 
jecting to either King John or King Philip being too pow- 
erful, interfered He entrusted a legate, whose name was 
PandoIjF, with the easy task of frightening King John. 
He sent him to the English Camp, from France, to terrify 
him with exaggerations of King Philip’s power, and his 
own weakness in the discontent of the English Barons and 
people. Pandolf discharged his commission so well, that 
King John, in a wretched panic, consented to acknowledge 
Stephen Langton; to resign his kingdom “to God, Saint 
Peter, and Saint Paul ” — which meant the Pope; and to 
hold it, ever afterwards, by the Pope’s leave, on payment 
of an annual sum of money. To this shameful contract he 
publicly bound himself in the church of the Knights Tem- 
plars at Dover: where he laid at the legate’s feet a part of 
the tribute, which the legate haughtily trampled upon. 
But they do say, that this was merely a genteel flourish, 
and that he was afterwards seen to pick it up and pocket 
it 

There was an unfortunate prophet, of the name of Peter,

JLUb 

who had greatly increased King John’s terrors by predict* 
ing that he would be unknighted (which the King sup- 
posed to signify that he would die) before the Feast of the 
Ascension should be past. That was the day after this 
humiliation. When the next morning came, and the King, 
who had been trembling all night, found himself alive and 
safe, he ordered the prophet — and his son too — to be 
dragged through the streets at the tails of horses, and then 
hanged, for having frightened him. 

As King John had now submitted, the Pope, to King 
Philip’s great astonishment, took him under his protection, 
and informed King Philip that he found he could not give 
him leave to invade England. The angry Philip resolved 
to do it without his leave; but he gained nothing and lost 
much; for, the English, commanded by the Earl of Salis- 
bury, went over, in five hundred ships, to the French coast, 
before the French fleet had sailed away from it, and utterly 
defeated the whole 

The Pope then took off his three sentences, one after 
another*, and empowered Stephen Langton publicly to re- 
ceive King John into the favour of the Church again, and 
to ask him to dinner. The King, who hated Langton with 
all his might and main — and with reason too, for he was a 
great and a good man, with whom such a King could have 
no sympathy — pretended to cry and to be very grateful. 
There was a little difficulty about settling how much the 
King should pay as a recompense to the clergy for the 
losses he had caused them ; but, the end of it was, that the 
superior clergy got a good deal, and the inferior clergy got 
little or nothing — which has also happened since King 
John’s time, I believe. 

When all these matters were arranged, the King in his 
triumph became more fierce, and false, and insolent to all 
around him than he had ever been. An alliance of sover- 
eigns against King Philip, gave him an opportunity of 
landing an army in France; with which he even took a 
town! But, on the French King’s gaining a great victory, 
he ran away, of course, and made a truce for five years* 

And now the time approached when he was to be still 
further humbled, and made to feel, if he could feel any^ 
thing, what a wretched creature he was. Of all men in the 
world, Stephen Langton seemed raised up by Heaven 
oppose and subdue him. When he ruthlessly burnt sou

destroyed the property of his own subjects, because their 
Lords, the Barons, would not serve him abroad, Stephen 
Langton fearlessly reproved and threatened him. When 
he swore to restore the laws of King Edward, or the laws 
of King Henry the First, Stephen Langton knew his false* 
hood, and pursued him through all his evasions. When 
the Barons met at the abbey of Saint Edmund’ s-Bury* to 
consider their wrongs and the King’s oppressions, Stephen 
Langton roused them by his fervid words to demand a sol* 
earn charter of rights and liberties from their perjured 
master, and to swear, one by one, on the High Altar, that 
they would have it, or would wage war against him to the 
death. When the King hid himself in London from the 
Barons, and was at last obliged to receive them, they told 
him roundly they would not believe him unless Stephen 
Langton became a surety that he would keep his word. 
When # he took the Cross to invest himself with some inter- 
est, and belong to something that was received with favour, 
Stephen Langton was still immovable. When he appealed 
to the Pope, and the Pope wrote to Stephen Langton in be- 
half of his new favourite, Stephen Langton was deaf, even 
to the Pope himself, and saw before him nothing but the 
welfare of England and the crimes of the English King. 

At Easter-time, the Barons assembled at Stamford, in 
Lincolnshire, in proud array, and, marching near to Oxford 
where the King was, delivered into the hands of Stephen 
Lan gton and two others, a list of grievances. “ And these, ” 
they said, “ he must redress, or we will do it for ourselves ! ” 
When Stephen Langton told the King as much, and read 
the list to him, he went half mad with rage. But that did 
him no more good than his afterwards trying to pacify the 
Barons with lies. They called themselves and their fol- 
lowers, “ The army of God and the Holy Church. ” March- 
ing through the country, with the people thronging to 
them everywhere (except at Northampton, where they 
failed in an attack upon the castle), they at last trium- 
phantly set up their banner in London itself, whither the 
whole land, tired of the tyrant, seemed to flock to join 
them. Seven knights alone, of all the knights in England, 
remained with the King; who, reduced to this strait, at 
last sent the Earl of Pembroke to the Barons to say that 
be approved of everything, and would meet them to sign 
their charter when they would. “ Then,” said the Barons, 1

“ let the day be the fifteenth of June, and the place, Run* 
ny-Mead. w 

On Monday, the fifteenth of June, one thousand two 
hundred and fourteen, the King came from Windsor Castle, 
and the Barons came from the town of Staines, and they 
met on Runny*Mead, which is still a pleasant meadow by 
the Thames, where rushes grow in the clear water of the 
winding river, and its banks are green with grass and trees. 
On the side of the Barons, came the General of their army, 
Robert Fitz- Walter, and a great concourse of the nobil- 
ity of England. With the King, came, in all, some four- 
and-twenty persons of any note, most of whom despised 
him, and were merely his advisers in form. On that great 
day, and in that great company, the King signed Magna 
Charta — the great charter of England — by which he 
pledged himself to maintain the Church in its rights; to 
relieve the Barons of oppressive obligations as vassals of 
the Crown — of which the Barons, in their turn, pledged 
themselves to relieve their vassals, the people; to respect 
the liberties of London and all other cities and boroughs; 
to protect foreign merchants who came to England; to 
imprison no man without a fair trial; and to sell, delay, or 
deny justice to none. As the Barons knew his falsehood 
well, they further required, as their securities, that he 
should send out of his kingdom all his foreign troops; that 
for two months they should hold possession of the city of 
London, and Stephen Langton of the Tower; and that five- 
and-twenty of their body, chosen by themselves, should be 
a lawful committee to watch the keeping of the charter, and 
to make war upon him if he broke it 

All this he was obliged to yield. He signed the charter 
with a smile, and, if he could have looked agreeable, would 
have done so, as he departed from the splendid assembly J 
When he got home to Windsor Castle, he was quite a macL 
man in his helpless fury. And he broke the charter imme^ 
diately afterwards. 

He sent abroad for foreign soldiers, and sent to the Pope 
for help, and plotted to take London by surprise, while the 
Barons should be holding a great tournament at Stamford, 
which they had agreed to hold there as a celebration of the 
charter. The Barons, however, found him out and put U 
off. Then, when the Barons desired to see him and t&i 
him with Ids treachery, he made numbers of appointments

with them, and kept non^, and shifted from place to place, 
and was constantly sneaking and skulking about. At last 
he appeared at Dover, to join his foreign soldiers, of whom 
numbers came into his pay; and with them he besieged and 
took Rochester Castle, which was occupied by knights and 
soldiers of the Barons. He would have hanged them 
everyone; but the leader of the foreign soldiers, fearful of 
what the English people might afterwards do to him, inter- 
fered to save the knights; therefore the King was fain to 
satisfy his vengeance with the death of all the common 
men. Then, he sent the Earl of Salisbury, with one por- 
tion of his army, to ravage the eastern part of his own do- 
minions, while he carried fire and slaughter into the north- 
ern part; torturing, plundering, killing, and inflicting every 
possible cruelty upon the people; and, every morning, set- 
ting a worthy example to his men by setting fire, with his 
own monster-hands, to the house where he had slept last 
night. Nor was this all; for the Pope, coming to the aid 
of his precious friend, laid the kingdom under an Interdict 
again, because the people took part with the Barons. It 
did not much matter, for the people had grown so used to 
it now, that they had begun to think nothing about it. It 
occurred to them— perhaps to Stephen Langton too — that 
they could keep their churches open, and ring their bells, 
without the Pope’s permission as well as with it. So, they 
tried the experiment — and found that it succeeded perfectly. 

It being now impossible to bear the country, as a wilder- 
ness of cruelty, or longer to hold any term with such a 
forsworn outlaw of a King, the Barons sent to Louis, son 
of the French monarch, to offer him the English crown. 
Caring as little for the Pope’s excommunication of him if 
he accepted the offer, as it is possible his father may have 
cared for the Pope’s forgiveness of his sins, he landed at 
8andwich (King John immediately running away from 
Dover, where he happened to be), and went on to London. 
The Scottish King, with whom many of the Northern Eng- 
lish Lords had taken refuge; numbers of the foreign sol- 
diers, numbers of the Barons, and numbers of the people 
went over to him every day; — King John, the while, con- 
tinually running away in all directions. The career of 
Txmis was checked, however, by the suspicions of the Bar* 
ons, founded on the dying declaration of a French Lord, 
that when the kingdom was conquered he was sworn to

banifch them as traitors* and to gfrve their estates td some 
of his own Nobles. Rather than suffer this, some of the 
Barons hesitated : others even went over td Kiiig John. 

It seemed to be the turning-point of King John’s fort- 
unes* for* iii his Savage and murderous course, he had now 
taken Some towns and met with some successes. But* hap- 
pily for England and humanity, his death Was ndar. Cross- 
ing a dangerous quicksand, called the Wash, not very far 
from Wisbeach, the tide dame tip and nearly drowned his 
army. He and his soldiers escaped; but, looking bfcck 
from the shore when he was safe, he saw the roaririg water 
sweep down in a torrent* overturn the waggons, horSUs, and 
men, that carried his treasure, and engulf them in a raging 
whirlpool from which nothing coUld be delivered. 

Cursing, and swearing, and gnawing his fingers* he went 
on td Swinestead Abbey, where the monks set before him 
quantities of pears* and peaches, hnd new eider— some say 
poisoii too, but there is very little reason to suppose so — of 
which he ate arid drank in an immoderate arid beastly way 
All night hfe lay ill of a burning fever* arid haunted with 
horrible fears. Next day, they put him in a horse-litter, 
arid carried him td Sleaford Gastle, where he passed another 
night of pain and horror. Next day, they carried him, 
with greater difficulty than on the day before, to the castle 
of Newkrk upon Trerit; and there, on the eighteenth of 
October* in the forty -ninth year of his age, and the seven- 
teenth of his vile reign, was an end of this miserable brrte.

only ten years old. As the Crown itself had been lost with 
the King’s treasure, in the raging water, and, as there was 
no time to make another, they, put a circle of plain gold 
upon his head instead. “ We have been the enemies of this 
child’s father,” said Lord Pembroke, a good and true gen- 
tleman, to the few Lords who were present, “ and he mer- 
ited our ill-will; but the child himself is innocent, and his 
youth demands our friendship and protection.” Those 
Lords felt tenderly towards the little boy, remembering 
their own young children; and they bowed their heads, 
and said, “ Long live King Henry the Third ! ” 

Next, a great council met at Bristol, revised Magna 
Charta, and made Lord Pembroke Regent or Protector of 
England, as the King was too young to reign alone. The 
next thing to be done, waS to get rid of Prince Louis of 
France, and to win over those English Barons who were 
still ranged under his banner. He was strong in many 
parts of England, and in London itself; and he held, among 
other places, a certain Ckstle called the Castle of Mount 
Sorel, in Leicestershire. To this fortress, after some skir- 
mishing and truce-making. Lord Pembroke laid siege. 
Louis despatched an army of six hundred knights and 
twenty thousand soldiers to relieve it. Lord Pembroke, 
who was not strong enough for such a force, retired with 
all his men. The army of the French Prince, which had 
marched there with fire and plunder, marched away with 
fire and plunder, and came, in a boastful swaggering man- 
ner, to Lincoln. The town submitted; but the Castle in the 
the town, held by a brave widow lady, named Nichola de 
Camvtlle (whose property it was), made such a sturdy 
resistance, that the French Count in command of the army 
of the French Prince found it necessary to besiege this Cas- 
tle. While he was thus engaged, word was brought to him 
that Lord Pembroke, with four hundred knights, two 
hundred and fifty inen with cross-bows, and a stout force 
both of horse and foot, was marching towards him. 
“What care I?” said the French Count. “The English- 
man is not so mad as to attack me and my great army in a 
walled town ! ” But the Englishman did it for all that, 
and did it — not so madly but so wisely, that he decoyed 
the great army into the narrow, ill-paved lanes and bye- 
ways of Lincoln, where its horse-soldiers could not ride in 
any strong body; ahd there he made such havoc with them,

that the whole force surrendered themselves prisoners, ex- 
cept the Count; who said that he would never yield to any 
English traitor alive, and accordingly got killed. The end 
of this victory, which the English called, for a joke, the 
Fair of Lincoln, was the usual one in those times — the 
common men were slain without any mercy, and the knights 
and gentlemen paid ransom and went home. 

The wife of Louis, the fair Blanche of Castile, duti- 
fully equipped a fleet of eighty good ships, and sent it over 
from France to her husband* s aid. An English fleet of forty 
ships, some good and some bad, gallantly met them near 
the mouth of the Thames, and took or sunk sixty-five in 
one tight. This great loss put an end to the French 
Prince’s hopes. A treaty was made at Lambeth, in virtue 
of which the English Barons who had remained attached to 
his cause returned to their allegiance, and it was engaged 
on both sides that the Prince and all his troops should 
retire peacefully to France. It was time to go; for 
war had made him so poor that he was obliged to borrow 
money from the citizens of London to pay his expenses 
home. 

Lord Pembroke afterwards applied himself to governing 
the country justly, and to healing the quarrels and disturb- 
ances that had arisen among men in the days of the bad 
King John. He caused Magna Chartato be still more im- 
proved, and so amended the Forest Laws that a Peasant 
was no longer put to death for killing a stag in a Royal 
Forest, but was only imprisoned. It would have been well 
for England if it could have had so good a Protector many 
years longer, but that was not to be. Within three years 
after the young King’s Coronation, Lord Pembroke died; 
and you may see his tomb, at this day, in the old Temple 
Church in London. 

The Protectorship was now divided. Peter de Roches, 
whom King John had made Bishop of Winchester, was en- 
trusted with the care of the person of the young sovereign; 
and the exercise of the Royal authority was confided to 
Earl Hubert de Burgh. These two personages had from 
the first no liking for each other, and soon became enemies. 
When the young King was declared of age, Peter de 
Roches, finding that Hubert increased in power and favour, 
retired discontentedly, and went abroad. For nearly ten 
years afterwards Hubert had full sway alone.

But ten years is a long time to hold the favour of a 
King. This King, too, as he grew up, showed a strong 
resemblance to his father, in feebleness, inconsistency, and 
irresolution. The best that can be said of him is that he 
was not cruel. De Roches coming home again, after ten 
years, and being a novelty, the King began to favour him 
and to look coldly on Hubert. Wanting money besides, 
and having made Hubert rich, he began to dislike Hubert. 
At last he was made to believe, or pretended to believe, 
that Hubert had misappropriated some of the Royal treas- 
ure ; and ordered him to furnish an account of all he had 
done in his administration. Besides which, the foolish 
charge was brought against Hubert that he had made him- 
self the King’s favourite by magic. Hubert very well 
knowing that he could never defend himself against such 
nonsense, and that his old enemy must be determined on 
his ruin, instead of answering the charges fled to Merton 
Abbey. Then the King, in a violent passion, sent for the 
Mayor of London, and said to the Mayor, “ Take twenty 
thousand citizens, and drag me Hubert de Burgh out of that 
abbey, and bring him here.” The Mayor posted off to do 
it, but the Archbishop of Dublin (who was a friend of 
Hubert’s) warning the King that an abbey was a sacred 
place, and that if he committed any violence there, he must 
answer for it to the Church, the King changed his mind 
and called the Mayor back, and declared that Hubert 
should have four months to prepare his defence, and should 
be safe and free during that time. 

Hubert, who relied upon the King’s word, though I 
think he was old enough to have known better, came out of 
Merton Abbey upon these conditions, and journeyed away 
to see his wife : a Scottish Princess who was then at Saint 
Edmund’ s-Bury. 

Almost as soon as he had departed from the Sanctuary, 
his enemies persuaded the weak King to send out one Sir 
Godfrey de Crancumb, who commanded three hundred 
vagabonds called the Black Band, with orders to seize him. 
They came up with him at a little town in Essex, called 
Brentwood, when he was in bed. He leaped out of bed, 
got out of the house, fled to the church, ran up to the altar, 
and laid his hand upon the cross. Sir Godfrey and the 
Black Band, caring neither for church, altar, nor cross, 
dragged him forth to the church door, with their drawn

swords flashing round his head, and sent for a Smith to 
rivet a set of chains upon him. When the Smith (I wish 
I knew his name !) was brought, all dark and swarthy with 
the smoke of his forge, and panting with the speed he had 
made; and the Black Band, falling aside to show him the 
Prisoner, cried with a loud uproar, “Make the fetters 
heavy! make them strong!” the Smith dropped upon his 
knee — but not to the Black Band — and said, “This is the 
brave Earl Hubert de Burgh, who fought at Dover Castle, 
and destroyed the French fleet, and has done his country 
much good service. You may kill me, if you like, but I 
will never make a chain for Earl Hubert de Burgh ! ” 

The Black Band never blushed, or they might have 
blushed at this. They knocked the Smith about from one 
to another, and swore at him, and tied the Earl on horse- 
back, undressed as he was, and carried him off to the 
Tower of London. The Bishops, however, were so indig- 
nant at the violation of the Sanctuary of the Church, that 
the frightened King soon ordered the Black Band to take 
him back again; at the same time commanding the Sheriff 
of Essex to prevent his escapiitg out of Brentwood Church. 
Well ! the Sheriff dvfg a deep trench all round the church, 
and erected a high fence, and watched the church night 
and day; the Black Band and their Captain watched it too, 
like three hundred and one black wolves. For thirty-nine 
days, Hubert de Burgh remained within. At length, upon 
the fortieth day, cold and hunger were too much for him, 
and he gave himself up to the Black Band, who carried 
him off, for the second time, to the Tower. When his trial 
came on, he refused to plead; but at last it was arranged 
that he should give up all the royal lands which had been 
bestowed upon him, and should be kept at the Castle of 
Devizes, in what was called “ free prison,” in charge of four 
knights appointed by four lords. There, he remained 
almost a year, until, learning that a follower of his old 
enemy the Bishop was made Keeper of the Castle, and fear- 
ing that he might be killed by treachery, he climbed the 
ramparts one dark night, dropped from the top of the high 
Castle wall into the moat, and coming safely to the^ grouud, 
took refuge in another church. From this place lie was 
delivered by a party of horse despatched to his help by 
some nobles, who were by this time in revolt against the 
King, and assembled m Wales- , He ( wa$ finally jwdo^i

and restored to his estates, but he lived privately, and never 
more aspired to a high post in the realm, or to a high place 
in the King’s favour. And thus end — more happily than 
the stories of matfcr favourites of Kings — the adventures 
of Earl Hubert de Burgh. 

The nobles, who had risen in revolt, were stirred up to 
rebellion by the overbearing conduct of the Bishop of Win- 
chester, who, finding that the King secretly hated the 
Great Charter which had been forced from his father, did 
his utmost to confirm him in that dislike, and in the pref- 
erence he showed to foreigners over the English. Of this, 
and of his even publicly declaring that the Barons of Eng- 
land were inferior to those of Fiance, the English Lords 
complained with such bitterness, that the King, finding 
them well supported by the clergy, became frightened for 
his throne, and sent away the Bishop and all his foreign 
associates. On his marriage, however, with Eleanor, a 
French lady, the daughter of the Count of Provence, he 
openly favoured the foreigners again; and so many of his 
wife’s relations came over, and made such an immense 
family-party at court, and got so many good things, and 
pocketed so much money, and were so high with the Eng- 
lish whose money they pocketed, that the bolder English 
Barons murmured openly about a clause there was in the 
Great Charter, which provided for the banishment of un- 
reasonable favourites. But, the foreigners only laughed 
disdainfully, and said, “What are your English laws to 
us?” 

King Philip of France had died, and had been succeeded 
by Prince Louis, who had also died after a short reign Of 
three years, and had been succeeded by his son of the same 
name — so moderate and just a man that he was not the 
least in the world like a King, as Kings went. Isabella, 
King Henry’s mother, wished very much (for a certain 
spite she had) that England should make war against this 
King; and, as King Henry Was a mere puppet in anybody’s 
hands who knew how to manage his feebleness, she easily 
carried her point with him. But, the Parliament were de- 
termined to give him no money for such a war. So, to 
defy the Parliament, he packed up thirty large casks of 
silver — I don^t know how lie got so much; I dare say he 
screwed it out of the miserable Jews — and put them aboard 
ship, and went away himself to carry war into France : ac-

companied by his mother and his brother Richard, Earl of 
Cornwall, who was rich and clever. But he only got weU 
beaten, and came home. 

The good humour of the Parliament tras not restored by 
this. They reproached the King with .wasting the public 
money to make greedy foreigners rich, and were so stern 
with him, and so determined not to let him have more of 
it to waste if they could help it, that he was at his wit’s 
end for some, and tried so shamelessly to get all he could 
from his subjects, by excuses or by force, that the people 
used to say the King was the sturdiest beggar in England. 
He took the Cross, thinking to get some money by that 
means; but, as it was very well known that he never meant 
to go on a crusade, he got none. In all this contention, 
the Londoners were particularly keen against the King, 
and the King hated them warmly in return. Hating or 
loving, however, made no difference; he continued in the 
same condition for nine or ten years, when at last the Bar- 
ons said that if he would solemnly confirm their liberties 
afresh, the Parliament would vote him a large sum. 

As he readily consented, there was a great meeting held 
in Westminster Hall, one pleasant day in May, when all 
the clergy, dressed in their robes and holding every one of 
them a burning candle in his hand, stood up (the Barons 
being also there) while the Archbishop of Canterbury read 
the sentence of excommunication against any man, and all 
men, who should henceforth, in any way, infringe the 
Great Charter of the Kingdom. When he had done, they 
all put out their burning candles with a curse upon the 
soul of any one, and every one, who should merit that sen- 
tence. The King concluded with an oath to keep the 
Charter, “ As I am a man, as I am a Christian, as I am a 
Knight, as I am a King! ” 

It was easy to make oaths, and easy t q break them; and 
the King did both, v as his father had done before him. He 
took to his old courses again when he was supplied with 
money, and soon cured of their weakness the few who had 
ever really trusted him. When his money was gone, and 
he was once more borrowing and begging everywhere with 
a meanness worthy of his nature, he got into a difficulty 
with the Pope respecting the Crown of Sicily, which the 
Pope said he had a right to give away, mid which he 
offered to King Henry for his second son. Prince Ed*

mund. But, if you or I give away what we have not got, 
and what belongs to somebody else, it is likely that the 
person to whom we give it, will have some trouble in tak- 
ing it. It was exactly so in this case. It was necessary 
to conquer the Sicilian Crown before it could be put upon 
young Edmund’s head. It could not be conquered without 
money. The Pope ordered the clergy to raise money. 
The clergy, however, were not so obedient to hiim as usual; 
they had been disputing with him for some time about his 
unjust preference of Italian Priests in England; and they 
had begun to doubt whether the King’s chaplain, whom he 
allowed to be paid for preaching in seven hundred churches, 
could possibly be, even by the Pope’s favour, in seven hun- 
dred places at once. “The Pope and the King together,” 
said the Bishop of London, “may take the mitre off my 
head; but, if they do, they will find that I shall put on a 
soldier’s helmet. I pay nothing. ” The Bishop of Worces- 
ter was as bold as the Bishop of London, and would pay 
nothing either. Such sums as the more timid or more 
helpless of the clergy did raise were squandered away, 
without doing any good to the King, or bringing the Sicil- 
ian Crown an inch nearer to Prince Edmund’s head. The 
end of the business was, that the Pope gave the Crown to 
the brother of the King of France (who conquered it for 
himself), and sent the King of England in a bill of one 
hundred thousand pounds for the expenses of not having 
won it. 

The King was now so much distressed that we might 
almost pity him, if it were possible to pity a King so 
shabby and ridiculous. His clever brother, Richard, had 
bought the title of King of the Romans from the German 
people, and was no longer near him, to help him with ad- 
vice. The clergy, resisting the very Pope, were in alliance 
with the Barons. The Barons were headed by Simon de 
Montfort, Earl of Leicester, married to King Henry’s sis- 
ter, and, though a foreigner himself, the most popular man 
in England against the foreign favourites. When the 
King next met his Parliament, the Barons, led by this 
Earl, came before him, armed from head to foot, and cased 
in armour. When the Parliament again assembled, in a 
month’s time, at Oxford, this Earl was at their head, and 
the King was obliged to consent, on oath, to what was 
called a Committee of Government : consisting of twenty-

four members : twelve chosen by the Barons, and twelve 
chosen by himself. 

But, at a good time for him, his brother Richard came 
back. Richard’s first act (the Barons would not admit 
him into England on other terms) was to swear to be faith- 
ful to the Committee of Government— which he immedi- 
ately began to oppose with all his might. Then, the Bar- 
ons began to quarrel among themselves; especially the 
proud Earl of Gloucester with the Earl of Leicester, who 
went abroad in disgust. Then, the people began to be dis- 
satisfied with the Barons, because they did not do enough 
for them. The King’s chances seemed so good again at 
length, that he took heart enough — or caught it from his 
brother — to tell the Committee of Government that he abol- 
ished them — as to his oath, never mind that, the Pope 
said ! — and to seize all the money in the Mint, and to shut 
himself up in the Tower of London. Here he wasioined 
by his eldest son, Prince Edward; and, , from the Tower, 
he made public a letter of the Pope’s to the world in gen- 
eral, informing all men that he had been an excellent and 
just King for five -and -forty years. 

As everybody knew he had been nothing of the sort, no- 
body cared much for this document. It so chanced that 
the proud Earl of Gloucester dying, was succeeded by his 
son; and that his son, instead of being the enemy of the 
Earl of Leicester, was (for the time) his friend. It fell 
out, therefore, that these two Earls joined their forces, took 
several of the Royal Castles in the country, and advanced 
as hard as they could on London. The Lohdon people, 
always opposed to the King, declared for them with great 
joy. The King himself remained shut up, not at all glori- 
ously, in the Tower. Prince Edward made the best of his 
way to Windsor Castle. His mother, the Queen, attempted 
to follow him by water; but, the people seeing her barge 
rowing up the river, and hating her wifh all their hearts, 
ran to London Bridge, got together a quantity of stones 
and mud, and pelted the barge as it came through, crying 
furiously, “Drown the Witch! Drown her!” They were 
so near doing it, that the Mayor took the old lady under 
his protection, and shut her up in Saint Paul’s until the 
danger was past. 

It would require a great deal of writing on my part, and 
a great deal of reading on youi^ to .follow the King

through his disputes with the Barons, and to follow the 
Barons through their disputes with one another — so I will 
make short work of it for both of us, and only relate the 
chief events that arose out of these quarrels. The good 
King of France was asked to decide between them. He 
gaye it as his opinion that the King must maintain the 
Great Charter, and that the Barons must give up the Com- 
mittee of Government, and all the rest that had been done 
by the Parliament at Oxford: which the Royalists, or 
King’s party, scornfully called the Mad Parliament. The 
Barons declared that these were not fair terms, and they 
would not accept them. Then they caused the great bell 
of Saint Paul’s to be tolled, for the purpose of rousing up 
the London people, who armed themselves at the dismal 
sound and formed quite an army in the streets. I am sorry 
to say, however, that instead of falling upon the King’s 
party with whom their quarrel was, they fell upon the 
miserable Jews, and killed at least five hundred of them. 
They pretended that some of these Jews were on the 
King’s side, and that they kept hidden in their houses, 
for the destruction of the people, a certain terrible compo- 
sition called Greek Fire, which could not be put put with 
water, but only burnt the, fiercer for it. What they really 
did keep in their houses was mopey; and this their cruel 
enemies wanted, and this their cruel enemies took, like 
robbers and murderers. 

The Earl of Leicester put himself at the Jxead of these 
Londoners and other forces, and followed the King to 
Lewes in Sussex, where he lay encamped with his army. 
Before giving the King’s forces battle here, the Earl ad- 
dressed his soldiers, and said that King Henry the Third 
had broken so many oaths, that he had become the enemy 
of God, and therefore they would wear white crosses on 
their breasts, as if they were arrayed, not against a fellow- 
Ohristian, but against a Turk. White-crossed accordingly, 
they rushed into the fight. They would have lost the day 
— the King having on his side all the foreigners in Eng- 
land : and, from Scotland, John Comyn, John Baliol, and 
Robert Bruce, with all their men — but for the impatience 
of Prince Edward, who, in his hot desire to have ven- 
geance on the people of London, threw the whole of his 
father’^ arpay into confusion. He was taken Prisoner; so 
was the Bang; so was the King’s brother the King of the

Romans; and five thousand Englishmen were left dead 
upon the bloody grass. 

For this success, the Pope excommunicated the Earl of 
Leicester : which neither the Earl nor the people cared at 
all* about. The people loved him and supported him, and 
he became the real King; having all the power of the gov- 
ernment in his own hands, though he was outwardly re- 
spectful to King Henry the Third, whom he took with him 
wherever he went, like a poor old limp court-card. He 
summoned a Parliament (in the year one thousand two 
hundred and sixty-five) which was the first Parliament in 
England that the people had any real share in electing; 
and he grew more and more in favour with the people every 
day, and they 1 stood by him in whatever he did. 

Many of the other Barons, and particularly the Earl of 
Gloucester, who had become by this time as proud as his 
father, grew jealous of this powerful and popular Earl, 
who was proud too, and began to conspire against him. 
Since the battle of Lewes, Prince Edward had been kept as 
a hostage, and, though he was otherwise treated like a 
Prince, had never been allowed to go out without attendants 
appointed by the Earl of Leicester, who watched him. The 
conspiring Lords found means to propose to him, in secret, 
that they should assist him to escape, and should make 
him their leader; to which he very heartily consented. 

So, on a day that was agreed upon, he said to his attend- 
ants after dinner (being then at Hereford), “I should 
like to ride on horseback, this fine afternoon, a little way 
ihto the country.” As they, too, thought it would be very 
pleasant to have a canter in the sunshine, they all rode out 
of the town together in a gay little troop. When they 
Game to a fine level piece of turf, the Prince fell to com- 
paring their horses one with another, and offering bets that 
one was faster than another; and the attendants, suspect- 
ing no harm, rode galloping matches until their horses 
were quite tired. The Prince rode no matches himself, 
but looked on from his saddle, and staked his money. 
Thus they passed the whole merry afternoon. Now, the 
sun was setting, and they were all going slowly up a hill, 
the Prince’s horse very fresh and all the other horses very 
weary, when a strange rider mounted on a grey steed ap- 
peared at the top of the hill, and waved his hat. “ What 
does the fellow mean? w said the attendants one to another.

The Prince answered on the instant by setting spurs to his 
horse, dashing away at his utmost speed, joining the man; 
riding into the' midst of a little crowd of horsemen who 
were then seen waiting under some trees, and who closed 
around him; and so he departed in a cloud of dust, leaving 
the road empty of all but the baffled attendants, who sat 
looking at one another, while their horses drooped their 
ears and panted. 

The Prince joined the Earl of Gloucester at Ludlow. 
The Earl of Leicester, with a part of the army and the 
stupid old King, was at Hereford. One of the Earl of 
Leicester’s sons, Simon de Montfort, with another part of 
the army, was in Sussex. To prevent these two parts 
from uniting was the Prince’s first object. He attacked 
Simon de Montfort by night, defeated him, seized his ban- 
ners and treasure, and forced him into Kenilworth Castle 
in Warwickshire, which belonged to his family. 

His father, the Earl of Leicester, in the meanwhile, not 
knowing what had happened, marched out of Hereford, 
with his part of the army and the King, to meet him. He 
came, on a bright morning in August, to Evesham, which 
is watered by the pleasant river Avon. Looking rather 
anxiously across the prospect towards Kenilworth, he saw 
his own banners advancing; and his face brightened with 
joy. But, it clouded darkly when he presently perceived 
that the banners were captured, and in the enemy’s hands; 
and he said, “ It is over. The Lord have mercy on our 
souls, for our bodies are Prince Edward’s! ” 

He fought like a true Knight, nevertheless. When his 
horse was killed under him, he fought on foot. It was a 
fierce battle, and the dead lay in heaps everywhere. The 
old King, stuck up in a suit of armour on a big war-horse, 
which didn’t mind him at all, and which carried him into 
all sorts of places where he didn’t want to go, got into 
everybody’s way, and very nearly got knocked on the head 
by one Of his son’s men. But he managed to pipe out, “I 
am Harry of Winchester! ” and the Prince, who heard him, 
seized his bridle, and took him out of peril. The Earl of 
Leicester still fought bravely, until his best son Henry ^ as 
killed, and the bodies of his best friends choked his path;' 
and then he fell, still fighting, sword in hand. They man- 
gled his body, and sent it as a present to a noble lady — but 
a very unpleasant lady, I should think — who was the wife

of his worst enemy. They could not mangle his , memory 
in the minds of the faithful people, though. Many years 
afterwards, they loved him more than ever, and regarded 
him as a Saint, and always spoke of him as “ Sir Simon the 
Righteous.” 

And even though he was dead, , the cause for which he 
had fought still lived, and was strong, and forced itself 
upon the King in the very hour of victory. Henry found 
himself obliged to respect the Great Charter, however much 
he hated it, and to make laws similar to the laws of the 
Great Earl of Leicester, and to be moderate and forgiving 
towards the people at last— even towards the people of 
London, who had so long opposed him. There were more 
risings before all this was done, but they were set at rest 
by these means, and Prince Edward did his best in all 
things to restore peace. One Sir Adam de Gourdon was 
the last dissatisfied knight in arms; but, the Prince van- 
quished him in single combat, in a wood, and nobly gave 
him his life, and became his friend, instead of slaying him. 
Sir Adam was not ungrateful. He ever afterwards re- 
mained devoted to his generous conqueror. 

When the troubles of the Kingdom were thus calmed, 
Prince Edward and his cousin Henry took the Cross, and 
went away to the Holy Land, with , many English Lords 
and Knights. Four years afterwards the King of the Ro- 
mans died, and, next year (one thousand two hundred and 
seventy-two), his brother the weak King of England died. 
He was sixty-eight years old then, and had reigned fifty- 
six years. He was as much of a King in death, as he had 
ever been in life. He was the mere pale shadow of a King 
at all times. 


CHAPTER XVI. 

ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIRST, CALLED 
LONGSHANKS. 

It was now the yqar of our Lord one thousand two hun- 
dred and seventy- two; and Prince Edward, the heir to the 
throne, being away in the Holy Land, knew nothing of his 
father’s death. The Barons, however, proclaimed him 
King, immediately after the Royal funeral; and the people

very willingly consented, since most men knew too well by 
this time what the horrors of a contest for the crown were. 
So King Edward the First, called, in a not very compli- 
mentary manner, Longshanks, because of the slenderness 
of his legs, was peacefully accepted by the English Nation, 
His legs had need to be strong, however long and thin 
they were; for they had to support hini through many 
difficulties on the fiery sands of Asia, where his small force 
of soldiers fainted, died, deserted, and seemed to melt 
away. But his prowess made light of it, and he said, “I 
will go on, if I go on with no other follower than my 
groom l” ■ 

A Prince of this spirit gave the Turks a deal of trouble. 
He stormed Nazareth^ at which place, of all places on 
earth, I am sorry to relate, he made a frightful slaughter 
of innocent people; and then he went to Acre, where he 
got a truce of ten years from the Sultan. He had very 
nearly lost his life in Acre, through the treachery of a Sar- 
acen Noble, called the Emir of Jaffa, who, making the 
pretence that he had some idea of turning Christian and 
wanted to know all about that religion, sent a trusty mes- 
senger to> Edward very often — with a dagger in his sleeve. 
At last, one 1 Eriday in Whitsun week, when it was very 
hot, and all the sandy prospect lay beneath the blazing sun, 
burnt up like a great overdone biscuit, and Edward was ly- 
ing on a couch, dressed for coolness in only a loose robe, 
the messenger, with his chocolate-coloured face and his 
bright dark eyes and white teeth, came creeping in with a 
letter, and kneeled down like a tame tiger. But, the mo- 
ment Edward stretched out his hand to take the letter, the 
tiger made a spring at his heart. He was quick, but Ed- 
ward was quick too: He seized the traitor by his choco- 
late throat, threw him to the ground, and slew him 1 with 
the very dagger he had drawn.. The weapon had struck 
Edward in the arm, and although the wound itself waS 
slight, it threatened to be mortal, for the blade of the dag- 
ger had been smeared with poison. Thanks, however, to 
a better surgeon than was often to be found in those times, 
and to some wholesome herbs, and above all, to his faith- 
ful wife, Eleanoh, who devotedly nursed him, and is said 
by some to have sucked the poison from the wound with 
her own red lips (which I am very willing to believe), Ed- 
ward soon reopvered and was sound again.

As the King his father had sent entreaties to him to re- 
turn home, he now began the journey. He had got as far 
as Italy, when he met messengers who brought him intelli- 
gence of the King’s death. Hearing that all was quiet at 
home, he made no haste to return to his own dominions, 
but paid a visit to the Pope, and went in state through 
various Italian Towns, where he was welcomed with accla- 
mations as a mighty champion of the Cross from the Holy 
Land, and where he received presents of purple mantles 
and prancing horses, and went along in great triumph. 
The shouting people little knew that he was the last Eng- 
lish monarch who would ever embark in a crusade, or that 
within twenty years every conquest which the Christians 
had made in the Holy Land at the cost of so much blood, 
would be won back by the Turks. But all this came to 
pass. 

There was, and there is, an old town standing in a plain 
in France, railed Ch&lons. When the King was coming 
towards this place on his way to England, a wily French 
Lord, called the Count of Ch&lons, sent him a polite chal- 
lenge to come with his knights and hold a fair tournament 
with the Count and his knights, and make a day of it with 
sword and lance. It was represented to the King that the 
Count of Ch&lons was not to be trusted, and that, instead 
of a holiday fight for mere show and in good humour, he 
secretly meant a real battle, in which the English should 
be defeated by superior force. 

The King, however, nothing afraid, went to the appoint- 
ed place on the appointed day with a thousand followers. 
When the Count came with two thousand and attacked the 
English in earnest, the English rushed at them with such 
valour that the Count’s men and the Count’s horses soon 
began to be tumbled down all over the field. The Count 
himself seized the King round the neck, but the King tum- 
bled him out of his saddle in return for the compliment, 
and, jumping from his own horse, and standing over him, 
beat away at his iron armour like a blacksmith hammering 
Qn his anvil. Even when the Count owned himself defeated 
and offered his sword, the King would not do him the hon- 
our to take it, but made him yield it up to a common sol- 
dier. There had been such fury shown in this fight, that 
it was afterwards called the little Battle of Ch&lons. 

The English were very well disposed to be proud of their

King after these adventures; so, when he landed at Dover 
in the year one thousand two hundred and seventy-four 
(being then thirty-six years old), and went on to Westmin- 
ster where he and his good queen were crowned with great 
magnificence, splendid rejoicings took place. For the coro- 
nation-feast there were provided, among other eatables, 
four hundred oxen, four hundred sheep, four hundred and 
fifty pigs, eighteen wild boars, three hundred flitches of 
bacon, and twenty thousand fowls. The fountains and 
conduits in the street flowed with red and white wine in- 
stead of water; the rich citizens hung silks and cloths of 
the brightest colours out of their windows to increase the 
beauty of the show, and threw out gold and silver by whole 
handfuls to make scrambles for the crowd. In short, 
there was such eating and drinking, such music and caper- 
ing, such a ringing of bells and tossing of caps, such a 
shouting, and singing, and revelling, as the narrow over- 
hanging streets of old London City had not witnessed for 
many a long day. All the people were merry — except the 
poor Jews, who, trembling within their houses, and scarcely 
daring to peep out, began to foresee that they would have 
to find the money for this joviality sooner or later. 

To dismiss this sad subject of the Jews for the present, 
I am sorry to add that in this reign they were most unmer- 
cifully pillaged. They were hanged in great numbers, on 
accusations of having clipped the King’s coin — which all 
kinds of people had done. They were heavily taxed; they 
were disgracefully badged; they were, on one day, thirteen 
years after the coronation, taken up with their wives and 
children and thrown into beastly prisons, until they piu ,: 
chased their release by paying to the King twelve thousand 
pounds. Finally, every kind of property belonging to 
them was seized by the King, except so little as would de- 
fray the charge of their taking themselves away into for- 
eign countries. Many years elapsed before the hope of 
gain induced any of their race to return to England, where 
they had been treated so heartlessly and had suffered so 
much. 

If King Edward the First had been as bad a King to 
Christians as he was to Jews, he would have been bad in- 
deed. But he was, in general, a wise and great monarch, 
under whom the country much improved. He had no love 
for the Great Charter — few Kings had, through many

many years — but he had high qualities. The first bold 
object which he conceived when he came home, was to unite, 
under one Sovereign, England, Scotland, and Wales; the 
two last of which countries had each a little king of its 
own, about whom the people were always quarrelling and 
fighting, and making a prodigious disturbance — a great deal 
more than he was worth. In the course, of King Edward’s 
reign he was engaged, besides, in a war with France. To 
make these quarrels clearer, we will separate their histories 
and take them thus. Wales, first. France, second. Scot- 
land, third. 

Llewellyn was the Prince of Wales. He had been qn 
the side of the Barons in the reign of the stupid old King, 
but had afterwards sworn allegiance to him. When King 
Edward came to the throne, Llewellyn was required to 
swear allegiance to him also; which he refused to do. The 
King, being crowned and in his own dominions, three times 
more required Llewellyn to come and do homage; and 
three times more Llewellyn said he would rather not* He 
was going to be married to Eleanor oe Montfort, a 
young lady of the family mentioned in the last reign; and 
it chanced that this young lady, coming from France with 
her youngest brother, Emeric, was taken by an English 
ship, and was ordered by the English King to be detained. 
Upon this, the quarrel came to a head. The King went, 
with his fleet, to the coast of Wales, where, so encompass- 
ing Llewellyn, that he could only take refuge in the bleak 
mountain region of Snowdon in which no provisions could 
reach him, he was soon starved into an apology, and into a 
treaty of peace, and into paying the expenses of, the war. 
The King, however, forgave him some of the hardest con- 
ditions of the treaty, and consented to his marriage. And 
he now thought he had reduced Wales to obedience. 

But, the Welsh, although they were naturally a gentle, 
quiet, pleasant people, who liked to receive strangers in 
their cottages among the mountains, and to set before them 
with free hospitality whatever they had to eat and drink, 
and to play to them on their harps, and sing their native 
ballads to them, were a people of great spirit when their 
blood was up. Englishmen, after this affair, beg^n to be 
insolent in Wales, and to assume the air of masters; and the 
Welsh pride could not bear it. Moreover, they believed in

that unlucky old Merlin, some of whose unlucky old proph- 
ecies somebody always seemed doomed to remember, when 
there was a chance of its doing harm; and just at this time 
some blind old gentleman with a harp and a long white 
beard, who was an excellent person, but had become of an 
unknown age and tedious, burst out with a declaration that 
Merlin had predicted that when English money had become 
round, a, Prince of Wales would be crowned in London. 
Now, King Edward had recently forbidden the English 
penny to be cut into halves and quarters for halfpence and 
farthings, and had actually introduced a round coin; 
therefore, the Welsh people said this ;was the time Merlin 
meant, and rose accordingly. 

King Edward had bought over Prince David, Llewel- 
lyn’s brother, by heaping favours upon hiiuj b,pt he was 
the first to revolt, being perhaps troubled in Ixis conscience. 
One stormy night, he surprised the Castle of Hawarden, in 
possession of which an English noblepian had been left; 
killed the whole garrison, and carried off the nobleman a 
prisoner to Snowdon. Upon this, the Welsh people rose ^ 
like one man. King Edward, with his .army, marching 
from Worcester to the Menai Strait,, crossed it — near to. 
where the wonderful tubular iron bridge now, in days so 
different, makes a passage for railway trains — by a bridge 
of boats that enabled .forty men to march abreast. He 
subdued the Island of Anglesea, and sent his men forward 
to observe the enemy. The sudden appearance of the 
Welsh created a panic among them, and they fell back to 
the bridge. The tide had in the meantime risen and sepa- 
rated the boats; the Welsh pursuing them, they were 
driven into the sea, and there they sunk, in their heavy 
iron armour, by thousands. After this victory Llewellyn, 
helped by the severe win ter- weather of Wales, gained an- 
other battle; but the King ordering a portion of his Eng- 
lish army to advance through South Wales,, and catch him 
between two foes, and Llewellyn bravely turning to meet 
this new enemy, he was surprised and killed — very meanly, 
for he was unarmed and defenceless. His head was struck 
off and sent to London, where it was fixed upon the Tower, 
encircled with a wreath, some say of ivy, some say of wil- : 
low, some say of silver, to make it look like a ghastly coin 
in ridicule of the prediction. 

David, however, still held oqt for six months, though

eagerly sought after by the King, and hunted by his own 
countrymen. One of them finally betrayed him with his 
wife and children. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, 
and quartered; and from that time this became the estab- 
lished punishment of Traitors in England — a punishment 
wholly without excuse, as being revolting, vile, and cruel, 
after its object is dead; and which has no sense in it, as 
its only real degradation (and that nothing can blot out) 
is to the country that permits on any consideration such 
abominable barbarity. 

Wales was now subdued. The Queen giving birth to a 
young prince in the Castle of Carnarvon, the King showed 
him to the Welsh people as their countryman, and called 
him Prince of Wales; a title that has ever since been borne 
by the heir-apparent to the English Throne — which that lit- 
tle Prince soon became, by the death of his elder brother. 
The King did better things for the Welsh than that, by im- 
proving their laws and encouraging their trade. Disturb- 
ances still took place, chiefly occasioned by the avarice and 
pride of the English Lords, on whom Welsh lands and cas- 
tles had been bestowed; but they were subdued, and the 
country never rose again. There is a legend that to pre- 
vent the people from being incited to rebellion by the songs 
of their bards and harpers, Edward had them all put to 
death. Some of them may have fallen among other men 
who held out against the King; but this general slaughter 
is, I think, a fancy of the harpers themselves, who, I dare 
say, made a song about it many years afterwards, and 
sang it by the Welsh firesides until it came to be believed. 

The foreign war of the reign of Edward the First arose in 
this way. The crews of two vessels, one a Norman ship, 
and the other an English ship, happened to go to the same 
place in their boats to fill their casks with fresh water. 
Being rough angry fellows, they began to quarrel, and then 
to fight — the English with their fists; the Normans with 
their knives — and, in the fight, a Norman was killed. The 
Norman crew, instead of revenging themselves upon those 
English sailors with whom they had quarrelled (who were 
too strong for them, I suspect), took to their ship again in 
a great rage, attacked the first English ship they met, laid 
hold of an unoffending merchant who happened to be on 
board, and brutally hanged him in the rigging of their own

vessel with a dog at his feet. This so enraged the English 
sailors that there was no restraining them; and whenever, 
and wherever, English sailors met Norman sailors, they 
fell upon each other tooth and nail. The Irish and Dutch 
sailors took part with the English; the French and Geno- 
ese sailors helped the Normans; and thus the greater part 
of the mariners sailing over the sea became, in their way, 
as violent and raging as the sea itself when it is disturbed. 

King Edward’s fame had been so high abroad that he 
I had been chosen to decide a difference between France and 
another foreign power, and had lived upon the Continent 
three years. At first, neither he nor the French King 
Philip (the good Lopis had been dead some time) inter- 
fered in these quarrels; but when a fleet of eighty English 
ships engaged and utterly defeated a Norman fleet of two 
hundred, in a pitched battle fought round a ship at anchor, 
in which no quarter was given, the matter became too seri- 
ous to be passed over. King Edward, as Duke of Guienne, 
j was summoned to present himself before the King of France, 

! at Paris, and answer for the damage done by his sailor sub- 

| jects. At first, he sent the Bishop of London as his rep- 

| resentative, and then his brother Edmunp who was married 
! to the French Queen’s mother. I am afraid Edmund was 
an easy man, and allowed himself to be talked over by his 
charming relations, the French court ladies; at all events, 
he was induced to give up his brother’s dukedom for forty 
days — as a mere form, the French King said, to satisfy his 
honour — and he was so very much astonished, when the 
time was out, to find that the French King had no idea of 
| giving it up again, that I should not wonder if it hastened 
his death: which soon took place, 
i King Edward was a King to win his foreign dukedom 
back again, if it could be won by energy and valour. He 
raised a large army, renounced his allegiance as Duke of 
Guienne, and crossed the sea to carry war into France. 
Before any important battle was fought, however, a truce 
was agreed upon for two years; and in the course of that 
time, the Pope effected a reconciliation. King Edward, 
who was now a widower, having lost his affectionate and 
good wife, Eleanor, married the French King’s sister, 
Margaret; and the Prince of Wales was contracted to the 
French King’s daughter Isabella. 

Out of bad things, good things sometimes arise. Out of

this hanging of the innocent merchant, and the bloodshed 
and strife it caused, there came to be established one of the 
greatest powers that the English people now possess. The 
preparations for the war being very expensive, and King 
Edward greatly wanting money, and being very arbitrary 
in his ways of raising it, some of the Barons began firmly 
to oppose him. Two of them, in particular, Humphrey 
Bohun, Earl of Hereford, and Roger Bigod, Earl of Nor- 
folk, were so stout against him, that they maintained he 
had no right to command them to head his forces in Gui- 
enne, and flatly refused to go there. “By Heaven, Sir 
Earl,” said the King to the Earl of Hereford, in a great 
passion? “ you shall either go or be hanged ! ” “ By Heaven, ! 
Sir I^iiig,” replied the Earl, “ I will neither go nor yet will j 

I be hanged ! ” and both he and the other Earl sturdily left ! 

the eourt, attended by many Lords. The King tried every 
riieans of raising, mon6y. He taxed the clergy, in spite of 
all the Pope said to the contrary; and when they refused 
to pay, reduced them to submission, by saying Very well, 
then they had no claim upon the government for protection, 
and any man might plunder them who would — which a 
good many men were very ready to do, and very readily 
did, and which, the clergy found too losing a game to be 
played at Tong. He seized all the wool and leather in the 
hands of the merchants, promising to pay for it some fine 
day; and he set a tax upon the exportation of wool, which 
was so unpopular among the traders that it was called u The 
evil toll.” But all would not do. The Barons, led by 
those two great Earls, declared any taxes imposed without 
the conseiit of Parliament, unlawful; and thO Parliament 
refused to impose taxes, until the King should confirm 
afresh the two Great Charters, and should solemnly declare 
in writing, that there was no power in the country to raise 
money from the people, evermore, but the power of Parlia- 
ment representing all ranks of the people. The King was 
very unwilling to diminish his own power by allowing this 
great privilege in the Parliament; but there was no help 
for it, and he at last complied. We shall come to another 
King by-aml-bye, who might have saved his head from 
rolling off, if he had profited by this example.

good sense and wisdom of this King, Many of the laws

safety of travellers, and the apprehension pf thieves, and 
murderers;, the j priests .were prevented from holding too' 
muchland, and, so becoming too powerful; and Justice# of 
the Peace were first appointed (though not at first . under 
that name) in various parts of the country. 

And now we come to Scotland, which was the great and 
lasting trouble of the reign of King Edward the First. 

. About thirteen years after King Edward’s coronation, 
Alexander the Third, the. King of Scotland, died of a fall 
from his horse. He had been married to Margaret, King 
Edward’s sister. All their children being dead, the Scot- 
tish crown became the right of a young Princess only eight 
years old, the daughter of Eric, King of Norway, who had 
married a daughter of the deceased sovereign. King Ed- 
ward proposed, that the Maiden of Norway, as this Prin- 
cess was called, should be engaged to be married to his 
eldest ,sou; but, unfortunately, as she was coming over to 
England she fell sick, and landing on one of the Orkney 
Islands, died there. A great commotion immediately began 
in Scotland, where as many as thirteen noisy claimants to 
the vacant throne started up and made a general con- 
fusion. 

King Edward being much renowned for his sagacity and 
justice, it seems to have, been agreed to refer the dispute to 
him. He accepted the . trust, and went, with an army, to 
the Border-land where England and Scotland joined. 
There, he called upon the Scottish gentlemen to meet him 
at the Castle of Norham, pn the English side of the river 
Tweed; and, to that Castle they came. But, before he 
would take any step , in the business, he required those 
Scottish gentlemen,, one and all, to do homage to him as 
their, superior Lord; and when they hesitated, he said, “ By 
holy JEdward, whose crown I wear, I will have my rights, 
or I will die in maintaining them! ” The Scottish gentle- 
men, who had not expected this, were disconcerted, and 
asked for three weeks to think about it. , 

At the end of the three weeks, another meeting took 
place, on a green plain on the Scottish side of the rivpr. 
Of all the competitors for the Scottish throne, there were 
only two who had, any real claim, in right of l their .near 
kindred to the Royal family. l*hese were J o h m B a l i o l 
and Robert Brupe : and the right was, I have no doubt.

on the side of John Baliol. At this particular meeting 
John Baliol was not present, but Robert Bruce was; and 
on Robert Bruce being formally asked whether he acknowl- 
edged the King of England for his superior lord, he an- 
swered, plainly and distinctly, Yes, he did. Next day, 
John Baliol appeared, and said the same. This point set- 
tled, some arrangements were made for inquiring into their 
titles. 

The inquiry occupied a pretty long time — more than a 
year. While it was going on, King Edward took the op- 
portunity of making a journey through Scotland, and call- 
ing upon the Scottish people of all degrees to acknowledge 
themselves his vassals, or be imprisoned until they did. In 
the meanwhile, Commissioners were appointed to conduct 
the inquiry, a Parliament was held at Berwick about it, the 
two claimants were heard at full length, and there was a 
vast amount of talking. At last, in the great hall of the 
Castle of Berwick, the King gave judgment in favour of 
John Baliol: who, consenting to receive his crown by the 
King of England’s favour and permission, was crowned at 
Scone, in an old stone chair which had been used for ages 
in the abbey there, at the coronations of Scottish Kings. 
Then, King Edward caused the great seal of Scotland, used 
since the late King’s death, to be broken in four pieces, 
and placed in the English Treasury; and considered that he 
now had Scotland (according to the common saying) under 
his thumb. 

Scotland had a strong will of its own yet, however. 
King Edward, determined that the Scottish King should 
not forget he was his vassal, summoned him repeatedly to 
come and defend himself and his Judges before the Eng- 
lish Parliament when appeals from the decisions of Scot- 
tish courts of justice were being heard. At length, John 
Baliol, who had no great heart of his own, had so much 
heart put into him by the brave spirit of the Scottish peo- 
ple, who took this as a national insult, that he refused to 
come any more. Thereupon, the King further required hii^ 
to help him in his war abroad (which was then in progress), 
and to give up, as security for his good behaviour in future, 
the three strong Scottish Castles of Jedburgh, Roxburgh, 
and Berwick. Nothing of this being done; on the con- 
trary, the Scottish people concealing their King among 
their mountains in the Highlands and showing a determi

nation to resist; Edward marched to Berwick with an army 
of thirty thousand foot, and four thousand horse; tpok the 
Castle, and slew its whole garrison, and the inhabitants 
of the town as well — men, women, and children. Lord 
Warrenne, Earl of Surrey, then went on to the Castle of 
Dunbar, before which a battle was fought, and the whole 
Scottish army defeated with great slaughter. The victory 
being complete, the Earl of Surrey was left as guardian of 
Scotland; the principal offices in that kingdom were given 
to Englishmen; the more powerful Scottish Nobles were 
obliged to come and live in England; the Scottish crown 
and sceptre were brought away; and even the old stone 
chair was carried off and placed in Westminster Abbey, 
where you may see it now. Baliol had the Tower of Lon- 
don lent him for a residence, with permission to range 
about within a circle of twenty miles. Three years after- 
wards he was allowed to go to Normandy, where he had 
estates, and where he passed the remaining six years of his 
life : far more happily, I dare say, than he had lived for a 
long while in angry Scotland. 

Now, there was, in the West of Scotland, a gentleman 
of small fortune, named William Wallace, the second son 
of a Scottish knight. He was a man of great size and 
great strength; he was very brave and daring; when he 
spoke to a body of his countrymen, he could rouse them in 
a wonderful manner by the power of his burning words; he 
loved Scotland dearly, and he hated England with his ut- 
most might. The domineering conduct of the English who 
now held the places of trust in Scotland made them as in- 
tolerable to the proud Scottish people as they had been, 
under similar circumstances, to the Welsh; and no man in 
all Scotland regarded them with so much smothered rage as 
William Wallace. One day, an Englishman in office, little 
knowing what he was, affronted him, Wallace instantly 
struck him dead, and taking refuge among the rocks and 
hills, and there joining with his countryman, Sir William 
Douglas, who was also in arms against King Edward, 
became the most resolute and undaunted champion of a peo- 
ple struggling for their independence that ever lived upon 
the earth. 

The English Guardian of the Kingdom fled before him, 
and, thus encouraged, the Scottish people revolted every- 
where, and fell upon the English without mercy. The

Earl of Surrey, by the King’s commands, raised all the 
power of the Border-counties, and two English armies 
poured into Scotland. Only one Chief,, in the face of those 
armies, stood by Wallace, who,, with a force of forty thou- 
sand 'men, awaited the invaders at a place on the river 
Fortli, within two miles of Stirling. Across the river* 
there was only one poor wooden bridge, called the bridge 
of Kildean — so narrow, that but two men could cross it 
abreast. With his eyes upon this bridge, Wallace posted 
the greater part of his men among some rising grounds, 
and waited calmly. When the English army came up on 
the opposite bank of the river, messengers were sent for- 
ward to offer terms. Wallace sent them back with a defi- 
ance, in the name of the freedom of Scotland. Spmeof the 
officers of the Earl of Surrey in command of the English, 
with their eyes also on the bridge, advised him to be discreet 
and not hasty. He, however, urged to immediate battle 
by some other officers^ and particularly by Cressingham, 
King Edward’s treasurer, and a rash man, gave the word 
of command to advance. One thousand English crossed 
the bridge, two abreast ; the Scottish troops were as mo- 
tionless as stone images. Two thousand English crossed; 
three thousand, four thousand, five. Not a feather, all 
this time, had been seen to stir among the Scottish bonnets. 
Now, they all fluttered. " Forward, one party, to the foot 
of the Bridge ! cried Wallace, ec and let no more English 
cross! The rest, down with me on the five thousand who 
have come over, and cut them all to pieces ! ” It was done, 
in the sight of the whole remainder of the English army, 
who could give no help. Cressingham himself was killed, 
and the Scotch made whips for their horses of his skin. 

King Edward was abroad at thifc time and during the 
successes on the Scottish side which followed, and which 
enabled bold Wallace to win the whole countiyback again, 
and even to ravage the English borders. • But, after a few 
winter months, the King returned, and took the field with 
more than his usual energy. One night, when a kick from 
his horse as they both lay on the ground together Broke 
two of his ribs, and a cry arose that he was killed, he 
leaped into his saddle, regardless of the pain he suffered, 
and rode through the camp. Day theh appearylg, he gave 
the word (still, of course, in that bruised and aching state) 
Fbrward! and led his army on to near Falkirk, where the

Scottish forces were seen drawn up on some stony, ground, 
behind a morass. Here, he defeated Wallace, and killed 
fifteen thousand of his men. With the shattered remain- 
der, Wallace drew back to Stirling; but, being pursued, 
set lire to the town that it might give no help to the Eng- 
lish, and escaped. The inhabitants of Perth afterwards 
set fire to their houses for the same reason, and the King, 
unable to find provisions, was forced to withdraw his 
army. 

Another Robert Bruoe, the grandson of him who had 
disputed the Scottish crown with Baliol, was now in arms 
against the King (that elder Bruce being dead), and also 
John Comyn, Baliol’ s nephew. These two young men 
might agree in opposing Edward, but could agree in noth- 
ing else, as they were rivals for the throne of Scotland. 
Probably it was because they knew this, and knew what 
troubles must arise even if they could hope to get the bet- 
ter of the great English King, that the principal Scottish 
people applied to the Pope for his interference. The Pope, 
on the principle of losing nothing for want of trying to get 
it, very coolly claimed that Scotland belonged to him; but 
this was a little too much, and the Parliament in a friendly 
manner told him so. 

In the spring time of the year one thousand three hun- 
dred and three, the King sent Sir John Seorave, whom 
he made Governor of Scotland, with twenty thousand men, 
to reduce the rebels. Sir J ohn was not as careful as he 
should have been, but eucamped at Rosslyn, near Edin- 
burgh, with his army divided into three parts. The Scot- 
tish forces saw their advantage; fell on each part sepa* 
rately; defeated each; and killed all the prisoners. Then, 
came the King himself once more, as soon as a great army 
could be raised; he passed through the whole north of 
Scotland, laying waste whatsoever came in his way; and 
he took up his winter quarters at Dunfermline. The Scot- 
tish cause now looked so hopeless, that Comyn and the 
other nobles made submission and received their pardons. 
Wallace alone stood out. He was invited to surrender^ 
though on no distinct pledge that his life should be spared; 
but he still defied the, ireful King, and lived among the 
steep crags of the Highland glens, where the eagles made 
their nests, and where the mountain torrents roared, and 
the white snow was deep; and the bitter winds blew round

his unsheltered head, as he lay through many a pitch-dark 
night wrapped up in his plaid. Nothing could break his 
spirit; nothing could lower his courage; nothing could in- 
duce him to forget or to forgive his country’s wrongs. 
Even when the Castle of Stirling, which had long held out, 
was besieged by the King with every kind of military en- 
gine then in use; even when the lead upon cathedral roofs 
was taken down to help to make them; even when the 
King, though an old man, commanded in the siege as if he 
were a youth, being so resolved to conquer; even when the 
brave garrison (then found with amazement to be not two 
hundred people, including several ladies) were starved and 
beaten out and were made to submit on their knees, and 
with every form of disgrace that could aggravate their suf- 
ferings; even then, when there was not a ray of hope in 
Scotland, William Wallace was as proud and firm as if he 
had beheld the powerful and relentless Edward lying dead 
at his feet. 

Who betrayed William Wallace in the end, is not quite 
certain. That he was betrayed — probably by an attendant 
— is too true. He was taken to the Castle of Dumbarton, 
under Sir John Menteith, and thence to London, where 
the great fame of his bravery and resolution attracted im- 
mense concourses of people to behold him. He was tried 
in Westminster Hall, with a crown of laurel on his head — 
it is supposed because he was reported to have said that he 
ought to wear, or that he would wear, a crown there — and 
was found guilty as a robber, a murderer, and a traitor. 
What they called a robber (he said to those who tried him) 
he was, because he had taken spoil from the King’s men. 
What they called a murderer, he was, because he had slain 
an insolent Englishman. What they called a traitor, he 
was not, for he had never sworn allegiance to the King, 
and had ever scorned to do it. He was dragged at the 
tails of horses to West Smithfield, and there hanged on a 
high gallows, torn open before he was dead, beheaded, and 
quartered. His head was set upon a pole on London 
Bridge, his right arm was sent to Newcastle, his left am 
to Berwick, his legs to Perth and Aberdeen. But, if King 
Edward had had his body cut into inches, and had sent 
every separate inch into a separate town, he could not have 
dispersed it half so far and wide as his fame. Wallace 
will be remembered in songs and stories, while there are

songs and stories in the English tongue, and Scotland will 
hold him dear while her lakes and mountains last. 

Released from this dreaded enemy, the King made a 
fairer plan of Government for Scotland, divided the offices 
of honour among Scottish gentlemen and English gentle- 
men, forgave past offences, and thought, in his old age, 
that his work was done. 

But he deceived himself. Comyn and Bruce conspired, 
and made an appointment to meet at Dumfries, in the 
Church of the Minorites. There is a story that Comyn was 
false to Bruce, and had informed against him to the King; 
that Bruce was warned of his danger and the necessity of 
flight, by receiving, one night as he sat at supper, from his 
friend the Earl of Gloucester, twelve pennies and a pair of 
spurs; that as he was riding angrily to keep his appointment 
(through a snow-storm, with his horse’s shoes reversed that 
he might not be tracked), he met an evil-looking serving 
man, a messenger of Comyn, whom he killed, and concealed 
in whose dress he found letters that proved Comyn’ s treach- 
ery. However this may be, they were likely enough to 
quarrel in any case, being hot-headed rivals; and, whatever 
they quarrelled about, they certainly did quarrel in the 
church where they met, and Bruce drew his dagger and 
stabbed Comyn, who fell upon the pavement. When 
Bruce came out, pale and disturbed, the friends who were 
waiting for him asked what was the matter? “ I think I 
have killed Comyn,” said he. “ You only think so?” re- 
turned one of them; “ I will make sure ! ” and going into the 
church, and finding him alive, stabbed him again and 
again. Knowing that the King would never forgive this 
new deed of violence, the party then declared Bruce King 
of Scotland: got him crowned at Scone — without the chair; 
and set up the rebellious standard once again. 

When the King heard of it he kindled with fiercer anger 
than he had ever shown yet. He caused , the Prince of 
Wales and two hundred and seventy of the young nobility 
to be knighted — the trees in the Temple Gardens were cut 
down to make room for their tents, and they watched their 
armour all night, according to the old usage : some in the 
Temple Church : some in Westminster Abbey — and at the 
public Feast which then took place, he swore, by Heaven, 
and by two swans covered with gold network which his 
minstrels placed upon the table, that he would avenge the

death of Comyn, and would punish the false Bruce. And 
before all the company, he charged the Prince his son, in 
case that he should die before accomplishing his vow, not 
to bury him until it was fulfilled. Next morning the 
Prince and the rest of the young Knights rode away to the 
Border-countiy to join the English army; and the King, 
now weak and sick, followed in a horse-litter. 

Bruce, after losing a battle and undergoing many dan- 
gers and much misery, fled to Ireland, where he lay con- 
cealed through the winter. That winter, Edward passed I 
in hunting down and executing Bruce’s relations and ad- ! 
herents, sparing neither youth nor age, and showing no I 
touch of pity or sign of mercy. In the following spring, I 
Bruce reappeared and gained some victories. In these 
frays, both sides were grievously cruel. For instance — 
Bruce’s two brothers, being taken captives desperately 
wounded, were ordered by the King to instant execution. 
Bruce’s friend Sir John Douglas, taking his own Castle of 
Douglas out of the hands of ail English Lord, roasted the 
dead bodies of the slaughtered garrison in a great fire made 
of every movable within it; which dreadful cookery his 
men called the Douglas Larder. Bruce, still successful, 
however, drove the Earl of Pembroke and the Earl of 
Gloucester into the Castle of Ayr and laid siege to it. 

The King, Who had been laid up all the winter, but had 
directed the army from his sick-bed, now advanced to Car- 
lisle, and there, causing the litter in which he had travelled 
to be placed in the Cathedral as an offering to Heaven, 
mounted his horse once more, and for the last time. He 
was now sixty-nine years old, and had reigned thirty-five 
years. He was so ill, that in four days he could go no 
more than six miles; still, even at that pace, he went on 
and resolutely kept his face towards the Border. At 
length, he lay down at /the village of Burgh-upon-Sands; 
and there, telling those around him to impress upon the 
Prince that he was to remember his father’s vow, and wafc 
never to rest until he had thoroughly subdued Scotland, he 
yielded up his last breath.

CHAPTER XVI L 

ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SECOND. 

King Ed, warp tpe Second, the first Prince of Wales, 
was twenty-three years 1 old when his father died. There 
was a certain favourite of his,, a y.pung man from Gascopy, 
named Piers Gaveston, . of wjiom his father had so much 
disapproved that he had ordered him. out of England, and' 
had made his son swear by the side of his sick-bed) never 
to bring him back. Put, the. Prince no sooner found him- 
self King, than he broke his oath, as so many other Princes 
and Kings did (they were far too ready to take .oaths), 
and sent for his dear friend immediately. 

Now, this same Gaveston was handsome enough, but 
was a reckless, insolent, audacious fellow. He was detested 
by the proud English Lords ; not only because he had such 
power oyer the King, and made the Court such a dissipated 
place, but, also, .because he could. ri,de better than they at 
tournaments, and was used, in his impudencq, to cut very 
bad jokes on them; calling one, the old hog; another, the 
stage-player; another, the Jew; another, the black dog of 
Ardenne. This was as poor wit as need be, but it made 
those Lords very wroth; and the surly Earl of Warwick, 
who was the black dog, swore that the time should come 
when Piers Gaveston should feel the blapk dog’s teeth. 

It was not,CQtne yet, however, nor did it seeip to be com- 
ing. The King .made him Earl of Cornwall, and gave him 
vast riches; and, when the King went over to France to 
marry the French Princess, Isabella, daughter of Philip 
lb Bel : who was said to be the most beautiful woman ip 
the world : he made Gayeeton, Regent of the Kingdom. 
His splendid marriage-ceremony in the Church of Our Lady 
at Boulogne* where there were four Kings and three Queens 
present (quite a pack of Court Cards, for f dare say the 
Knaves were not wanting), being over, he seemed to care 
little or nothing for his beautiful wife; but was wild with 
impatience to meet GayestuP again.

body else, but rap into the fayourite’s arms before a gi^at

concourse of people, and hugged him, and kissed him, and 
called him his brother. At the coronation which soon fol- 
lowed, Gaveston was the richest and brightest of all the 
glittering company there, and had the honour of carrying 
the crown. This made the proud Lords fiercer than ever; 
the people, too, despised the favourite, and would never 
call him Earl of Cornwall, however much he complained to 
the King and asked him to punish them for not doing so, 
but persisted in styling him plain Piers Gaveston. 

The Barons were so unceremonious with the King in giv- 
ing him to understand that they would not bear this favour- 
ite, that the King was obliged to send him out of the coun- 
try. The favourite himself was made to take an oath 
(more oaths!) that he would never come back, and the 
Barons supposed him to be banished in disgrace, until they 
heard that he was appointed Governor of Ireland. Even 
this was not enough for the besotted King, who brought 
him home again in a year’s time, and not only disgusted 
the Court and the people by his doting folly, but offended 
his beautiful wife too, who never liked him afterwards. 

He had now the old Royal want — of money — and the 
Barons had the new power of positively refusing to let him 
raise any. He summoned a Parliament at York ; the Bar- 
ons refused to make one, while the favourite was near him. 
He summoned another Parliament at Westminster, and 
sent Gaveston away. Then, the Barons came, completely 
armed, and appointed a committee of themselves to correct 
abuses in the state and in the King’s household. He got 
some money on these conditions, and directly set off with 
Gaveston to the Border-country, where they spent it in 
idling away the time, and feasting, while Bruce made ready 
to drive the English out of Scotland. For, though the old 
King had even made this poor weak son of his swear (as 
some say) that he would not bury his bones, but would

The committee of Nobles, after some months of delibera-

sary, instead of summoning it only when he chose.

this time, on pain of death if he ever came back. The 
King’s tears were of no avail ; he was obliged to send his 
favourite to Flanders. As soon as he had done so, how- 
ever, he dissolved the Parliament, with the low cunning of 
a mere fool, and set off to the North of England, thinking 
to get an army about him to oppose the Nobles. And once 
again he brought Gaveston home, and heaped upon him all 
the riches and titles of which the Barons had deprived him. 

The Lords saw, now, that there was nothing for it but 
to put the favourite to death. They could have done so, 
legally, according to the terms of his banishment ; but they 
did so, I am sorry to say, in a shabby manner. Led by 
the Earl of Lancaster, the King’s cousin, they first of all 
attacked the King and Gaveston at Newcastle. They had 
time to escape by sea, and the mean King, having his 
precious Gaveston with him, was quite content to leave his 
lovely wife behind. When they were comparatively safe, 
they separated ; the King went to York to collect a force 
of soldiers ; and the favourite shut himself up, in the mean- 
time, in Scarborough Castle overlooking the sea. This 
was what the Barons wanted. They knew that the Castle 
could not hold out ; they attacked it, and made Gaveston 
surrender. He delivered himself up to the Earl of Pem- 
broke — that Lord whom he had called the Jew— on the 
Earl’s pledging his faith and knightly word, that no harm 
should happen to him and no violence be done him. 

Now, it was agreed with Gaveston that he should be 
taken to the Castle of Wallingford, and there kept in hon- 
ourable custody. They travelled as far as Dedington, 
near Banbury, where, in the Castle of that place, they 
stopped for a night to rest. Whether the Earl of Pembroke 
left his prisoner there, knowing what would happen, or 
really left him thinking no harm, and only going (as he 
pretended) to visit his wife, the Countess, who was in the 
neighbourhood, is no great matter now ; in any case, he 
was bound as an honourable gentleman to protect his pris- 
oner, and he did not do it. In the morning, while the fa- 
vourite was yet in bed, he was required to dress himself 
and come down into the courtyard. He did so without any 
mistrust, but started and turned pale when he found it full 
of strange armed men. “ I think you know me? ” said 
their leader, also armed from head to foot. “ I am the black 
dog of Ardenne!”

The time was come when Piers Gaveston was to feel the 
black dog’s teeth indeed. They set him on a mule, and 
carried him, in mock state and with military music, to the 
black dog’s kennel — Warwick Castle — where a hasty coun- 
cil, composed of some great noblemen, considered what 
should be done with him. Some were for sparing him, but 
one loud voice — it was the black dog’s bark, I dare say — 
sounded through the Castle Hall, uttering these words: 
“ You have the fox in your power. Let him go now, and 
you must hunt him again.” 

They sentenced him to death. He threw himself at the 
feet of the Earl of Lancaster — the old hog — but the old 
hog was as savage as the dog. He was taken out upon the 
pleasant road, leading from Warwick to Coventry, where 
the beautiful river Avon, by which, long afterwards, Will- 
iam Shakespeare was bom and now lies buried, sparkled 
in the bright landscape of the beautiful May-day ; and 
there they struck off his wretched head, and stained the 
dust with his blood. 

When the King heard of this black deed, in his grief 
and rage he denounced relentless war against Ids Barons, 
and both sides were in arms for half a year. But, it then 
became necessary for them to join their forces against 
Bruce, who had used the time well while they were divided, 
and had now a great power in Scotland. 

Intelligence was brought that Bruce was then besieging 
Stirling Castle, and that the Governor had been obliged to 
pledge himself to surrender it, unless he should be relieved 
before a certain day. Hereupon, the King ordered the 
nobles and their fighting-men to meet him at Berwick; but, 
the nobles cared so little for the King, and so neglected the 
summons, and lost time, that only on the day before that 
appointed for the surrender, did the King find himself at 
Stirling, and even then with a smaller force than he had 
expected. However, he had, altogether, a hundred thou- 
sand men, and Bruce f had not more than forty thousand ; 
but, Bruce’s army was strongly posted in three square col- 
umns, on the ground lying between the Burn or Brook of 
Bannock and the walls of Stirling Castle. 

On the very evening, when the King came up, Bruce did 
a brave act that encouraged his men. He was seen by a 
certain Henry de Bohun, an English Knight, riding about 
before his army on a little horse, with a light battle-axe in

Knight, who was mounted on a strong war-horse, eased ia

throw Bruce 1 by Crushing him 'with* his mere weight, set 
spurs to his great charger, rode oil him, and made a thrust 
at him With his heavy spear. Bruce parried the thrust,, 
and with* one blow of his battle-axe split his skull. 

The Scottish men did; not. forget this, next day when the 
battle raged. Randolph, Bruce’s valiant Nephew, rode, 
with the snaall body of niCU he commanded, into such a 
host of the English^ all shining in polished armour in the 
sunlight) that they seemed to be swallowed up and lost, as 
if they had plungeld into the sea. But, they fought so 
well, and did sfibh dreadful execution, that the English 
staggered. Then* came Bruce himself upon them, with all 
the rest of his* army: While they werethiis hard pressed 
and amazed, there appealed upon the hills what they sup^

As the King’s min had begun in a favourite, so it^ seemed 
likely to end in one. He was too poor a creature to rely 
at all upon himself; and his new favourite was one Hugh 
le Dbspenser, the son of a gentleman of ancient family. 
Hugh was handsome and brave, but he was the favourite of 
a weak King, whom no man cared a rush for, and that was 
a dangerous place to hold. The Nobles leagued against 
him, because the King liked him ; and they lay in wait, 
both for his ruin and his father^. Now, the King had 
married him to the daughter of the late Earl of Gloucester, 
and had given both him and his father great possessions in 
Wales. In their endeavours to extend these, they gave 
violent offence to an angry Welsh gentleman, named John 
de Mowbray, and to divers other angry Welsh gentlemen, 
who resorted to arms, took their castles, and seized their 
estates. The Earl of Lancaster had first placed the favour- 
ite (who was a poor relation of his own) at Court, and he 
considered his own dignity offended by the preference he 
received and the honours he acquired ; so he, and the Bar- 
ons who were his friends, joined the Welshmen, marched 
on London, and sent a message to the King demanding to 
have the favourite and his father banished. At first, the 
King unaccountably took it into his head to be spirited, 
and to fiend them a bold reply ; but when they quartered 
themselves around Holborn and Clerkenwell, and went 
down, armed, to the Parliament at Westminster, he gave 
way, and complied with their demands. 

His turn of triumph came sooner than he expected. It 
arose out of an accidental circumstance. The beautiful 
Queen happening to be travelling, came one night to one of 
the royal castles, and demanded to be lodged and enter- 
tained there until morning. The governor of this castle, 
who was one of the enraged lords, was away, and in his 
absence, his wife refused admission to the Queen ; a scuffle 
took place among the common men on either side, and 
some of the royal attendants were killed. The people, 
who cared nothing for the King, were very angry that their 
beautiful Queen should be thus rudely treated in her own 
dominions; and the King, taking advantage of thU feeling, 
besieged the castle, took it, and then called the two Des- 
pensers home. Upon this, the confederate lords and the 
Welshmen went over to Bruce. The King encountered 
them at Boroughbridge, gained the victory, and took a

number of distinguished prisoners; among them, the Earl 
of Lancaster, now an old man, upon whose destruction he 
was resolved. This Earl was taken to his own cattle of 
Pontefract, and there tried and found guilty by an unfair 
court appointed for the purpose ; he was not even allowed 
to speak in his own defence. He was insulted, pelted, 
mounted on a starved pony without saddle or bridle, car- 
ried out, and beheaded. Eighfc-and-twenty knights were 
hanged, drawn, and quartered. When the King had de- 
spatched this bloody work, and had made a fresh and a 
long truce with Bruce, he took the Despensers into greatei 
favour than ever, and made the father Earl of Winchester. 

One prisoner, and an important one, who was taken at 
Boroughbridge, made his escape, however, arid turned the 
tide against the King. This was Roger MobITDier, 
always resolutely opposed to him, who was sentenced td 
death, and placed for safe custody in the Tower of Londorf; 
He treated his guards to a quantity of wine into which he 
had put a sleeping potion ; and, when they were insensible/ 
broke out of his dungeon, got into a kitchen, Climbed up' 
the chimney, let himself down’from the roof of the build J 
ing with a rope-ladder, passed the sentries, got doWn to tlie 
river, and made away in a boat to where servants and 
horses were waiting for him. He finally escaped to France/ 
where Charles lb Bel, the brother of the beautiful 
Queen, was King. Charles sought to quarrel with the 
King of England, on pretence of his not having come to del 
him homage at his coronation. It was proposed that the 
beautiful Queen should go over to arrange the dispute ; shO 
went, and wrote home to the King, that as he was sick 
and could not come to Franee himself, perhaps it Would be 
better to send over the young Prince, their son, who Was 
only twelve years old, Who could do homage to her brother 
in his stead, and in whose company she would immediately 
return. The King sent him : but, both he and the Queen 
remained at the French Court, and Roger Mortimer beeame 
the Queen's lover. 

When the King wrote, again and again, to the Queen to 
come home, she did not reply that she despised him to6’ 
much to live with him any more (which was the truth),' 
but said she was afraid of the two Desperisers. In short, 
her design was to overthrow the favourites* power, and the 
King** power, such as it was, and invade England. HaV-

If you ever come near Gloucester, and see the centre 
tower of its beautiful Cathedral, with its four pinnacles,

wretched Edward the Second was buried in the old abbey 
of that ancient city, at forty-three years old, after being 
for nineteen years and a half a perfectly incapable King. 


CHAPTER XVIII. 

ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE THIRD. 

f 

Roger Mortimer, the Queen’s lover (who escaped to 
France in the last chapter), was far from profiting by the 
Examples he had had of the fate of favourites. Having, 
through the Queen’s influence, come into possession of the 
estates of the two Despensers, he became extremely proud 
and ambitious, and sought to be the real ruler of England. 
The young King, who was crowned at fourteen years of 
nge with all the usual solemnities, resolved not to bear this, 
and soon pursued Mortimer to his ruin. 

The people themselves were not fond of Mortimer — first, 
because he was a Royal favourite; secondly, because he 
was supposed to have helped to make a peace with Sootland 
which now took place, and in virtue of which the young 
King’s sister Joan, only seven years old, was promised in 
marriage to David, the son and heir of Robert Bruce, who 
was only five years old. The nobles hated Mortimer be- 
cause of his pride, riches, and power. They went so far as 
to take up arms against him ; but were obliged to submit. 
The Earl of Kent, one of those who did so, but who after- 
wards went over to Mortimer and the Queen, was made an 
example of in the following cruel manner : 

He seems to have been anything but a wise old earl ; and 
he was persuaded by the agents of the favourite and the

Queen, that poor King Edward the Second was not really 
dead; and thus was betrayed into writing letters favouring 
his rightful claim to the throne. This was made out to be 
high treason, and he was tried, found guilty, and sentenced 
to be executed. They took the poor old lord outside the 
town of Winchester, and there kept him waiting some three 
or four hours until they could iind somebody to cut off his 
head. At last, a oonvict said he would do it, if the gov- 
ernment would pardon him in return; and they gave him. 
the pardon ; and at one blow he put the Earl of Kent out 
of his last suspense. 

While the Queen was in France, she- found a lovely and 
good young lady, named Philippa, who she thought would 
make an excellent wife for her son. The young King 
married this lady, soon after he came to the throne ; and 
her first child, Edward, Prince of. Wales, afterwards be* 
came celebrated, as we shall presently see, under* the far 
mou8 title of Edward thb Black, Prince. 

The young King, thinking the time ripe for thB downfall 
of Mortimer, took counsel with Lord Montaoute how lie 
should proceed. A Parliament was going , to be held at 
Nottingham, and that lord recommended that the favourite 
should be seized by night in Nottingham Castle, where he 
was sure to be. Now, this, like many other things, was 
more easily said than done; because, to guard against 
treachery , the great gates of the Castle were locked every 
night, and the great keys were carried up-stairs, to the 
Queen, who laid foem under her own pillow. But the Castle 
had a governor, and the governor being Lord Montacute’s 
friend, confided to him how he knew of a secret passage 
under-ground, hidden from observation by the weeds and 
brambles with which it was overgrown; and how, through 
that passage, the conspirators might enter in the dead of 
the night, and go straight to Mortimer’s room. Accord- 
ingly, upon a certain dark night, at midnight, they made 
their way through this dismal plaee : startling the rats,, and 
frightening the owls and bats : and came safely to the bottom 
of the main tower of the Castle, where the King met them, 
and took them np a profoundly dark staircase in a deep 
silenoe. They soon heard the voiee of Mortimer in council 
with some friends; and bursting into the rpom with a sud- 
den noise, took him prisoner. The Queen cried out from 
her bed-chamber, “ Oh, my sweet son, my dear son, spare

my gentle Mortimer ! ” They carried Him off, however^ 
and, before the next Parliament* accused him of* having 
made differences between the- young' Ring and His- mother, 
and of having brought about the death of the Earl of Kent* 1 
and even of the late King ; f dr, as you kiiow by this time, 
when they wanted to get rid of a man in those Wd days, 
they were not very particular of 1 what they accused him.* 
Mortimer was found guilty of all this, and Was Sentenced 
to be hanged at Tyburn* The King shut his mother up in 
genteel confinement, where she passed the rest of her life ; 
and now he became King in earnest. 

The first effort he made was itc* [conquer* Scotland, ' The 
English lords who had lands inSCotlandy finding; that their 
rights were not respected under the late peace, made- war 
on their own account : choosihg for their general, Edward, 
the son of 1 John Balibl, who made such* a -vigorous fight, 
that in less than two months he won the whole Sootfcish 
Kingdom. He was ' joined, whbnithus s triumphant, by the 
King and Parliament; and He ,and< the King Jin ' person be- 
sieged the Scottish forces in Berwick. ’• The whole Scottish 
army coiiiitigto the assistance of < their Countrymen, such a 
furious battle ensued, that thirty thou sail d men' are said to 
have been killed in it. Baliol*was f then clowned King of 
Scotland, doing homage to the King bf England; bub little 
oame of his successes after ally' for the Scottish men rose 
against him, within no tery long timCy and David Brace 
came back within ten years and took his kiirgdbihi ■. . 

Frahce Was a far richer country than Scotland; and the 
King had a much* greater mind to oonquer it, • So, he let 
Scotland alone, and pretended that he had 1 a claim to- the 
French throne in right of his mother.' He had, in reality, 
no claim • at all; but that mattered little in those times. 
He brought over to his cause many little princes and- so ter-* 
eigns, and even courted th& alliance of 'the pbopie of Flan- 
ders— -a busy, working community, whd'had very small 
respect for kings, and whose head man was a brewer. 
With such forces as he raised by ‘these iheansj Edward in- 
vaded France; but he did little by that, 1 except run into 
debt in carrying on the Wat to the -extent! of thbete bundled 
thousand pounds. The next year he did better; gaining a 
great sea-fight in the harbour of Sluy-s. This success, how- 
ever, was very shortlived, for the Flemings took fright* at 
the siege of Saint Omer and ran away, 'lCaviiig their weajr

ons and baggage behind them. • Philip, the Frenoh King, 
coming up with his army, and Edward being very anxious 
to decide the war, proposed to settle the difference by sin- 
gle combat with him, or by a fight of one hundred knights 
on each side. The French King said, he thanked him; 
but being very well as he was, he would rather not. So, 
after some skirmishing and talking, a short peace was made. 

It was soon broken by King Edward’s favouring the 
cause of John, Earl of Montford; a French nobleman, who 
asserted a claim of his Own against the French King, and 
offered to do homage to England for the Crown of France, 
if he could obtain it through England’s help. This French 
lord, himself, was soon defeated by the French King’s son, 
and shut up in a tower in Paris ; but his wife, a courageous 
and beautiful woman, who is said to have had the courage 
of a man, and the heart of a lion, assembled the people of 
Brittany, where She then was ; and, showing them her in- 
fant son, made many pathetic entreaties to them not to de- 
sert her and their young Lord. They took fire at this 
appeal, and rallied round her in the strong castle of Henne- 
bon. Here she was not only besieged without by the French 
under Charles de Blois, but was endangered within by a 
dreary old bishop, who was always representing to the 
people what horrors they must undergo if they were faith- 
ful — first from famine, and afterwards from fire and sword! 
But this noble lady, whose heart never failed her, encour- 
aged her soldiers by her own example ; went from post to 
post like a great general 5 even mounted on horseback fully 
armed, and, issuing from the castle by a by-path, fell upon 
the French camp, set fire tof the tents, and threw the whole 
force into disorder. This done, she got safely back to 
Hennebon again, and was received with loud shouts of joy 
by the defenders of the castle, who had given her up for 
lost. As they were now very short of provisions, however, 
and as they could not dine off enthusiasm, and as the old 
bishop was always saying, a I told you what it would come 
to! ” they began- to lose heart, and to talk of yielding the 
castle up. The brave Countess retiring to an upper room 
and looking with great grief out to sea, where she expected 
relief from England, saw, at this very time, the English 
ships in the distance, and was relieved and rescued ! Sir 
Walter Manning, the English commander, so admired her 
courage, that, being come into the castle with the English

knights, and having made a feast there, he assaulted the 
French by way of dessert, and beat them off triumphantly. 
Then he and the knights came back to the castle with great 
joy; and the Countess who had watched them. from a high 
tower, thanked them with all her heart, and kissed them 
every one. 

This noble lady distinguished herself afterwards in a sea- 
fight with the French off Guernsey, when she was on her 
way to England to ask for more troops. Her great spiiit 
roused another lady, the wife of another French lord 
(whom the French King very barbarously murdered), to 
distinguish herself scarcely less. The time was fast com- 
ing, however, when Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be 
the great star of this French and English war. 

It was in the month of July, in the year one thousand 
three hundred and forty-six, when the King embarked at 
Southampton for France, with an army of about thirty 
thousand men in all, attended by the Prince of Wales and 
by several of the chief nobles. He landed at La Hogue in 
Normandy; and, burning and destroying as he went, ac- 
cording to custom, advanced up the left bank of the river 
Seine, and fired the small towns even close to Paris ; but, 
being watched from the right bank of the river by the 
French King and all his army, it came to this at last, that 
Edward found himself, on Saturday the twenty-sixth of 
August, one thousand three hundred and forty -six, on a 
rising ground behind the little French village of Crecy, 
face to face with the French King’s force. And, although 
the French King had an enormous army — in number more 
than eight times his — he there resolved to beat him or be 
beaten. 

The young Prince, assisted by the Earl of Oxford and 
the Earl of Warwick, led the first division of the English 
army ; two other great Earls led the second ; and the King, 
the third. When the morning dawned, the King received 
the sacrament, and heard prayers, and then, mounted on 
horseback with a white wand in his hand, rode from com- 
pany to company, and rank to rank, cheering and encour- 
aging both officers and men. Then the whole army break- 
fasted, each man sitting on the ground where he had stood; 
and then they remained quietly on the ground with their 
weapons ready. 

Up came the French King with all his great force. It

was dark and angry weather; there was an eclipse of the 
sun; there was a thunder-storm, accompanied with tre- 
mendous rain ; the frightened birds flew screaming above 
the soldiers’ heads. A certain captain in the French army 
advised the French King, who was by no means cheerful, 
not to begin the battle until the morrow. The King, tak- 
ing this advice, gave the word to halt. But, those behind 
not understanding it, or desiring to be foremost with the 
rest, came pressing on. The roads for a great distance 
were covered with this immense army, and with the com- 
mon people from the villages, who were flourishing their 
rude weapons, and making a great noise. Owing to these 
circumstances, the French army advanced in the greatest 
confusion ; every French lord doing what he liked with his 
own men, and putting out the men of every other French 
lord. 

Now, their King relied strongly upon a great body of 
cross-bowmen from Genoa; and these he ordered to the 
front to begin the battle, on finding that he could not stop 
it. They shouted once, they shouted twice, they shouted 
three times, to alarm the English archers ; but, the English 
would have heard them shout three thousand times and 
would have never moved. At last the cross-bowmen went 
forward a little, and began to discharge their bolts ; upon 
which, the English let fly such a hail of arrows, that the 
Genoese speedily made off — for their cross-bows, besides 
being heavy to carry, required to be wound up with a han- 
dle, and consequently took time to re-load ; the English, 
on the other hand, could discharge their arrows almost as 
fast as the arrows could fly. 

When the French King saw the Genoese turning, he 
cried out to his men to kill those scoundrels, who were do- 
ing harm instead of service. This increased the confusion. 
Meanwhile the English archers, continuing to shoot as fast 
as ever, shot down great numbers of the French soldiers 
and knights $ whom certain sly Comishmen and Welshmen, 
from the English army, creeping along the ground, de- 
spatched with great knives. 

The Prince and his division were at this time so hard- 
pressed, that the Earl of Warwick sent a message to the 
King, who was overlooking the battle from a windmill, 
beseeching him to send more aid. 

“ Is my son killed? ” eaid the King.

"No, sire, please God,” returned the messenger. 

"Is he wounded? ” said the King. 

"No, sire.” 

" Is he thrown to the ground? ” said the King. 

"No, sire, not so; but, he is very hard-presped*” 

" Then,” said the King, " go back to those who sent you, 
and tell them I shall send no aid ; because I set my heart 
upon my son proving himself this day a brave knight, and 
because I am resolved, please God, that the honour of a 
great victory shall be his I ” , 

These bold words, being reported to the Prince and his 
division, so raised their spirits, that they fought better than 
ever. The King of France charged gallantly with his men 
many times; but it was of no use. Night closing in, his 
horse was killed under him by an English arrow, and the 
knights and nobles who had clustered thick about him ear- 
ly in the day, were now completely scattered. At last, 
some of his few remaining followers led him off the field 
by force, since he would not retire of himself, and they 
journeyed away to Amiens. , The victorious English, light- 
ing their watch-fires, made merry on the field, and the 
King, riding to meet his gallant son, took him in his arms, 
kissed him, and told him that he had acted nobly, and 
proved himself worthy of the day and, of the crown. 
While it was yet night, King Edward was hardly aware of 
the great victory he had gained ; but, next day, it was dis- 
covered that eleven princes, twelve hundred knights, and 
thirty thousand common men lay dead upon the French 
side* Among , these was the King of Bohemia, an old 
blind man ; who, having been told that his son was wound- 
ed in the battle, and that no force could stand against the 
Black Prince, called to him two knights, put himself on 
horseback between them, fastened the three bridles to- 
gether, and dashed in amoug the English^ where he was 
presently slain. He bore as his crest three white ostrich 
feathers, with the motto Ich dim, signif ying in English " I 
serve.” This crest and motto were taken by the Prints© of 
Wales in remembrance of that famous day* and have been 
borne by the Prince of Wales ever since. 

Five days after this great battle, ,the King laid siege to 
Calais. This siege — ever afterwards memorable — lasted 
nearly a year. In order to starve the inhabitants out, King 
Edward built so mauy wooden houses for the lodgings of

his troops, that it is said theit quarters looked like a seo- 
ond Calais suddenly sprung up around the first. Early in 
the siege, the governor of the town drove out what he called 
the useless mouths, to the number of seventeen hundred 
persons, men and women, young and old. King Edward 
allowed them to pass through his lines, and even fed them, 
and dismissed them with money } but, later in the siege, he 
was not so merciful — dive hundred more, who were after- 
wards driven out, dying of starvation and misery. The 
garrison were so ham-pressed at last, that they sent a let- 
ter to King Philip, telling him that they had eaten all the 
horses, all the dogs, and all the rats and mice that could 
be found in the place ; aiid, that if he did not relieve them, 
they must either surrender to the English, or eat one an- 
other. Philip made one effort to give them relief ; but 
they were so hemmed in by the English power, that he 
could not succeed, and was fain to leave the place. Upon 
this they hoisted the English flag, and surrendered to King 
Edward. u Tell your general,” said he to the humble mes- 
sengers who came out of the town, “ that I require to have 
sent here, six of the most distinguished citizens, bare- 
legged, and in their shirts, with ropes about their necks; 
and let those six men bring with them the keys of the cas- 
tle and the town.” 

When the Governor of Calais related this to the people 
in the Market-place, there was great weeping and distress; 
in the midst of which, one worthy citizen, named Eustace 
de Saint Pierre, rose up and said, that if the six men re- 
quired were not sacrificed, the whole population would be ; 
therefore, he offered himself as the first. Encouraged by 
this bright example, five other worthy citizens rose up one 
after another, and offered themselves to save the rest. Thfc 
Governor, who was too badly wounded to be able to walk, 
mounted a poor old horse that had not been eaten, and con- 
ducted these good men to the gate, while all the people 
cried and mourned. 

Edward received them wrathfully, and ordered the heads 
of the whole six to be struck off. However, the good 
Queen fell upon her knees, and besought the King to give 
them up to her. The King replied, w I wish you had been 
somewhere else ; but I cannot refuse you.” So she had 
them properly dressed, made a feast for them, and sent 
them back with & handsome present, to the great rejoicing

of the whole camp. I hope the people of Calais loved the 
daughter to whom she gave birth soon afterwards, for her 
gentle mother’s sake. 

Now came that terrible disease, the Plague, into Europe, 
hurrying from the heart of China ; and killed the wretched 
people — especially the poor — in such enormous numbers, 
that one-half of the inhabitants of England are related to 
have died of it. It killed the cattle, in great numbers, 
too ; and so few working men remained alive, that there 
were not enough left to till the ground. 

After eight years of differing and quarrelling, the Prince 
of Wales again invaded France with an army of sixty 
thousand men. He went through the south of the country, 
burning and plundering wheresoever he went; while his 
father, who had still the Scottish war upon his hands, did 
the like in Scotland, but was harassed and worried in his 
retreat from that country by the Scottish men, who repaid 
his cruelties with interest. 

The French King, Philip, was now dead, and was suc- 
ceeded by his son John. The Black Prince, called by that 
name from the colour of the armour he wore to set off his 
fair complexion, continuing to burn and destroy in France, 
roused John into determined opposition ; and so cruel had 
the Black Prince been in his campaign, and so severely had 
the French peasants suffered, that he could not find one 
who, for love, or money, or the fear of death, would tell 
him what the French King was doing, or where he was. 
Thus it happened that he came upon the French King’s 
forces, all of a sudden, near the town of Poitiers, and 
found that the whole neighbouring country was occupied 
by a vast French army. “ God help us ! ” said the Black 
Prince, “we must make the best of it.” 

So, on a Sunday morning, the eighteenth of September, 
the Prince — whose army was now reduced to ten thousand 
men in all — prepared to give battle to the French King, 
who had sixty thousand horse alone. While he was so 
engaged, there came riding from the French camp, a 
Cardinal, who had persuaded John to let him offer terms, 
and try to save the shedding of Christian blood. “Save 
my honour,” said the Prince to this good priest, “ and 
save the honour of my army, and I will make any reason- 
able terms.” He offered to give up all the towns, castles, 
and prisoners, he had taken, and to swear to make no war

in France for seven years; but, as John would hear of 
nothing but his surrender, with a hundred of his chief 
knights, the treaty was broken off, and the Prince said 
quietly — “ God defend the right ; we shall fight to-morrow.” 

Therefore, on the Monday morning, at break of day, the 
two armies prepared for battle. The English were posted 
in a strong place, which could only be approached by one 
narrow lane, skirted by hedges on both sides. The French 
attacked them by this lane ; but were so galled and slain 
by English arrows from behind the hedges, that they were 
forced to retreat. Then went six hundred English bow- 
men round about, and, coming upon the rear of the French 
army, rained arrows on them thick and fast. The French 
knights, thrown into confusion, quitted their banners and 
dispersed in all directions. Said Sir John Chandos to the 
Prince, “ Ride forward, noble Prince, and the day is yours. 
The King of France is so valiant a gentleman, that 1 know 
he will never fly, and may be taken prisoner.” Said the 
Prince to this, “ Advance, English banners, in the name 
of God and Saint George ! ” and on they pressed until they 
came up with the French King, fighting fiercely with his 
battle-axe, and, when all his nobles had forsaken him, at- 
tended faithfully to the last by his youngest son Philip, 
only sixteen years of age. Father and son fought well, 
and the King had already two wounds in his face, and had 
been beaten down, when he at last delivered himself to a 
banished French knight, and gave him his right-hand glove 
in token that he had done so. 

The Black Prince was generous as well as brave, and he 
invited his royal prisoner to supper in his tent, and waited 
upon him at table, and, when they afterwards rode into 
London in a gorgeous procession, mounted the French King 
on a fine cream-coloured horse, and rode at his side on a 
little pony. This was all very kind, but I think it was, 
perhaps, a, little theatrical too, and has been made more 
meritorious than it deserved to be ; especially as I am in- 
clined to think that the greatest kindness to the King of 
France would have been not to have shown him to the peo- 
ple at all. However, it must be said, for these acts of 
politeness, that, in course of time, they did much to soften 
the horrors of war and the passions of conquerors. It was 
a long, long time before the common soldiers began to have 
the benefit of such courtly deeds ; but they did at last ; and

thus it is possible that a poor soldier who asked for quarter 
at the battle of Waterloo, or any other such great fight) may 
have owed his life indirectly to Edward the Black Prince. 

At this time there stood in the Strand, in London, a pal- 
ace called the Savoy, which was given Up to the captive 
King of France and his son for their residence. As the 
King of Scotland had now been King Edward’s captive for 
eleven years too, his success was, at this time, tolerably 
complete. The Scottish business was settled bv the pris- 
oner being released under the title of Sir David, King of 
Scotland, and by his engaging to pay a large ransom. The 
state Of France encouraged England tq propose harder 
terms to that country, where the people rose against the 
unspeakable cruelty and barbarity of its nobles ; where the 
nobles rose in turn against the people; where the most 
frightful outrages were committed on. all sides; and where 
the insurrection of the peasants, called the mfturreetion of 
the Jacquerie, from Jacques, a common Christian name 
among the country people of France, aWakened terrors and 
hatreds that have scarcely yet passed away. A treaty 
called the Great Peace, was at last signed, under which 
King Edward agreed to give up the greater pairt of his con- 
quests, and King John to pay, within six years, a ransom 
of three million crowns of gold. He was so beset by his 
own nobles and courtiers for having yielded to these Con- 
ditions— though they could help hint to no better— that he 
came back of his own will to his old paIade«priSon of the 
Savoy, and there died. 

There was' a Sovereign of Castile at that time, called 
Pkdro the Cruel, who deserved the name remarkably 
well: having committed, among other cruelties, a variety 
of murders. This amiable monarch, being driven from kiB 
throne for his crimes, went to th^ province of Bordeaux, 
where the Black Prince— now married to his cousin Joan, 
a pretty widow— was residing, and besought his help. 
The Prince, who took to him much more kindly than a 
prince bf such fame ought to have taken to such a ruffian, 
readily listened to his fair promises, and agreeing to help 
him, sent secret orders to some troublesome disbanded sol- 
diers of his and his father’s, who called themselves the 
Free Companions, and who had been a pest to the French 
people, for some time, to aid this * Pedro. The Prince, 
himself, going into Spain to head the army of relief, soon

set Pedro on his throne again^-where he no sooner found 
himself^ than, of qourse, he behaved like the villain he 
was, broke his word without the least shame, and aban- 
doned all the promises he had made to the Black Prince. 

Now, it had cost the Prince a good deal of money to pay 
soldiers to support this murderous King; and finding 
himself, when he came back disgusted to Bordeaux, not 
only in bad health, but deeply in debt, he began to tax his 
French subjects to pay his creditors. They appealed to 
the French King, Charles ; war again broke out ; and the 
French town of Limoges, which the Prince had greatly 
benefited, went over to the French King. Upon this he 
ravaged the province of which it was the capital; burnt, 
and plundered, and killed in the old sickening way j and 
refused mercy to the prisoners, men, women, and children 
I taken in the offending town, though he was so iU and so 
! much in need of pity himself from Heaven, that he was 
carried in a litter. He lived to come home and make him- 
self popular with the people and Parliament, and he died 
on Trinity Sunday, the eighth of June, one thousand three 
hundred and seventy-six, at forty-six years old. 

The whole nation mournpd for him as one of the most 
renowned and beloved priiKtes it had eV£r had ; and he was 
buried with great lamentations in Canterbury Cathedral. 
Near to the tomb of Edward the Confessor, his monument, 
with his figure, carved in stone, and represented in the old 
black armour, lying on its back, may be seen at this day, 
with an ancient coat of mail, a helmet, and a pair of gaunt- 
lets hanging from a beam above it, which most people like 
to believe were once worn by the Black Prince. 

King Edward did not outlive his renowned son, long, 
He was old, and one Alice Perrers, a beautiful lady, had 
contrived to make him so fond of her in his old age, that 
he could refuse her nothing, and made himself ridiculous. 
She little deserved his love, or — what X dare say she valued 
a great deal more — the jewels of the late Queen, which he 
gave her among other rich presents. She took the very 
ring from his finger on the morning of the day when he 
died, and left him to be pillaged by his faithless servants. 
Only one good priest was true to him, and attended him to 
the last. 

Besides being famous for the great victories I have re- 
lated, the reign of King Edward the Third was rendered

memorable in better ways, by the growth of architecture 
and the erection of Windsor Castle. In better ways still, 
by the rising up of Wickliffe, originally a poor parish 
priest : who devoted himself to exposing, with wonderful 
power and success, the ambition and corruption of the Pope, 
and of the whole church of which he was the head. 

Some of those Flemings were induced to come to Eng- 
land in this reign too, and to settle in Norfolk, where they 
made better woollen cloths than the English had ever had 
before. The Order of the Garter (a very fine thing in its 
way, but hardly so important as good clothes for the na- 
tion) also dates from this period. The King is said to 
have picked up a lady’s garter at a ball, and to have said, 
Honi soit qui mal y pense — in English, “Evil be to him 
who evil thinks of it.” The courtiers were usually glad to 
imitate what the King said or did, and hence from a slight 
incident the Order of the Gaiter was instituted, and became 
a great dignity. So the story goes. 


CHAPTER XIX. 

ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE SECOND. 

Richard, son of the Black Prince, a boy eleven years of 
age, succeeded to the Crown under the title of King Rich- 
ard the Second. The whole English nation were ready to 
admire him for the sake of his brave father. As to the 
lords and ladies about the Court, they declared him to be 
the most beautiful, the wisest, and the best — even of 
princes— whom the lords and ladies about the Court gener- 
ally declare to be the most beautiful, the wisest, and the 
best of mankind. To flatter a poor boy in this base man- 
ner was not a very likely way to develop whatever good was 
in him; and it brought him to anything but a good or 
happy end. 

The Duke of Lancaster, the young King’s uncle — com- 
monly called John of Gaunt, from having been bom at 
Ghent, which the common people so pronounced — was sup- 
posed to have some thoughts of the throne himself ; but, as 
he was not popular, and the memory of the Black Prince 
was, he submitted to his nephew.

The war with France being still unsettled, the Govern- 
ment of England wanted money to provide for the expenses 
that might arise out of it ; accordingly a certain tax, called 
the Poll-tax, which had originated in the last reign, was 
ordered to be levied on the people. This was a tax on 
every person in the kingdom, male and female, above the 
age of fourteen, of three groats (or three fourpenny pieces) 
a year ; clergymen were charged more, and only beggars 
were exempt. 

I have no need to repeat that the common people of Eng- 
land had long been suffering under great oppression. They 
were still the mere slaves of the lords of the land on which 
they lived, and were on most occasions harshly and unjustly 
treated. But, they had begun by this time to think very 
seriously of not bearing quite so much; and, probably, 
were emboldened by that French insurrection I mentioned 
in the last chapter. 

The people of Essex rose against the Poll-tax, and being 
severely handled by the government officers, killed some of 
them. At this very time one of the tax-collectors, going 
his rounds from house to house, at Dartford in Kent came 
to the cottage of one Wat, a tiler by trade, and claimed the 
tax upon his daughter. Her mother, who was at home, 
declared that she was under the age of fourteen ; upon that, 
the collector (as other collectors had already done in dif- 
ferent parts of England) behaved in a savage way, and 
brutally insulted Wat Tyler’s daughter. The daughter 
screamed, the mother screamed. Wat the Tiler, who was 
at work not far off, ran to the spot, and did what any hon- 
est father under such provocation might have done — struck 
the collector dead at a blow. 

Instantly the people of that town uprose as one man. 
They made Wat Tyler their leader; they joined with the 
people of Essex, who were in arms under a priest called 
Jack Straw; they took out of prison another priest named 
John Ball; and gathering in numbers as they went along, 
advanced, in a great confused army of poor men, to Black- 
heath. It is said that they wanted to abolish all property, 
and to declare all men equal. I do not think this very 
likely ; because they stopped the travellers on the roads 
and made them swear to be true to King Richard and the 
people. Nor were they at all disposed to injure those 
who had done thorn no harm, merely because they were

of high station ; for, the King's mother, who had to pass 
through their camp at Blackheath, on her way to her young 
son, lying for safety in the Tower of London, had merely 
to kiss a few dirty-faced rough-bearded men who were 
noisily fond of royalty, and so got away in perfect safety. 
Next day the whole mass marched on to London Bridge. 

There was a drawbridge in the middle, which William 
Walworth the Mayor caused to be raised to prevent their 
coming into the city ; but they soon terrified the citizens 
into lowering it again, and spread themselves, with great 
uproar, over the streets. They broke open the prisons; 
they burned the papers in Lambeth Palace ; they destroyed 
the Duke of Lancaster's Palace, the Savoy, in the 
Strand, said to be the most beautiful and splendid in Eng- 
land; they set fire to the books and documents in the Tem- 
ple ; and made a great riot. Many of these outrages were 
committed in drunkenness ; since those citizens, who had 
well-filled cellars, were only too glad to throw them open 
to save the rest of their property 5 but even the drunken 
rioters were very careful to steal nothing. They were so 
angry with one man, who was seen to take a silver cup at 
the Savoy Palace, and put it in his breast, that they 
drowned him in the river, cup dnd all. 

Thei young King had been taken out to treat with them 
before they committed these excesses ; but, he and the peo- 
ple about him were so frightened by the riotous shouts, 
that they got back to the Tower in the best way they could. 
This made the insurgents bolder ; so they went cm rioting 
away, striking off the heads of those who did not, at a mo- 
ment's notice, declare for King Richard and the people; 
and killing as many of the unpopular persons whom they 
supposed to be their enemies as they could by any means 
lay hold of. In this manner they passed one very violent 
day, and then proclamation was made that the King would 
meet them at Mile-end, and grant their requests. 

The rioters went to Mile-end to the number of sixty 
thousand, and the King met them there, and to the King 
the rioters peaceably proposed four conditions. First, that 
neither they, nor their children, nor any coming after them, 
should be made slaves any more. Secondly, that the rent 
of land should be fixed at a certain price in money, instead 
of being paid in service. Thirdly, that they should have 
liberty to buy and sell in all markets and public places,

like other free men. Fourthly , that they should he par- 
doned for past offences. Heaven knows, there was nothing 
very unreasonable in these proposals! The young King 
deceitfully pretended to think so, and kept thirty clerks 
up, all night, writing out a charter accordingly. 

Now, Wat Tyler himself wanted more than this. He 
wanted the entire abolition of the forest laws. He was 
not at Mile-end with the rest, but, while that meeting was 
being held, broke into the Tower of London and slew the 
archbishop and the treasurer, for whose heads the people 
had cried out loudly the day before. He and his men even 
thrust their swords into the bed of the Princess of Wales 
while the Princess was in it, to make certain that none of 
their enemies were conoealed there. 

So, Wat and his men still continued armed, and rode 
about the city. Next morning, the King with a small train 
of some sixty gentlemen — among whom was Walworth 
the Mayor — rode into Smithfield, and saw Wat and his 
people at a little distance. Says Wat to his men, “ There 
is the King. I will go speak with him, and tell him what 
we want.” 

Straightway Wat rode up to him, and began to talk. 
"King,” says Wat, " dost thou see all my men there? ” 

“ Ah,” says the King. “ Why? ” 

"Because,” says Wat, "they are all at my command, 
and have sworn to do whatever I bid them.” 

Some declared afterwards that as Wat said this, he laid 
his hand on the King’s bridle. Others declared that he 
was seen to play with his own dagger. I think, myself , 
that he just spoke to the King like a rough, angry man as 
he was, and did nothing more* At any rate he was ex- 
pecting no attack, and preparing for no resistance, when 
Walworth the Mayor did the not very valiant deed of 
drawing a short sword and stabbing him in the throat. He 
dropped from his horse, and one of the King’s people 
speedily finished him. Bo fell Wat Tyler. Fawners and 
flatterers made a mighty triumph of it, and set up a cry 
whioh will ocdasibnally find an echo to this day. But Wat 
was a hard-working man, who had suffered much, and had 
been foully outraged j audit is probable that he was a man 
of a much higher nature ahd a much braver spirit than any 
of the parasites who exalted, then, or have exulted since, 
o vet his defeat, <

Seeing Wat down, his men immediately bent their bows 
to avenge his fall. If the young King had not had pres- 
ence of mind at that dangerous moment, both he and the 
Mayor to boot might have followed Tyler pretty fast. But 
the King riding up to the crowd, cried out that Tyler was 
a traitor, and that he would be their leader. They were 
so taken by surprise, that they set up a great shouting, and 
followed the boy until he was met at Islington by a large 
body of soldiers. 

The end of this rising was the then usual end. As soon 
as the King found himself safe, he unsaid all he had said, 
and undid all he had done ; some fifteen hundred of the 
rioters were tried (mostly in Essex) with great rigour, and 
executed with great cruelty. Many of them were hanged 
on gibbets, and left there as a terror to the country people ; 
and, ,because their miserable friends took some of the bod- 
ies down to bury, the King ordered the rest to be ehained 
up — which was the beginning of the barbarous custom of 
hanging in chains. The King’s falsehood in this business 
makes such a pitiful figure, that I think Wat Tyler appears 
in history as beyond comparison the truer and more respect- 
able man of the two. 

Richard was now sixteen years of age, and married Anne 
of Bohemia, an excellent princess, who was called “ the good 
Queen Anne.” She deserved a better husband; for the 
King had been fawned and flattered into a treacherous, 
wasteful, dissolute, bad young man. 

There were two Popes at this time (as if ope were not 
enough I), and their quarrels involved Europe in a great 
deal of trouble. Scotland was still troublesome too ; and 
at home there was much jealousy and distrust, and plotting 
and counter-plotting, because the King feared the ambition 
of his relations, and particularly of his uncle, the Duke of 
Lancaster, and the duke had his party against the King, 
and the King had his party against the duke. Nor were 
these home troubles lessened when the duke went to Cas- 
tile to urge his claim to the crown of that kingdom ; for 
then the Duke of Gloucester, another of Richard’s uncles, 
opposed him, and influenced the Parliament to demand the 
dismissal of the King’s favourite ministers. The King 
said in reply, that he would not for such men dismiss the 
meanest servant in his kitchen. But, it had begun to sig- 
nify little what a King said when a Parliament was deter-

mined; so Richard was at last obliged to give way, and to 
agree to another Government of the kingdom, under a 
commission of fourteen nobles, for a year. His uncle of 
Gloucester was at the head of this commission, and, in fact, 
appointed everybody composing it. 

Having done all this, the King declared as soon as he 
saw an opportunity that he had never meant to do it, and 
that it was all illegal; and he got the judges secretly to 
sign a declaration to that effect. The secret oozed out 
directly? and was carried to the Duke of Gloucester. The 
Duke of Gloucester, at the head of forty thousand men, 
met the King on his entering into London to enforce liis 
authority; the King was helpless against him ; his favour- 
ites and ministers were impeached and were mercilessly 
executed. Among them were two men whom the people 
regarded with very different feelings ; one, Robert Tresilian, 
Chief Justice, who was hated for having made what was 
called “the bloody circuit” to try the rioters; the other, 
Sir Simon Burley, an honourable knight, who had been the 
dear friend of the Black Prince, and the governor and 
guardian of the King. For this gentleman’s life the good 
Queen even begged of Gloucester on her knees ; but Glouces- 
ter (with or without reason) feared and hated him, and 
replied, that if she valued her husband’s crown, she had 
better beg no more. All this was done under what was 
called by some the wonderful — and by others, with better 
reason, the merciless — Parliament. 

But Gloucester’s power was not to last for ever. lie 
held it for only a year longer; in which year the famous 
battle of Otterbourne, sung in the old ballad of Chevy 
Chase, was fought. When the year was out, the King, 
turning suddenly to Gloucester, in the midst of a great 
council said, “ Uncle, how old am I? ” “ Your highness,” 

returned the duke, “ is in your twenty-second year.” “ Am 
I so much?” said the King, “then I will manage my own 
affairs ! I am much obliged to you, my good lords, for your 
past services, but I need them no more.” He followed 
this up, by appointing a new Chancellor and a new Treas- 
urer, aud announced to the people that he had resumed the 
Government. He held it for eight years without opposi- 
tion.. Through all that time, he kept his determination 
to revenge himself some day upon his uncle Gloucester, iu 
his own breast.

At last the good Queen died, and then the King, desir- 
ing to take a second wife, proposed to his council that he 
should marry Isabella, of France, the daughter of Charles 
the Sixth : who, the French courtiers said (as the English 
courtiers had said of Richard), was a marvel of beauty and 
wit, and quite a phenomenon — of seven years old. The 
council were divided about this marriage, but it took place. 
It secured peace between England and France for a quarter 
of a century ; but it was strongly opposed to the prejudices 
of the English people. The Duke of Gloucester, who was 
anxious to take the occasion of making himself popular, 
declaimed against it loudly, and this at length decided the 
King to execute the vengeance he had been nursing so 
long. 

He went with a gay company to the Duke of Glouces- 
ter’s house, Pleshey Castle, in Essex, where the duke, sus- 
pecting nothing, came out into the courtyard to receive his 
royal visitor. While the King conversed in a friendly 
manner with the duchess, the duke was quietly seized, 
hurried away, shipped for Calais, and lodged ih the castle 
there. His friends, the Earls of Arundel and Warwick, 
were taken in the same treacherous manner, and confined 
to their castles. A few days after, at Nottingham, they 
were impeached of high treason. The Earl of Arundel was 
condemned and beheaded, and the Earl of Warwick was 
banished. Then, a writ was sent by a messenger to the 
Governor of Calais, requiring him to send the Duke of 
Gloucester over to be tried. In three days he returned an 
answer that he could not do that, because the Duke of 
Gloucester had died in prison. The duke was declared a 
traitor, his property was confiscated to the King, a real or 
pretended confession he had made in prison to one of the 
Justices of the Common Pleas was produced against him, 
and there was an end of the matter. How the unfortunate 
duke died, very few cared to know. Whether he really 
died naturally ; whether he killed himself ; whether, by the 
King’s order, he was strangled, or smothered between two 
beds (as a serving-man of the Governor’s named Hall, did 
afterwards declare), cannot be discovered. There is not 
much doubt that he was killed, somehow or other, by his 
nephew’s orders. Among the most active nobles in these 
proceedings were the King’s cousih, Henry &olingbroke, 
whom the King had made Duke of Hereford to smooth

in the family-plotting tithes' done just such Acts themselves 
as they now condemned In the duke. They seem to have 
bd6n a corrupt Set of men ; but such men were easily found 
about the cxmrt in such days; - 1 

The people murmured at all this, and Were still very 
sore about the' French marriage. The nobles saw how little 
the King cafed for law’, and how crafty he was, and began 
to be- somewhat afraid of themselves; ; The King’s life was 
a life of continued feasting and excess; his retinue, dowh 
to the meatiest- servants, were dressed in the most costly 
manner* and caroused at his tables, it is related, to the 
number &£ tdn thousand persons every day. He himself, 
surrounded' by a body of ten thousand archers, and enriched 
by a duty On wool which the Commohs had granted 1 him for 
life, saw fid danger of Over being otherwise than powerful 
and absdlute, And was as fierce and haughty as a King 
could be. : • . . : 

He had two of his old enemies left, in the' persons of the! 
Dukesof j Hereford And Norfolk. Sparing these no mhre 
than thei bthere* hA tampered vKth the -Duke of Hereford 
until he got him' to declare before the Council that the* Duke 
of Norfolk had lately held some treasonable talk with h-imy 
as he WasAidingnear Brentford ; and that he had told him, 
among other* things* that he coiild not believe the King’s 
oath-^-which nobody could, I should think. For this 
treachery he obtained a pardon, and the Duke of* Norfolk 
was Summoned to appear and defend himself. ’As he de*> 
nied’ the charge and said his accuser was a liar and a traitor, 
both noblemen, according to' the manner of 1 those times, 
were held in Custody, and the truth* Was ordered to be de- 
cided by wager of battle at Coventry. This wager of : bat-

of Norfolk made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and after- 
wards died at Venice of a broken heart. 

Faster and fiercer, after this, the King went on in his 
career. The Duke of Lancaster, who was the father of the 
Duke of Hereford, died soon after the departure of his 
son; and, the King, although he had. solemnly granted to 
that son leave to inherit his father’s property, if it should 
come to him during his banishment, immediately seized it 
all, like a robber. The judges were so afraid of him, that 
they disgraced themselves by declaring this theft te be just 
and lawful. His avarice knew no bounds. He outlawed 
seventeen counties at once, on a frivolous pretence, merely 
to raise money by way of fines for misconduct. In short, 
he did as many dishonest things as he could; and oared so 
little for the discontent of his subjects— though even the 
spaniel favourites began to whisper to him that there was 
such a thing as discontent afloat — that he took that time, 
of all others, for leaving England and making an expedi- 
tion against the Irish. 

He was scarcely gone, leaving the Dukb of York Re- 
gent in his absence, when his cousin, Henry of Hereford, 
cam© over from France to claim the rights of which he had 
been so monstrously deprived. He was immediately joined 
by the two great Earls of Northumberland and Westmore- 
land; and his uncle, the Regent, finding the King’s cause 
unpopular, and the disinclination of the army to act against 
Henry, very strong, withdrew with the royal forces towards 
Bristol. Henry, at the head of an army, came from York- 
shire (where he had landed) to London and followed him. 
They joined their forces — how they brought that about, is 
not distinctly understood— and proceeded to Bristol Castle, 
whither three noblemen had taken the young Queen. The 
castle surrendering, they presently put those three noble- 
men to death. The Regent then remained there, and 
Henry went on to Chester. 

All this time, the boisterous weather had prevented the 
King from receiving intelligence of what had occurred. 
At length it was conveyed to him in Ireland, and he sent 
over the Earl of Salisbury, who, landing at Conway, 
rallied the Welshmen, and waited for the King a whole 
fortnight; at the end of that time the Welshmen, who were 
perhaps not very warm for him in the beginning, quite 
cooled down and went home* When the King did land

on the coast at last, he came with a pretty good power, but 
his men cared nothing for him, and quickly deserted. 
Supposing the Welshmen to be still at Conway, he disguised 
himself as a priest, and made for that place in company with 
his two brothers and some few of their adherents. But, 
there were no Welshmen left — only Salisbury and a hun- 
dred soldiers. In this distress, the King’s two brothers, 
Exeter and Surrey, offered to go to Henry to learn what 
his intentions were. Surrey, who was true to Richard, was 
put into prison. Exeter, who was false, took the royal 
badge, which was a hart, off his shield, and assumed the 
rose, the badge of Henry. After this, it liras pretty plain 
to the King what Henry’s intentions were, without send- 
ing any more messengers to ask. 

The fallen King, thus deserted — hemmed in on all sides, 
and pressed with hunger— rode here and rode there, and 
went to this castle, and went to that castle, endeavouring 
to obtain some provisions, but could find none. He rode 
wretchedly back to Conway, and there surrendered himself 
to the Earl of Northumberland, who came from Henry, in 
reality to take him prisoner, but in appearance to offer 
terms ; and whose men were hidden not far off. By this 
earl he was conducted to the castle of Flint, where his 
cousin Henry met him, and dropped on his knee as if he 
were still respectful to his sovereign. 

“Fair cousin of Lancaster,” said the King, “you are 
very welcome” (very welcome, no doubt ; but he would 
have been more so, in chains or without a head). 

u My lord,” replied Henry, “ 1 am come a little before 
my time ; but, with your good pleasure, I will show you 
the reason. Your people complain with some bitterness, 
that you have ruled them rigorously for two-and-twenty 
years. Now, if it please God, I will help you to govern 
them better in future.” ; 

“ Fair cousin,” replifed the abject King, “ since it pleas* 
eth you, it pleaseth me mightily.” 

After this, the trumpets sounded, and the King was 
stuck on a wretched horse, and carried prisoner to Chester, 
where he was made to issue a proclamation, calling a Par- 
liament. From Chester he was taken on towards London. 
At Lichfield he tried to escape by getting out of a 
window and letting himself down into a garden; it was 
all in vain, however, and he was carried on and shut up

now began to be pretty clear to the nation that Richard 
the Second would not live very long. 

It was a noisy Parliament, as it was an unprincipled one, 
and the Lords quarrelled so violently among themselves as 
to which of them had been loyal and which disloyal, and 
which consistent and which inconsistent, that forty gaunt- 
lets are said to have been thrown upon the floor at one time 
as challenges to as many battles : the truth being that they 
were all false and base together, and had been, at one 
time with the old King, and at another time with the new 
one, and seldom true for any length of time to any one. 
They soon began to plot again. A conspiracy was formed 
to invite the King to a tournament at Oxford, and then to 
take him by surprise and kill him. This murderous enter- 
prise, which was agreed upon at secret meetings in the 
house of the Abbot of Westminster, was betrayed by the 
Earl of Rutland — one of the conspirators. The King, in- 
stead of going to the tournament or staying at Windsor 
(where the conspirators suddenly went, on finding them- 
selves discovered, with the hope of seizing him), retired to 
London, proclaimed them all traitors, and advanced upou 
them with a great force. They retired into the west of 
England, proclaiming Richard King; but, the people rose 
against them, and they were all slain. Their treason hast- 
ened the death of the deposed monarch. Whether he 
was killed by hired assassins, or whether he was starved 
to death, or whether he refused food on hearing of hia 
brothers being killed (who were in that plot), is very 
doubtful. He met his death somehow; and his body was 
publicly shown at Saint Paul’s Cathedral with only the 
lower part of the face uncovered. I can scarcely doubt 
that he was killed by the King’s orders, 

The French wife of the miserable Richard was now only 
ten years old ; and, when her father, Charles of France, 
heard of her misfortunes and of her lonely condition in 
England, he went mad: as he had several timesMane be- 
fore, during the last five or six years. The FrenQt Dubes 
of Burgundy and Bourbon took up the poor girl’s cause, 
without earing much about it, but on the chance of getting 
something out of England. The people of Bordeaux, who 
had a sort of superstitious attachment to the memory of 
Richard, because he was bom there, sworn by the Lord that

going rather far — and promised to do great things against 
the English. Nevertheless, when they came to consider 
that they, and the whole people of France, were rained by 
their own nobles, and that the English rule was much the 
better of the two, they cooled down again; and the two 
dukes, although they were very great men, could do noth- 
ing without them. Then, began negotiations between 
France and England for the sending home to Paris of the 
poor little Queen with all her jewels and her fortune of two 
hundred thousand francs in gold. The King was quite 
willing to restore the young lady, and even the jewels ; but 
he said he really oould not part with the money. So, at 
last she was safely deposited at Paris without her fortune, 
and then the Duke of Burgundy (who was cousin to the 
French King) began to quarrel with the Duke of Orleans 
(who was brother to the French King) about the whole 
matter; and those two dukes made France even more 
wretched than ever. 

As the idea of conquering Scotland was still popular at 
home, the King marched to the river Tyne and demanded 
homage of the King of that country. This being refused, 
he advanced to Edinburgh, but did little there; for, his 
army being in want of provisions, and the Scotch being 
very careful to hold him in check without giving battle, he 
was obliged to retire. It is to his immortal honour that in 
this sally he burnt no villages and slaughtered no people, 
but was particularly careful that his army should be merciful 
and harmless. It was a great example in those ruthless times. 

A war among the border people of England and Scot- 
land went on for twelve months, and then the Earl of 
Northumberland, the nobleman who had helped Henry to 
the crown, began to rebel against him — probably because 
nothing that Henry could do for him would satisfy his 
extravagant expectations. There was a certain Welsh gen- 
tleman, named Owbn Glenbowbr, who had been a stu- 
dent in. one of the Inns of Court, and had afterwards been 
in the service of the late King, whose Welsh property was 
taken from him by a powerful lord related to the present 
King, who was his neighbour. Appealing for redress, and 
getting none, he took up arms, was made an outlaw, and 
declared himself sovereign of Wales. He pretended to be 
a magician ; and not only were the Welsh people stupid 
enough to hefi&tfe him, but, oven Henry believed him too;

for, making three expeditions Into Wales, and bding three

worst. The young Earl of March and his brother were 
stolen out of Windsor Castle. Being retaken, and being 
found to have been spirited away by one Lady Spencer, 
she accused her own brother, that Earl of Rutland who 
was in the former conspiracy and was now Duke of York, 
of being in the plot. For this he was rained in fortune, 
though not put to death; and then another plot arose 
among the old Earl of Northumberland* some other lords, 
and that same Scroop, Archbishop of York, who was with 
the rebels before. These conspirators caused a writing to 
be posted on the church doors, accusing the King of a va- 
riety of crimes; but, the King being eager and vigilant to 
oppose them, they were all taken, and the Archbishop was 
executed. This was the first time that a great churchman 
had been slain by the law in England; but the King was 
resolved that it should be done, and done it was. 

The next most remarkable event of this time was the 
seizure, by Henry, of the heir to the Scottish throne — 
James, a boy of nine years old. He had been put aboard- 
8hip by his father, the Scottish King Robert, to save him 
from the designs of his uncle, when, on his way to France, 
he was accidentally taken by some English cruisers. He 
remained a prisoner in England for nineteen years, and be- 
came in his prison a student and a fgttnbps poet. 

With the exception of occasional troubles with the Welsh 
and with the French, the rest of the King Henry's reign 
was quiet enough. But, the King was far from happy, and 
probably was troubled in his conscience by knowing that 
he had usurped the crown, and had occasioned the death of 
his miserable cousin. The Prince of Wales, though brave 
and generous, is said to have been mid and dissipated, and 
even to have drawn his sword on Gascoigne, the Chief Jus- 
tice of the King's Bench, because he was firm in dealing 
impartially with one of his dissolute companions. Upon 
this the Chief Justice is said to have ordered him iinmedi- 
ately to prison; the Prince of Wales is said to have sub- 
mitted with U good grace; and ifoe King is Said to have ex- 
claimed, " Happy is the monarch who has so just a judge, 
and a son So willing to obey the laws.” This is all very 
doubtful, and so is another story (of which Shakespeare 
has made beautiful use), that the Prince once took the 
crown oat of his father's chamber as he was sleeping, and

A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


The King’s health sank more and more, and he became 
subject to violent eruptions on the face and to bad epileptic i 
fits, and his spirits sank every day. At last, as he was 
praying before the shrine of Saint Edward at Westminster 
Abbey, he was seized with a terrible fit, and was carried 
into the Abbot’s Chamber, where he presently died. It 
had been foretold that he would die at Jerusalem, which , 

certainly is not, and never was, Westminster. But, as the j 

Abbot’s room had long been called the Jerusalem chamber, j 
people said it was all the same thing, and were quite satis- 
fied with the prediction. I 

The King died on the 20th of March, 1413, in the forty- 
seventh year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign. j 
He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral. He had been 
twice married, and had, by his first wife, a family of four i 
sons and two daughters. Considering his duplicity before ' 
he came to the throne, his unjust seizure of it, and above 
all, his making that monstrous law for the burning of 
what the priests called heretics, he was a reasonably good 
king, as kings went. 


CHAPTER XXI. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIFTH. 

FIRST PART. 

The Prince of Wales began his reign like a generous and 
honest man. He set the young Earl of March free ; he re- 
stored their estates and their honours to the Percy family, 
who had lost them by their rebellion against his father ; he 
ordered the imbecile and unfortunate Richard to be hon- 
ourably buried among the Kings of England; and he dis- 
missed all his wild companions, with assurances that they 
should not want, if they would resolve to be steady, faith- 
ful, and true. 

It is much easier to burn men than to bum their opin- 
ions ; and those of the Lollards were spreading every day. 
The Lollards were represented by the priests — probably 
falsely for the most part — to entertain treasonable designs 
against the new King ; and Henry, suffering himself to be

worked upon by these representations, sacrificed his friend 
Sir John Oldoastle, the Lord Cobham, to them, after try- 
iug in vain to convert him by arguments. He was declared 
guilty, as the head of the sect, and sentenced to the 
dames; but he escaped from the Tower before the day of 
execution (postponed for fifty days by the King himself), 
and summoned the Lollards to meet him near London on a 
certain day. So the priests told the King, at least. I 
doubt whether there was any conspiracy beyond such as 
was got up by their agents. On the day appointed, in- 
stead of five-and-twenty thousand men, under the command 
of Sir John Oldcastle, in the meadows of Saint Giles, the 
King found only eighty men, and no Sir John at all. 
There was, in another place, an addle-headed brewer, who 
had gold trappings to his horses, and a pair of gilt spurs 
in his breast — expecting to be made a knight next day by 
Sir John, and so to gain the right to wear them — but there 
was no Sir John, nor did anybody give information respect- 
ing him, though the King offered great rewards for such 
intelligence. Thirty of these unfortunate Lollards were 
hanged and drawn immediately, and were then burnt, gal- 
lows and all ; and the various prisons in and around Lon- 
don were crammed full of others. Some of these unfortu- 
nate men made various confessions of treasonable designs ; 
but, such confessions were easily got, under torture and the 
fear of fire, and are very little to be trusted. To finish the 
sad story of Sir John Oldcastle at once, I may mention 
that he escaped into Wales, and remained there safely, for 
four years. When discovered by Lord Powis, it is very 
doubtful if he would have been taken alive — so great was 
the old soldier’s bravery — if a miserable old woman had 
not come behind him and broken his legs with a stool. He 
was carried to London in a horse-litter, was fastened by 
an iron chain to a gibbet, and so roasted to death. 

To make the state of France as plain as I can in a few 
words, I should tell you that the Duke of Orleans, and the 
Duke of Burgundy, commonly called “ John without fear,” 
had had a grand reconciliation of their quarrel in the last 
reign, and had appeared to be quite in a heavenly state of 
mind. Immediately after which, on a Sunday, in the 
public streets of Paris, the Duke of Orleans was murdered by 
a party of twenty men, set on by the Duke of Burgundy — 
according to his own deliberate confession. The widow of

A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

King Richard had been married in France to the eldest son 
of the Duke of Orleans. The poor mad King was quite 
powerless to help her, and the Duke of Burgundy became 
the real master of France. Isabella dying, her husband 
(Duke of Orleans since the death of his father) married 1 
the daughter of the Count of Armagnac, who, being a much | 
abler man than his young son-in-law, headed his party; | 
thence called after him Armagnacs. Thus, France was 
now in this terrible condition, that it had in it the party 
of the King’s son, the Dauphin Louis; the party of the 
Duke of Burgundy, who was the father of the Dauphin’s 
ill-used wife ; and the party of the Armagnacs ; all hating 
each other; all fighting together; all composed of the most 
depraved nobles that the earth has ever known ; and all ; 
tearing unhappy France to pieces. 

The late King had watched these dissensions from Eng- 
land, sensible (like the French people) that no enemy of 
France could injure her more than her own nobility. The 
present King now advanced a claim to the French throne. 

His demand being, of course, refused, he reduced his pro- 
posal to a cert&in large amount of French territory, and to 
demanding the French princess, Catherine, in marriage, 
with a fortune of two millions of golden crowns. He was 
offered less territory and fewer crowns, and no princess; 
but he called his ambassadors home and prepared for war. 
Then, he proposed to take the princess with one million 
of crowns. The French Court replied that he should have 
the princess with two hundred thousand crowns less; he 
said this would not do (he had never seen the princess in 
his life), and assembled his army at Southampton. There 
was a short plot at home just at that time, for deposing 
him, and making the Earl of March King£ but the conspir- 
ators were all speedily condemned and executed, and the 
King embarked for France. 

It is dreadful to observe how long a bad example will be 
followed ; but, it is encouraging to know that a good ex- 
ample is never thrown away. The King’s first act oil dis- 
embarking at the mouth of the river Seine, three miles 
from Harfleur, was to imitate his father, and to proclaim 
his solemn orders that the lives and property of the i>eaee- 
able inhabitants should be respected on pain of death . It 
is agreed by French writers, to his lasting renown, that 
even while his soldiers were suffering the greatest di$'

tress from want of food, these commands were rigidly 
obeyed. 

With an army in all of thirty thousand men, he besieged 
the town of Harfleur both by sea and land for five weeks ; 
at the end of which time the town surrendered, and the in- 
habitants were allowed to depart with only fivepence each, 
and a part of their clothes. All the rest of their posses- 
sions was divided amongst the English army. But, that 
army suffered so much, in spite of its successes, from dis- 
ease and privation, that it was already reduced one-half. 
Still, the King was determined not to retire until he had 
struck a greater blow. Therefore, against the advice of all 
his counsellors, he moved on with his little force towards 
Calais. When he came up to the river Somme he was un- 
able to cross, in consequence of the fort being fortified ; 
and, as the English moved up the left bank of the river 
looking for a crossing, the French, who had broken all the 
bridges, moved up. the right bank, watching them, and wait- 
ing to attack them when they should try to pass it. At 
last the English found a crossing and got safely over. 
The French held a council of war at Rouen, resolved to 
give the English battle, and sent heralds to King Henry to 
know by which road he was going. “ By the road that will 
take me straight to Calais! v said the King, and sent them 
away with a present of a hundred cr owns. 

The English moved on, until they beheld the French, 
and then the King gave orders to form in line of battle. 
The French not coming on, the army broke up after re- 
maining in battle array till night, and got good rest and 
refreshment at a neighbouring village. The French were 
now all lying in another village, through which they knew 
the English must pass. They were resolved that the Eng- 
lish should begin the battle. The English had no means 
of retreat, if their King had any such intention ; and so the 
two armies passed the night, close together. 

To understand these armies well, you must bear in mind 
that the immense French army had, among its notable per- 
sons, almost the whole of that wicked nobility, whose de- 
bauchery had made France a desert; and so besotted were 
they by pride, and by contempt for the common people, 
that they had scarcely any bowmen (if indeed they had 
any at all) in their whole enormous number : which, com- 
pared with the English army, was at least as six to one.

For these proud fools had said that the bow was not a fit j 

weapon for knightly hands, and that France must be de- I 

fended by gentlemen only. We shall see, presently, what 1 

hand the gentlemen made of it. * 

Now, on the English side, among the little force, there j 

was a good proportion of men who were not gentlemen by 1 

any means, but who were good stout archers for all that. , 

Among them, in the morning — having slept little at night, 
while the French were carousing and making sure of vie- ! 

tory — the King rode, on a grey horse ; wearing on his : 

head a helmet of shining steel, surmounted by a crown of 
gold, sparkling with precious stones ; and bearing over his 
armour, embroidered together, the arms of England and ! 
the arms of France. The archers looked at the shining 
helmet and the crown of gold and the sparkling jewels, and 
admired them all ; but, what they admired most was the ■ 
King’s cheerful face, and his bright blue eye, as he told 
them that, for himself, he had made up his mind to con- 
quer there or to die there, and that England should never 
have a ransom to pay for him. There was one brave knight 
who chanced to say that he wished some of the many gal- 
lant gentlemen and good soldiers, who were then idle at 
home in England, were there to increase their numbers. 

But the King told him that, for his part, he did not wish 
for one more man. “The fewer we have,” said he, “the 
greater will be the honour we shall win ! ” His men, being 
now all in good heart, were refreshed with bread and wine, 
and heard prayers, and waited quietly for the French, 
the King waited for the French, because they were drawn 
up thirty deep (the little English force was only three 
deep), on very difficult and heavy ground; and he knew 
that when they moved, there must be confusion among 
them. 

As they did not move, he sent off two parties : — one to lie 
concealed in a wood on the left of the French : the other, 
to set fire to some houses behind the French after the bat- 
tle should be begun. This was scarcely done, when three 
of the proud French gentlemen, who were to defend their 
country without any help from the base peasants, came 
riding out, calling upon the English to surrender. The 
King warned those gentlemen himself to retire with all 
speed if they cared for their lives, and ordered the English 
banners to advance. Upon that, Sir Thomas Erpingham ;

a great English general, who commanded the archers, threw 
his truncheon into the air, joyfully ; and all the English 
men, kneeling down upon the ground and biting it as if 
they took possession of the country, rose up with a great 
shout and fell upon the French. 

Every archer was furnished with a great stake tipped 
with iron $ and his orders were, to thrust this stake into 
the ground, to discharge his arrow, and then to fall back, 
when the French horsemen came bn. As the haughty 
French gentlemen, who were to break the English archers 
and utterly destroy them with their knightly lances, camo 
riding up, they were received with such a blinding storm 
of arrows, that they broke and turned. Horses and men 
rolled over one another, and the confusion was terrific. 
Those who rallied and charged the archers got among the 
stakes on slippery and boggy ground, and were so bewil- 
dered that the English archers — who wore no armour, and 
even took off their leathern coats to be more active — cut 
them to pieces, root and branch. Only three French horse- 
men got within the stakes, and those were instantly de- 
spatched. All this time the dense French army, being in 
armour, were sinking knee-deep into the mire ; while the 
light English archers, half-naked, were as fresh and active 
as if they were fighting on a marble floor. 

But now, the second division of the French coming to 
the relief of the first, closed up in a firm mass ; the Eng- 
lish, headed by the King, attacked them ; and the deadli- 
est part of the battle began. The King’ s brother, the Duke 
of Clarence, was struck down, and numbers of the French 
surrounded him ; but, King Henry , standing over the body, 
fought like a lion until they were beaten off. 

Presently, came up a band of eighteen French knights, 
bearing the banner of a certain French lord, who had 
sworn to kill or take the English King. One of them 
struck him such a blow with a battle-axe that he reeled 
and fell. upon his knees; but, his faithful men, imme- 
diately closing round him, killed every one of those 
eighteen knights, and so that French lord never kept his 
oath. 

The French Duke of Alenqon, seeing this, made a des- 
perate charge, and cut his way close up to the Royal 
Standard of England. He beat down the Duke of York, 
who was standing near it ; and, when the King came to his

rescue, struck off a piece of the crown he wore. But, he 
never struck another blow in this world ; for, even as he 
was in the act of saying who he was, and that he surren- 
dered to the King ; and even as the King stretched out his 
hand to give him a safe and honourable acceptance of the 
offer ; he fell dead, pierced by innumerable wounds. 

The death of this nobleman decided the battle. The 
third division of the French army, which had never struck 
a blow yet, and which was, in itself, more than double 
the whole English power, broke and fled. At this time of 
the fight, the English, who as yet had made no prisoners, 
began, to take them in immense numbers, and were still oc- 
cupied in doing so, or in killing those who would not sur- 
render, when a great noise arose in the rear of the French 
— their flying banners were seen to stop — and King Henry, 
supposing a great reinforcement to have arrived, gave or- 
ders that all the prisoners should be put to death. As 
soon, however, as it was found that the noise was only 
occasioned by a body of plundering peasants, the terrible 
massacre was stopped. 

Then King Henry called to him the French herald, and 
asked him to whom the victory belonged. 

The herald replied, “To the King of England.” 

“ We have not made this havoc and slaughter,” said the 
King. “ It is the wrath of Heaven on the sins of France. 
What is the name of that castle yonder? ” 

The herald answered him, “ My lord, it is the castle of 
Azineourt.” 

Said the King, “From henceforth this battle shall be 
known to posterity, by the name of the battle of Azin- 
court.” 

Our English historians have made it Agincourt; but, 
under that name, it will ever be famous in English annals. 

The loss upon the French side was enormous. Three 
dukes were killed, two more were taken prisoners, seven 
counts were killed, three more were taken prisoners, and 
ten thousand knights and gentlemen were slain upon the 
field. The English loss amounted to sixteen hundred men, 
among whom were the Duke of York and the Earl of 
Suffolk.. 

War is a dreadful thing; and it is appalling to know 
how the English were obliged, next morning, to kill those 
prisoners mortally wounded, who yet writhed in agony

upon the ground ; how the dead upon the French side were 
stripped by their own countrymen and countrywomen, and 
afterwards buried in great pits ; how the dead upon the 
English side were piled up in a great barn, and how their 
bodies and the barn were all burned together. It is in 
such things, and in many more much too horrible to* relate; 
that the real desolation and wickedness 6f war consist. 
Nothing can make war otherwise than horrible. But the 
dark side of it was little thought of and soon forgotten ; 
and it cast no shade of trouble on the English people, ex- 
cept on those who had lost friends or relations in the fight. 
They welcomed their King home with shouts of rejoicing, 
and plunged into the water to bear him ashore on their 
shoulders, and flocked out in crowds to welcome him in 
every town through which he passed, and hung rich car- 
pets and tapestries out of the windows, and strewed the 
streets with flowers, and made the fountains run with Wine, 
as the great field of Agineourt had run with blood. 

SECOND PART. 

That proud and wicked French nobility who dragged 
their country to destruction, and who were every day and 
every year regarded with deeper hatred and detestation in 
the hearts of the French people, learnt nothing, even from 
the defeat of Agineourt. So far from uniting against the 
common enemy, they became, among themselves, more 
violent, more bloody, and more false — if that were possi- 
ble — than they had been before. The Count of Armagnac 
persuaded the Flench King to plunder of her treasures 
Queen Isabella of Bavaria, and to make her a prisoner. 
She, who had hitherto been the bitter enemy of the Duke 
of Burgundy, proposed to join him, in revenge. He car- 
ried her off to Troyes, where she proclaimed herself Regent 
of France, and made him her lieutenant. The Armagnac 
party were at that time possessed of Paris ; but, one of the 
gates of the city being secretly opened on a certain night 
to a party of the duke’s men, they got into Paris, threw 
into the prisons all the Armagnaes upon whom they could 
lay their hands, and, a few nights afterwards, with the aid 
of a furious mob of sixty thousand people, broke the pris- 
ons open, and killed them all. The former Dauphin was 
now dead, and the King’s third son bore the title. Him,

in the height of this murderous scene, a French knight 
hurried out of bed, wrapped in a sheet, and bore away to 
Poitiers. So, when the revengeful Isabella and the Duke 
of Burgundy entered Paris in triumph after the slaughter 
of their enemies, the Dauphin was proclaimed at Poitiers 
as the real Begent. 

King Henry had not been idle since his victory of Agin- 
court, but had repulsed a brave attempt of the French to 
recover Harfleur ; had gradually conquered a great part of 
Normandy ; and, at this crisis of affairs, took the impor- 
tant town of Bouen, after a siege of half a year. This 
great loss so alarmed the French, that the Duke of Bur- 
gundy proposed that a meeting to treat of peace should 
be held between the French and the English kings in a 
plain by the river Seine. On the appointed day, King 
Henry appeared there, with his two brothers, Clarence and 
Gloucester, and a thousand men. The unfortunate French 
King, being more mad than usual that day, could not 
come; but the Queen came, and with her the Princess 
Catherine : who was a very lovely creature, and who made 
a real impression on King Henry, now that he saw her for 
the first time. This was the most important circumstance 
that arose out of the meeting. 

As if it were impossible for a French nobleman of that 
time to be true to his word of honour in anything, Henry 
discovered that the Duke of Burgundy was, at that very 
moment, in secret treaty with the Dauphin ; and he there- 
fore abandoned the negotiation. 

The Duke of Burgundy and the Dauphin, each of whom 
with the best reason distrusted the other as a noble ruffian 
surrounded by a party of noble ruffians, were rather at a 
loss how to proceed after this ; but, at length they agreed 
to meet, on a bridge over the river Yonne, where it was 
arranged that there should be two strong gates put up, 
with an empty space between them ; and that the Duke of 
Burgundy should come into that space by one gate, with 
ten men only ; and that the Dauphin should come into that 
space by the other gate, also with ten men, and no more. 

So far the Dauphin kept his word, but no farther. When 
the Duke of Burgundy was on his knee before him in the 
act of speaking, one of the Dauphins noble ruffians cut 
the said duke down with a small axe, and others speedily 
finished him.

It was in vain for the Danphin to pretend that this base 
murder was not done with his consent; it was too bad, even 
for France, and caused a general horror. The duke’s heir 
hastened to make a treaty with King Henry, and the 
French Queen engaged that her husband should consent to 
it, whatever it was. Henry made peace, on condition of 
receiving the Princess Catherine in marriage, and being 
made Regent of France during the rest of the King’s life- 
time, and succeeding to the French crown at his death. 
He was soon married to the beautiful Princess, and took 
her proudly home to England, where she was crowned with 
great honour and glory. 

This peace was called the Perpetual Peace ; we shall soon 
see how long it lasted. It gave great satisfaction to the 
French people, although they were so poor and miserable, 
that, at the time of the celebration of the Royal marriage, 
numbers of them were dying with starvation, on the dung- 
hills in the streets of Paris. There was some resistance on 
the part of the Dauphin in some few parts of France, but 
King Henry beat it all down. 

And now, with his great possessions in France secured, 
and his beautiful wife to cheer him, and a son born to give 
him greater happiness, all appeared bright before him. 
But, in the fulness of his triumph and the height of his 
power, Death came upon him, and his day was done. 
When he fell ill at Vincennes, and found that he could not 
recover, he was very calm and quiet, and spoke serenely 
to those/ who wept around his bed. His wife and child, he 
said, he left to the loving care of his brother the Duke of 
Bedford, and his other faithful nobles. He gave them ad- 
vice that England should establish a friendship with the 
new Duke of Burgundy, and offer him the Regency of 
France ; that it should not set free the royal princes who 
had been taken at Agincourt ; and that, whatever quarrel 
might arise with France, England should never make 
peace without holding Normandy. Then, he laid down 
his head, and asked the attendant priests to chant the pen- 
itential psalms. Amid which solemn sounds, on the thirty- 
first of August, one thousand four hundred and twenty- 
two, in only the thirty-fourth year of his age and the tenth 
of his reign, King Henry the Fifth passed away. 

Slowly and mournfully they carried his embalmed body 
in a procession of great state to Paris, and thence to Rouen

where his Queen was : from whom the sad intelligence of 
his death was concealed until he had been dead some days. 
Thence, lying on a bed of crimson and gold, with a golden 
crown upon the head, and a golden ball and sceptre lying 
in the nerveless hands, they carried it to Calais, with such 
a great retinue as seemed to dye the road black. The King 
of Scotland acted as chief mourner, all the Royal House- 
hold followed, the knights wore black armour and black 
plumes of feathers, crowds of men bore torches, making 
the night as light as day ; and the widowed Princess fol- 
lowed last of all. At Calais there was a fleet of ships to 
bring the funeral host to Dover. And so, by way of Lon- 
don Bridge, where the service for the dead was chanted as 
it passed along, they brought the body to Westminster 
Abbey, and there buried it with great respect. 


CHAPTER XXII. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SIXTH. 

PART THE FIRST* 

It had been the wish of the late King, that while his 
infant son King Henry the Sixth, at this time only nine 
months old, was under age, the Duke of Gloucester should 
be appointed Regent. The English Parliament, however, 
preferred to appoint a Council of Regency, with the Duke 
of Bedford at its head: to be represented, in his absence 
Only, by the Duke of Gloucester. The Parliament would 
seem to have been wise in this, for Gloucester soon showed 
himself to be ambitious and troublesome, and, in the grati- 
fication of his own personal schemes, gave dangerous offence 
to the Duke of Burgundy, which was with difficulty ad- 
justed. 

As that duke declined the Regency of France, it was be- 
stowed by the poor French King upon the Duke of Bedford. 
But, the French King dying within two months, the 
Dauphin iustantly asserted his claim to the French throne, 
and was actually crowned under the title of Charles the 
Seventh. The Duke of Bedford, to be a .match for him*

entered into a friendly league with the Dukes of Burgundy 
and Brittany, and gave them his two sisters in marriage. 
War with France was immediately renewed, and the Per- 
petual Peace came to an untimely end. 

In the first campaign, the English, aided by this alli- 
ance, were speedily successful. As Scotland, however, 
had sent the French five thousand men, and might send 
more, or attack the North of England while England was 
busy with France, it was considered that it would be a 1 good 
thing to offer the Scottish King, James, who had bein so 
long imprisoned, his liberty, on his paying forty thousand 
pounds for his board and lodging during nineteen years, 
and engaging to forbid his subjects from serving under the 
flag of France. It is pleasant to know, not only that the 
amiable captive at last regained his freedom upon these 
terms, but, that he married a noble English lady, with 
whom he had been long in love, and became an excellent 
King. I am afraid we have met with some Kings in this 
history, and shall meet with some more, who would have 
been very much the better, and would have left the world 
much happier, if they had been imprisoned nineteen years 
too. 

In the second campaign, the English gained a consider- 
able victory at Verneuil, in a battle which was chiefly re- 
markable, otherwise, for their resorting to the odd expedi- 
ent of tying their baggage-horses together by the heads and 
tails, and jumbling them up with the baggage, so as to 
convert them into a sort of live fortification — whioh was 
found useful to the troops, but which I should think was 
not agreeable to the horses. For three years afterwards 
very little was done, owing to both sides being too poor for 
war, which is a very expensive entertainment 5 but, a coun- 
cil was then held in Paris, in which it was decided' to lay 
siege to the town of Orleans, which was a place of great 
importance to the Dauphin’s cause. An English army of 
ten thousand men was despatched on this service, under 
the command of the Earl of Salisbury, a general of fame. 
He being unfortunately killed early in the siege, the Earl 
of Suffolk took his place; under whom (reinforced by Sir 
John Falstaff, who brought up four hundred wagons 
laden with salt herrings and other provisions for the troops, 
and, beating off the French who tried to intercept him, 
came victorious out of a hot skirmish,* which was •' after

wards called in jest the Battle of the Herrings), the town 
of Orleans was so completely hemmed in, that the be- 
sieged proposed to yield it up to their countryman the 
Duke of Burgundy. The English general, however, replied 
that his English men had won it, so far, by their blood and 
valour, and that his English men must have it. There 
seemed to be no hope for the town, or for the Dauphin, who 
was so dismayed that he even thought of flying to Scotland 
or to Spain — when a peasant girl rose up and changed the 
whole state of affairs. 

The story of this peasant girl I have now to tell. 

PART THE SECOND. 

The Story of Joan of Arc. 

In a remote village among some wild hills in the prov- 
ince of Lorraine, there lived a countryman whose name was 
Jacques d’Arc. He had a daughter, Joan of Arc, who 
was at this time in her twentieth year. She had been a 
solitary girl from her childhood; she had often tended 
sheep and cattle for whole days where no human figure 
was seen or human voice heard ; and she had often knelt, 
for hours together, in the gloomy empty little village chapel, 
looking up at the altar and at the dim lamp burning before 
it, until she fancied that she saw shadowy figures standing 
there, and even that she heard them speak to her. The 
people in that part of France were very ignorant and su- 
perstitious, and they had many ghostly tales to tell about 
what they had dreamed, and what they saw among the 
lonely hills when the clouds and the mists were resting on 
them. So, they easily believed that Joan saw strange 
sights, and they whispered among themselves that angels 
and spirits talked to her. 

At last, Joan told her father that she had one day been 
surprised by a great unearthly light, and had afterwards 
heard a solemn voice, which said it was Saint Michael’s 
voice, telling her that she was to go and help the Dauphin. 
Soon after this (she said), Saint Catherine and Saint Mar- 
garet had appeared to her with sparkling crowns upon their 
heads, and had encouraged her to be virtuous and resolute. 
These visions had returned sometimes; but the Voices very 
often; and the Voices always said, “ Joan, thou art ap-

pointed by Heaven to go and help the Dauphin ! ” She 
almost always heard them while the chapel bells were 
ringing. 

There is no doubt, now, that Joan believed she saw and 
heard these things. It is very well known that such delu- 
sions are a disease which is not by any means uncommon. 
It is probable enough that there were figures of Saint 
Michael, and Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, in the 
little chapel (where they would be very likely to have shin- 
ing crowns upon their heads), and that they first gave Joan 
the idea of those three personages. She had long been a 
moping, fanciful girl, and, though she was a very good girl, 
I dare say she was a little vain, and wishful for notoriety. 

Her father, something wiser than his neighbours, said, 
“ I tell thee, Joan, it is thy fancy. Thou hadst better 
have a kind husband to take care of thee, girl, and work to 
employ thy mind ! ” But J oan told him in reply, that she 
had taken a vow never to have a husband, and that she 
must go as Heaven directed her, to help the Dauphin. 

It happened, unfortunately for her father’s persuasions, 
and most unfortunately for the poor girl, too, that a party 
of the Dauphin’ 8 enemies found their way into the village 
while Joan’s disorder was at this point, and burnt the 
chapel, and drove out the inhabitants. The cruelties she 
saw committed, touched Joan’s heart and made her worse. 
She said that the Voices and the figures were now continu- 
ally with her ; that they told her she was the girl who, 
according to an old prophecy, was to deliver France ; and 
she must go and help the Dauphin, and must remain with 
him until he should be crowned at Rheims : and that she 
must travel a long way to a certain lord named Baudri- 
court, who could and would bring her into the Dauphin’s 
presence. 

As her father still said, “I tell thee, Joan, it is thy 
fancy,” she set off to find out this lord, accompanied by an 
uncle, a poor village wheelwright and cart-maker, who be- 
lieved in the reality of her visions. They travelled a long 
way and went on and on, over a rough country, full of the 
Duke of Burgundy’s men, and of all kinds of robbers and 
marauders, until they came to where this lord was. 

When his servants told him that there was a poor peas- 
ant girl named Joan of Arc, accompanied by nobody but an 
old village wheelwright and cart-maker, who wished to see

him because she was commanded to help the Dauphin and 
save France, Baudricourt burst out a laughing, and bade 
them send the girl away. But, he soon heard so much 
about her lingering in the town, and praying in the churches, 
and seeing visions, and doing harm to no one, that he sent 
for her, and questioned her. As she said the same things 
after she had been well sprinkled with holy water as she 
had said before the sprinkling, Baudricourt began to think 
there might be something in it. At all events, he thought 
it worth while to send her on to the town of Cliinon, where 
the Dauphin was. So, he bought her a horse, and a sword, 
and gave her two squires to conduct her. As the Voices 
had told Joan that she was to wear a man’s dress, now, 
she put one on, and girded her sword to her side, and bound 
spurs to her heels, and mounted her horse and rode away 
Tvith her two squires. As to her uncle the wheelwright, 
he stood staring at his niece in wonder until she was out of 
sight — as well he might — and then went home again. 
The best place, too. 

Joan and her two squires rode on and on, until they 
came to Chinon, where she was, after some doubt, ad- 
mitted into the Dauphin’s presence. Picking him out im- 
mediately from all his court, she told him that she came 
commanded by Heaven to subdue his enemies and conduct 
him to his coronation at Bheiins. She also told him (or 
he pretended so afterwards, to make the greater impression 
upon his soldiers) a number of his secrets known only to 
himself, and, furthermore, she said there was an old, old 
sword in the cathedral of Saint Catherine at Fierbois, 
marked with five old crosses on the blade, which Saint 
Catherine had ordered her to wear. 

Now, nobody knew anything about this old, old sword, 
but when the cathedral came to be examined — which was 
immediately done — there, sure enough, the sword was 
found! The Dauphin then required a number of grave 
priests and bishops to give him their opinion whether the 
girl derived her power from good spirits or from evil spir- 
its, which they held prodigiously long debates about, in the 
course of which several learned men fell fast asleep and 
snored loudly. At last, when one gruff old gentleman had 
said, to Joan, “ What language do your Voices speak? * 
and when Joan had replied to the gruff old gentleman, “ A 
pleasanter language than yours,” they agreed that it waa

all correct, and that Joan of Arc was inspired from Heavf 
en. This wonderful circumstance put new heart into the 
Dauphin’s soldiers when they heard of it, and dispirited 
the English army, who took Joan for a witch. 

So Joan mounted horse again, and again rode on and on, 
until she came to Orleans. But she rode how, as never 
peasant girl had ridden yet. She rode upon a white war- 
horse, in a suit of glittering armour; with the old, old 
sword from the cathedral, newly burnished, in her belt; 
with a white flag carried before her, upon which were a 
picture of God, and the words Jesus Maria. In this 
splendid state, at the head of a great body of troops escort- 
ing provisions of all kinds for the starving inhabitants of 
Orleans, she appeared before that beleaguered city. 

When the people on the walls beheld her, they cried out 
“ The Maid is come ! The Maid of the Prophecy is come 
to deliver us! ” And this, and the sight Qf the Maid fight* 
ing at the head of their men, made the French so bold, 
and made the English so fearful, that the English line of 
forts was soon broken, the troops and provisions were got 
into the town, and Orleans was saved. 

Joan, henceforth called The Maib op Orleans, re* 
mained within the walls for a few days, and caused letters 
to be thrown over, ordering Lord Suffolk and his English^ 
men to depart from before the town according to the will 
of Heaven. As the English general very positively declined 
to believe that Joan knew anything about the will* of 
Heaven (which did not mend the matter with his soldiers, 
for they stupidly said if she were not inspired she was a 
witch, and it was of no use to fight against a witch), she 
mounted her white war-horse again, and ordered her white 
banner to advance. 

The besiegers held the bridge, and some Strong towers 
upon the bridge ; and here the Maid of Orleans attacked 
them. The fight was fourteen hours long. She planted a 
scaling ladder with her own hands, and mounted a to“wer 
wall, but was struck by an English arrow in the neck, and 
fell into the trench. She was carried away and the arrow 
was taken out, during which operation she screamed and 
cried with the pain, as any other girl might have done $ 
but presently she said that the Voices were speaking to her 
and soothing her to rest. After a while, she got up, and 
was again foremost in the fight. When the English who

had seen her fall and supposed her dead, saw this, they 
were troubled with the strangest fears, and some of them 
cried out that they beheld Saint Michael on a white horse 
(probably Joan herself) fighting for the French. They 
lost the bridge, and lost the towers, and next day set their 
chain of forts on fire, and left the place. 

But as Lord Suffolk himself retired no farther than the 
town of Jargeau, which was only a few miles off, the Maid 
of Orleans besieged him there, and he was taken prisoner. 
As the white banner scaled the wall, she was struck upon 
the head with a stone, and was again tumbled down into 
the ditch ; but, she only cried all the more, as she lay 
there, “On, on, my countrymen! And fear nothing, for 
the Lord hath delivered them into our hands ! ” After this 
new success of the Maid’s, several other fortresses and 
places which had previously held out against the Dauphin 
were delivered up without a battle ; and at Patay she de- 
feated the remainder of the English army, and set up her 
victorious white banner on a field where twelve hundred 
Englishmen lay dead. 

She now urged the Dauphin (who always kept out of the 
way when there was any fighting) to proceed to Rheims, 
as the first part of her mission was accomplished ; and to 
complete the whole by being crowned there. The Dauphin 
was in no particular hurry to do this, as Rheims was a long 
way off, and the English and the Duke of Burgundy were 
still strong in the country through which the road lay. 
However, they set forth, with ten thousand men, and again 
the Maid of Orleans rode on and on, upon her white war- 
horse, and in her shining armour. Whenever they came 
to a town which yielded readily, the soldiers believed in 
her ; but, whenever they came to a town which gave them 
any trouble, they began to murmur that she was an impos- 
tor. The latter was particularly the case at Troyes, which 
finally yielded, however, through the persuasion of one 
Richard, a friar of the place. Friar Richard was in the 
old doubt about the Maid of Orleans, until he had sprinkled 
her well with holy water, and had also well sprinkled the 
threshold of the gate by which she came into the city. 
Finding that it made no change in her or the gate, he said, 
as the other grave old gentlemen had said, that it was all 
right, and became her great ally. 

So, at last, by dint of riding on and on, the Maid of

Orleans, and the Dauphin, and the ten thousand sometimes 
believing and sometimes unbelieving men, came to Rheims. 
And in the great cathedral of Rheims, the Dauphin actually 
was crowned Charles the Seventh in a great assembly of 
the people. Then, the Maid, who with her white banner 
stood beside the King in that hour of his triumph, kneeled 
down upon the pavement at his feet, and said, with tears, 
that what she had been inspired to do, was done, and that 
the only recompense she asked for, was, that she should now 
have leave to go back to her distant home, and her sturdily 
incredulous father, and her first simple escort the village 
wheelwright and cart-maker. But the King said “ No ! ” 
and made her and her family as noble as a King could, and 
settled upon her the income of a Count. 

Ah ! happy had it been for the Maid of Orleans, if slue 
had resumed her rustic dress that day, and had gone home 
to the little chapel and the wild hills, and had forgotten 
all these things, and had been a good man’s wife, and had 
heard no stranger voices than the voices of little chil- 
dren ! 

It was not to be, and she continued helping the King 
(she did a world for him, in alliance with Friar Richard), 
and trying to improve the lives of the coarse soldiers, and 
leading a religious, an unselfish, and a modest life, herself, 
beyond any doubt. Still, many times she prayed the King 
to let her go home ; and once she even took off her bright 
armour and hung it up in a church, meaning never to wear 
it more. But, the King always won her back again — while 
she was of any use to him — and so she went on and on and 
on, to her doom. 

When the Duke of Bedford, who was a very able man, 
began to be active for England, and, by bringing the wav 
back into France and by holding the Duke of Burgundy to 
his faith, to distress and disturb Charles very much, Charles 
sometimes asked the Maid of Orleans what the Voices said 
about it? But, the Voices had become (very like ordinary 
voices in perplexed times) contradictory and confused, so 
that now they said one thing, and now said another, and 
the Maid lost credit every day. Charles marched on Paris, 
which was opposed to him, and attacked the suburb of 
Saint Honord. In this fight, being again struck down into 
the ditch, she was abandoned by the whole army. She lay 
unaided among a heap of dead, and crawled out how she

could. Then, some of her believers went over to an oppo- 
sition Maid, Catherine of La Rochelle, who said she was 
inspired to tell where there were treasures of buried money 
— though she never did — and then Joan accidentally broke 
the old, old sword, and others said that her power was 
broken with it. Finally, at the siege of Compi&gne, held 
by the Duke of Burgundy, where she did valiant service, 
she was basely left alone in a retreat, though facing about 
and fighting to the last ; and an archer pulled her off her 
horse. 

0 the uproar that was made, and the thanksgivings that 
were sung, about the capture of this one poor country-girl ! 
O the way in which she was demanded to be tried for sor- 
cery and heresy, and anything else you like, by the Inquis- 
itor-General of France, and by this great man, and by that 
great man, until it is wearisome to think of! She was 
bought at last by the Bishop of Beauvais for ten thousand 
francs, and was shut up in her narrow prison : plain Joan 
of Arc again, and Maid of Orleans no more. 

1 should never have done if I were to tell you how they 
had Joan out to examine her, and cross-examine her, and 
re-examine her, and worry her into saying anything and 
everything; and how all sorts of scholars and doctors be- 
stowed their utmost tediousness upon her. Sixteen times 
she was brought out and shut up again, and worried, and 
entrapped, and argued with, until she was heart-sick of the 
dreary business. On the last occasion of this kind she was 
brought into a burial-place at Rouen, dismally decorated 
with a scaffold, and a stake and faggots, and the execu- 
tioner, and a pulpit with a friar therein, and an awful ser- 
mon ready. It is very affecting to know that even at that 
pass the poor girl honoured the mean vermin of a King, 
who had so used her for his purposes and so abandoned her ; 
and, that while she had been regardless of reproaches 
heaped upon herself, she spoke out courageously for him. 

It was natural in one so young to hold to life. To save 
her life, she signed a declaration prepared for her — signed 
it with a cross, for she couldn’t write — that all her visious 
and Voices had come from the Devil. Upon her recanting 
the past, and protesting that she would never wear a man’s 
dress in future, she was condemned to imprisonment for 
life, “on the bread of sorrow and the water of afflic- 
tion.”

But, on the bread of sorrow and the water of affliction, 
the visions and the Voices soon returned. It was quite 
natural that they should do so, for that kind of disease is 
much aggravated by fasting, loneliness, and anxiety of 
mind. It was not only got out of J oan that she considered 
herself inspired again, but, she was taken in a man’s dress, 
which had been left— to entrap her— in her prison, and 
which she put on, in her solitude j perhaps, in remembrance 
of her past glories, perhaps, because the imaginary Voices 
told her. For this relapse into the sorcery and heresy and 
anything else you like* she was sentenced to be burnt to 
death. And, in the market-place of Rouen, in the hideous 
dress which the monks had invented for such spectacles;, 
with priests and bishops sitting in a gallery looking on, 
though some had the Christian grace to go away, unable to 
endure the infamous scene ; this shrieking girl — last seen 
amidst the smoke and fire, holding a crucifix between her 
hands ; last heard, calling upon Christ — was burnt to ashes. 
They threw her ashes into the river Seine ; but they will 
rise against her murderers on the last day. 

From the moment of her capture, neither the French 
King nor one single man in all his court raised a finger to 
save her. It is no defence of them that they may have 
never really believed in her, or that they may have won her 
victories by their skill and bravery. The more they pre- 
tended to believe in her, the more they had caused her to 
believe in herself ; and she had ever been true to them, ever 
brave, ever nobly devoted. But, it is no wonder, that they, 
who were in all things false to themselves, false to one 
another, false to their country, false to Heaven, false to 
Earth, should be monsters of ingratitude and treachery to 
a helpless peasant girl. 

In the picturesque old town of Rouen, whei'e weeds and 
grass grow high on the cathedral towers, and the venerable 
Norman Btreets are still warm in the blessed sunlight 
though the monkish fires that once gleamed horribly upon, 
them have long grown (told, there is a statue of Joaii of 
Arc, in the scene of her last agony, the square to which 
she has given its present name. I know some statues of 
modern times — even in the World’s metropolis, I think — 
which commemorate less constancy, less earnestness, 
smaller claims upou the world’s attention, and much greater 
impostors.

PART THE THIRD. 

Bad deeds seldom prosper, happily for mankind; and the 
English cause gained no advantage from the cruel death of 
Joan of Arc. For a long time, the war went heavily on. 
The Duke of Bedford died; the alliance with the Duke of 
Burgundy was broken; and Lord Talbot became a great 
general on the English side in France. But, two of the 
consequences of wars are, Famine — because the people 
cannot peacefully cultivate the ground — and Pestilence, 
which comes of want, misery, and suffering. Both these 
horrors broke out in both countries, and lasted for two 
wretched years. Then, the war went on again, and came 
by slow degrees to be so badly conducted by the English 
government, that, within twenty years from the execution 
of the Maid of Orleans, of all the great French conquests, 
the town of Calais alone remained in English hands. 

While these victories and defeats were taking place in the 
course of time, many strange things happened at home. 
The young King, as he grew up, proved to be very unlike 
his great father, and showed himself a miserable puny, 
creature. There was no harm in him — he had a great 
aversion to shedding blood : which was something — but, he 
was a weak, silly, helpless young man, and a mere shuttle- 
cock to the great lordly battledores about the Court. 

Of these battledores, Cardinal Beaufort, a relation of the 
King, and the Duke of Gloucester, were at first the most 
powerful. The Duke of Gloucester had a wife, who was 
nonsensically accused of practising witchcraft to cause the 
King’s death and lead to her husband’s coming to the throne, 
he being the next heir. She was charged with having, by 
the help of a ridiculous old woman named Margery (who 
was called a witch), made a little waxen doll in the King’s 
likeness, and put it before a slow fire that it might gradu- 
ally melt away. It was supposed, in such cases, that the 
death of the person whom the doll was made to represent, 
was sure to happen. Whether the duchess was as ignorant 
as the rest of them, and really did make such a doll with 
such an intention, I don’t know ; but, you and I know very 
well that she might have made a thousand dolls, if she had 
been stupid enough, and might have melted them all, with- 
out hurting the King or anybody else. -However, she was

tried for it, and so was old Margery, and so was one of the 
duke’s chaplains, who was charged with having assisted 
them. Both he and Margery were put to death, and the 
duchess, after being taken on foot and bearing a lighted 
candle, three times round the City, as a penance, was im- 
prisoned for life. The duke, himself, took all this pretty 
quietly, and made as little stir about the matter as if he 
were rather glad to be rid of the duchess. 

But, he was not destined to keep himself out of trouble 
long. The royal shuttlecock being three-and-twenty, the 
battledores were very anxious to get him married. The 
Duke of Gloucester wanted him to marry a daughter of 
the Count of Armagnac ; but, the Cardinal and the Earl of 
Suffolk were all for Margaret, the daughter of the King 
of Sicily, who they knew was a resolute ambitious woman 
and would govern the King as she chose. To make 
friends with this lady, the Earl of Suffolk, who went over 
to arrange the match, consented to accept her for the 
King’s wife without any fortune, and even to give up the 
two most valuable, possessions England then had in France. 
So, the marriage was arranged, on terms very advantageous 
to the lady ; and Lord Suffolk brought her to England, and 
she was married at Westminster. On what pretence this 
Queen and her party charged the Duke of Gloucester with 
high treason within a couple of years, it is impossible to 
make out, the matter is so confused ; but, they pretended 
that the King’s life was in danger, and they took the duke 
prisoner. A fortnight afterwards, he was found dead in 
bed (they said), and his body was shown to the people, 
and Lord Suffolk came in for the best part of his estates. 
You know by this time how .strangely liable state prisoners 
were to sudden death. 

If Cardinal Beaufort had any hand in this matter, it did 
him no good, for he died within six weeks $ thinking it 
very hard and curious — at eighty years old!— that he could 
not live to be Pope. 

This was the time when England had completed her loss 
of all her great French conquests. The people charged the 
loss principally upon the Earl of Suffolk, now a duke, who 
had made those easy terms about the Royal Marriage, and 
who, they believed, had even been bought by France. So 
he was impeached as a traitor, on a great number of 
charges, but chiefly on accusations of having . aided the

French King, and of designing to make his own son King 
of England. The Commons and the people being violent 
against him, the King was made (by his friends) to inter- 
pose to save him, by banishing him for five years, and pro- 
roguing the Parliament. The duke had much ado to es- 
cape from a London mob, two thousand strong, who lay in 
wait for him in Saint Giles’s fields; but, he got down to 
his own estates in Suffolk, and sailed away from Ipswich. 
Sailing across the Channel, he sent into Calais to know if 
he might land there ; but, they kept his boat and men in 
the harbour, until an English ship, carrying a hundred and 
fifty men and called the Nicholas of the Tower, came 
alongside his little vessel, and ordered him on board. 
“ Welcome, traitor, as men say,” was the captain’s grim 
and not very respectful salutation. He was kept on board, 
a prisoner, for eight-and-forty hours, and then a small 
boat appeared rowing toward the ship. As this boat came 
nearer, it was seen to have in it a block, a rusty sword, and 
an executioner in a black mask. The duke was handed 
down into it, and there his head was cut off with six strokes 
of the rusty sword. Then, the little boat rowed away to 
Dover beach, where the body was cast out, and left until 
the duchess claimed it. By whom, high in authority, this 
murder was committed, had never appeared. No one was 
ever punished for it. 

There now arose in Kent an Irishman, who gave himself 
the name of Mortimer, but whose real name was Jack 
Cadk. Jack, in imitation of Wat Tyler, though he was a 
very different and inferior sort of man, addressed the 
Kentish men upon their wrongs, occasioned by the bad 
government of England, among so many battledores and 
such a poor shuttlecock ; and the Kentish men rose up to 
the number of twenty thousand. Their place of assembly 
was Blackheath, where, headed by Jack, they put forth 
two papers, which they called w The Complaint of the 
Commons of Kent,” and “The Requests of the Captain 
of the Great Assembly in Kent.” They then retired to 
Sevenoaks. The royal army coming up with them here, 
they beat it and killed their general. Then, Jack dressed 
himself in the dead general’s armour, and led his men to 
London. 

Jack passed into the City from Southwark, over the 
bridge, and entered it in triumph, giving the strictest orders

A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


199 


to his men not to plunder. Haying made a show of his 
forces there, while the citizens looked on quietly, he went 
back into Southwark in good order, and passed the night. 
Next day, he came back again, having got hold in the mean* 
time of Lord Say, an unpopular nobleman. Says Jack to 
the Lord Mayor and judges; “ Will you be so good as to 
make a tribunal in Guildhall, and try me this nobleman? ” 
The court being hastily made, he was found guilty, and 
Jack and his men cut his head off on Cornhill. They also 
cut off the head of his son-in-law, and then went back in 
good order to Southwark again. 

But, although the citizens could bear the beheading of 
an unpopular lord, they could not bear to haye their houses 
pillaged. And it did so happen that Jack, after dinner — 
perhaps he had drunk a little too much — began to plunder 
the house where he lodged; upon which, of course, his 
men began to imitate him. Wherefore, the Londoners took 
counsel with Lord Seales, who had a thousand soldiers in 
the Tower; and defended London Bridge, and kept Jack 
and his people out. This advantage gained, it was resolved 
by divers great men to divide Jack’s army in the old way, 
by making a great many promises on behalf of the state, 
that were never intended to be performed. This did divide 
them; some of Jack’s men saying that they ought to take 
the conditions which were offered, and others saying that 
they ought not, for they were only a snare ; some going 
home at once; others staying where they were; and all 
doubting and quarrelling among themselves. 

Jack, who was in two minds about fighting or accepting 
a pardon, and who indeed did bpth, saw at last that there 
was nothing to expect from his men, and that it was very 
likely some of them would deliver him up and get a reward 
of a thousand marks, which was offered for his apprehen- 
sion. So, after they had travelled and quarrelled all the 
way from Southwark to Blackheatb, and from Blackheath 
to Rochester, he mounted a good horse and galloped away 
into Sussex. But, there galloped after him, on a better 
horse, one Alexander Iden, who came up with him, had 
a hard fight with him, and killed him. Jack’s head was 
set aloft on London Bridge, with the face looking towards 
Blackheath, where he had raised his flag; and Alexander 
Iden got the thousand marks. 

It is supposed by some, that the Duke of York, who had 


Digitized by Google 



200 


A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


been removed from a high post abroad through the Queen’s 
influence, and sent out of the way, to govern Ireland, was 
at the bottom of this rising of Jack and his men, because 
he wanted to trouble the government. He claimed (though 
not yet publicly) to have a better right to the throne than 
Henry of Lancaster, as one of the family of the Earl of 
March, whom Henry the Fourth had set aside. Touching 
this claim, which, being through female relationship, was 
not according to the usual descent, it is enough to say that 
Henry the Fourth was the free choice of the people and the 
Parliament, and that his family had now reigned undisputed 
for sixty years. The memory of Henry the Fifth was so 
famous, and the English people loved it so much, that the 
Duke of York’s claim would, perhaps, never have been 
thought of (it would have been so hopeless) but for the un- 
fortunate circumstance of the present King’s being by this 
time quite an idiot, and the country very ill governed. 
These two circumstances gave the Duke of York a power 
he could not otherwise have had. 

Whether the duke knew anything of Jack Cade, or not, 
he came over from Ireland while Jack’s head was on Lon- 
don Bridge ; being secretly advised that the Queen was set- 
ting up his enemy, the Duke of Somerset, against him. 
He went to Westminster, at the head of four thousand men, 
and on his knees before the King, represented to him the 
bad state of the country, and petitioned him to summon 
a Parliament to consider it. This the King promised. 
When the Parliament was summoned, the Duke of York 
accused the Duke of Somerset, and the Duke of Somerset 
accused the Duke of York; and, both in and out of Parlia- 
ment, the followers of each party were full of violence and 
hatred towards the other. At length the Duke of York put 
himself at the head of a large force of his tenants, and, in 
arms, demanded the reformation of the Government. Be- 
ing shut out of London, he encamped at Dartford, and 
the royal army encamped at Blackheath. According as 
either side triumphed, the Duke of York was arrested, or 
the Duke of Somerset was arrested. The trouble ended, 
for the moment, in the Duke of York renewing his oath 
of allegiance, and going in peace to one of his own 
castles. 

Half a year afterwards the Queen gave birth to a son, 
who was very ill received by the people, and not believed

to be the son of the King. It shows the Duke of York to 
have been a moderate man, unwilling to involve England in 
new troubles, that he did not take advantage of the gen- 
eral discontent at this time, but really acted for the public 
good. He was made a member of the cabinet, and the 
King being now so much worse that he could not be carried 
about and shown to the people with any decency, the duke 
was made Lord Protector of the kingdom, until the King 
should recover, or the Prince should come of age. At the 
same time the Duke of Somerset was committed to the 
Tower. So, now the Duke of Somerset was down, and 
the Duke of York was up. By the end of the year, how- 
ever, the King recovered his memory and some spark of 
sense; upon which the Queen used her power — which 
recovered with him — to get the Protector disgraced, and her 
favourite released. So now the Duke of York was down, 
and the Duke of Somerset was up. 

These ducal ups and downs gradually separated the 
whole nation into the two parties of York and Lancaster, 
and led to those terrible civil wars long known as the Wars 
of the Red and White Roses, because the red rose was the 
badge of the House of Lancaster, and the white rose was 
the badge of the House of York. 

The Duke of York, joined by some other powerful noble- 
men of the White Rose party, and leading a small army, 
met the King with another small army at St. Alban’s, and 
demanded that the Duke of Somerset should be given up. 
The poor King, being made to say in answer that he would 
sooner die, was instantly attacked. The Duke of Somer- 
set was killed, and the King himself was wounded in the 
neck, and took refuge in the house of a poor tanner. 
Whereupon, the Duke of York went to him, led him with 
great submission to the Abbey, and said he was very sorry 
for what had happened. Having now the King in his pos- 
session, he got a Parliament summoned and himself once 
more made Protector, but, only for a few months; for, on 
the King getting a little better again, the Queen and her 
party got him into their possession, and disgraced the duke 
once more. So, now the Duke of York was down again. 

Some of the best men in power, seeing the danger of 
these constant changes, tried even then to prevent the Red 
and the White Rose Wars. They brought about a great 
council in London between the two parties. The White

Roses assembled in Blackfriars, the Red Roses in White- 
friars; and some good priests communicated between them, 
and made the proceedings known at evening to the King 
and the judges. They ended in a peaceful agreement that 
there should be no more quarrelling ; and there was a great 
royal procession to Saint Paurs, in which the Queen walked 
arm-in-arm with her old enemy, the Duke of York, to 
show the people how comfortable they all were. This 
state of peace lasted half a year, when a dispute between 
the Earl of Warwick (one of the Duke’s powerful friends) 
and some of the King’s servants at Court, led to an 
attack upon that Earl — who was a White Rose— and to a 
sudden breaking out of all old animosities. So, here were 
greater ups and downs than ever. 

There were even greater ups and downs than these, soon 
after. After various battles, the Duke of York fled to Ire- 
land, and his son the Earl of March to Calais, with their 
friends the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick ; and a Parlia- 
ment was held declaring them all traitors. Little the 
worse for this, the Earl of Warwick presently came back, 
landed in Kent, was joined by the Archbishop of Canter- 
bury and other powerful noblemen and gentlemen, engaged 
the King’s forces at Northampton, signally defeated them, 
and took the King himself prisoner, who was found in his 
tent. Warwick would have been glad, I dare say, to have 
taken the Queen and Prince too, but they escaped into 
Wales and thence into Scotland. 

The King was carried by the victorious force straight to 
London, and made to call a new Parliament, which imme- 
diately declared that the Duke of York and those other 
noblemen were not traitors, but excellent subjects. Then, 
back comes the duke from Ireland at the head of five hun- 
dred horsemen, rides from London to Westminster, and en- 
ters the House of Lords. There, he laid his hand upon the 
cloth of gold which covered the empty throne, as if he had 
half a mind to sit down in it — but he did not On the 
Archbishop of Canterbury asking him if he would visit the 
King, who was in his palace close by, he replied “ I know 
no one in this country, my lord, who ought not to visit 
me None of the lords present spoke a single word; so, 
the duke went out as he had come, in, established himself 
royally in the King’s palace, and, six days afterwards, 
sent in to the Lords a formal statement of bis claim to the

throne. The Lords went to the King on this momentous 
subject, and after a great deal of discussion, in which the 
judges and the other law officers were afraid to give an 
opinion on either side, the question was compromised. It 
was agreed that the present King should retain the crown 
for his life, and that it should then pass to the Duke of 
York and his heirs. 

But, the resolute Queen, determined on asserting her 
son’s right, would hear of no such thing She oame from 
Scotland to the north of England, where several powerful 
lords armed in her cause. The Duke of York, for his part, 
set off with some five thousand men, a little time before 
Christmas Day, one thousand four hundred and sixty, to 
give her battle. He lodged at Sandal Castle, near Wake- 
fied, and the Red Roses defied him to come out on Wake- 
field Green, and fight them then and there. His generals 
said, he had best wait until his gallant son, the Earl of 
March, came up with his power ; but, he was determined 
to accept the^challenge. He did so, in an evil hour. He 
was hotly pressed on all sides, two thousand of his men lay 
dead on Wakefield Green, and he himself was taken pris- 
oner. They set him down in mock state on an ant-hill, 
and twisted grass about his head, and pretended to pay 
court to him on their knees, saying, “ 0 King, without a 
kingdom, and Prince without a people, we hope your gra- 
cious Majesty is very well and happy ! ” They did worse 
than this 5 they cut his head off, and handed it on a pole to 
the Queen, who laughed with delight when she saw it (you 
recollect their walking so religiously and comfortably to 
Saint Paul’s!), and had it fixed, with a paper crown upon 
its head, on the walls of York. The Earl of Salisbury lost 
his head, too; and the Duke of York’s second son, a hand- 
some boy who was flying with his tutor over Wakefield 
Bridge, was stabbed in the heart by a murderous lord— 
Lord Clifford by name* — whose father had been killed by 
the White Roses in the fight at St. Alban’s. There was 
awful sacrifice of life in this battle, for no quarter was 
given, and the Queen was wild for revenge. When men 
unnaturally fight against their own countrymen, they are 
always observed to be more unnaturally cruel and filled 
with rage than they are against any other enemy. 

But, Lord Clifford had stabbed the second son of the 
Duke of York — not the first. The eldest son, Edward Ear}

of March, was at Gloucester ; and, vowing vengeance for 
the death of his father, his brother, and their faithful 
friends, he began to march against the Queen. He had to 
turn and fight a great body of Welsh and Irish first, who 
worried his advance. These he defeated in a great fight at 
Mortimer’s Cross, near Hereford, where he beheaded a 
number of the Red Roses taken in battle, in retaliation for 
the beheading of the White Roses at Wakefield. The 
Queen had the next turn of beheading. Having moved 
towards London, and falling in, between St. Alban’s and 
Barnet, with the Earl of Warwick and the Duke of Nor- 
folk, White Roses both, who were there with an army to 
oppose her, and had got the King with them ; she defeated 
them with great loss, and struck off the heads of two pris- 
oners of note, who were in the King’s tent with him, and 
to whom the King had promised his protection. Her tri- 
umph, however, was very short. She had no treasure, and 
her army subsisted by plunder. This caused them to be 
hated and dreaded by the people, and particularly by the 
London people, who were wealthy. As soon as the Lon- 
doners heard that Edward, Earl of March, united with the 
Earl of Warwick, was advancing towards the city, they re- 
fused to send the Queen supplies, and made a great rejoic- 
ing. 

The Queen and her men retreated with all speed, and 
Edward and Warwick came on, greeted with loud acclama- 
tions on every side. The courage, beauty, and virtues of 
young Edward could not be sufficiently praised by the 
whole people. He rode into London like a conqueror, and 
met with an enthusiastic welcome. A few days afterwards, 
Lord Falconbridge and the Bishop of Exeter assembled the 
citizens in Saint John’s Field, Clerkenwell, and asked them 
if they would have Henry of Lancaster for their King? To 
this they all roared, “No, no, no! ” and “King Edward! 
King Edward! ” Then, said those noblemen, would they 
love and serve young Edward! To this they all cried, 
“ Yes, yes ! ” and threw up their caps and clapped their 
hands, and cheered tremendously. 

Therefore, it was declared that by joining the Queen and 
not protecting those two prisoners of note, Henry of Lan- 
caster had forfeited the crown ; and Edward of York was 
proclaimed King. He made a great speech to the ap- 
plauding people at Westminster, and sat down as Bover*

eign of England on that throne, on the golden covering of 
which his father — worthy of a better fate than the bloody 
axe which cut the thread of so many lives in England, 
through so many years — had laid his hand. 


CHAPTER XXIII. 

ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FOURTH. 

King Edward the Fourth was not quite twenty-one 
years of age when he took that unquiet seat upon the 
throne of England. The Lancaster party, the Red Roses, 
were then assembling in great numbers near York, and it 
was necessary to give them battle instantly. But, the stout 
Earl of Warwick leading for the young King, and the 
young King himself closely following him, and the Eng- 
lish people crowding round the Royal standard, the White 
and the Red Roses met, on a wild March day when the 
snow was falling heavily, at Towton; and there such a 
furious battle raged between them, that the total loss 
amounted to forty thousand men — all Englishmen, fight- 
ing, upon English ground, against one another. The 
young King gained the day, took down the heads of his 
father and brother from the walls of York, and put up the 
heads of some of the most famous noblemen engaged in the 
battle on the other side. Then, he went to London and 
was crowned with great splendour. 

A new Parliament met. No fewer than one hundred 
and fifty of the principal noblemen and gentlemen on the 
Lancaster side were declared traitors, and the King — who 
had very little humanity, though he was handsome in per- 
son and agreeable in manners — resolved to do all he could, 
to pluck up the Red Rose root and branch. 

Queen Margaret, however, was still active for her young 
son. She obtained help from Scotland and from Nor- 
mandy, and took several important English castles. But, 
Warwick soon retook them ; the Queen lost all her treasure 
on board ship in a great storm ; and both she and her son 
suffered great misfortunes. Once, in the winter weather, 
as they were riding through a forest, they were attached

and plundered by a party of robbers 5 and, when they had 
escaped from these men and were passing alone mid on foot 
through a thick dark part of the wood, they came, all at 
once, upon another robber. So the Queen, with a Bfcout 
heart, took the little Prince by the hand, and going 
straight up to that robber, said to him, “ My friend, this 
is the young son of your lawful King! I confide him to 
your care.” The robber was surprised, but took the boy 
in his arms, and faithfully restored him and his mother 
to their friends. In the end, the Queen’s soldiers being 
beaten and dispersed, she went abroad again, and kept quiet 
for the present. 

Now, all this time, the deposed King Henry was con- 
cealed by a Welsh knight, who kept him close in his cas- 
tle. But, next year, the Lancaster party recovering their 
'spirits, raised a large body of men, and called him out of 
his retirement, to put him at their head. They were 
joined by some powerful noblemen who had sworn fidelity 
to the new King, but who were ready, as usual, to break 
their oaths, whenever they thought there was anything to 
be got by it. One of the worst things in the history of the 
war of the Red and White Roses is the ease with which 
these noblemen, who should have set an example of hon- 
our to the people, left either side as they took slight of- 
fence, or were disappointed in their greedy expectations, 
and joined the other. Well ! Warwick’s brother soon beat 
the Lancastrians, and the false noblemen, being taken, 
were beheaded without a moment’s loss of time. The de- 
posed King had a narrow escape; three of his servants 
were taken, and one of them bore his cap of estate, which 
was set with pearls and embroidered with two golden 
crowns. However, the head to which the cap belonged got 
safely into Lancashire, and lay pretty quietly there (the 
people in the secret being very true) for more than a year. 
At length, an old monk gave such intelligence as led to 
Henry’s being taken while he was sitting at dinner in a 
place called Waddington Hall. He was immediately sent 
to London, and met at Islington by the Earl of Warwick, 
by whose directions he was put upon a horse, with his legs 
tied under it, and paraded three times round the pillory. 
Then, he was carried off to the Tower, where they treated 
him well enough. 

The White Rose being so triumphant, the young King

abandoned himself entirely to pleasure, and led a jovial 
life. But, thorns were springing up under his bed of roses, 
as he soon found out. For, having been privately married 
to Elizabeth Woodville, a young widow lady, very beau- 
tiful and very captivating; and at last resolving to make 
his secret known, and to declare her his Queen ; he gave 
some offence to the Earl of Warwick, who was usually 
called the King-Maker, because of his power and influence, 
and because of his having lent such great help to placing 
Edward on the throne. This offence was not lessened 
by the jealousy with which the Nevil family (the Earl of 
Warwick’s) regarded the promotion of the Woodville fam- 
ily. For, the young Queen was so bent on providing for 
her relations, that she made her father an earl and a great 
officer of state ; married her five sisters to young noblemen 
of the highest rank ; and provided for her younger brother, 
a young man of twenty, by marrying him to an immensely 
rich old duchess of eighty. The Earl of Warwick took all 
this pretty graciously for a man of his proud temper, until 
the question arose to whom the King’s sister, Mar&aret, 
should be married. The Earl of Warwick said, “To one 
of the French King’s sons,” and was allowed to go over to 
the French King to make friendly proposals for that pur- 
pose, and to hold all manner of friendly interviews with 
him. But, while he was so engaged, the Woodville party 
married the young lady to the Duke of Burgundy! Upon 
this he came back in great rage and scorn, and shut himself 
up discontented, in his Castle of Middleham. 

A reconciliation, though not a very sincere one, was 
patched up between the Earl of Warwick and the King, 
and lasted until the earl married his daughter, against the 
King’s wishes, to the Duke of Clarence. While the mar- 
riage was being celebrated at Calais, the people in the north 
of England, where the influence of the Nevil family was 
strongest, broke out into rebellion; their complaint was, 
that England was oppressed and plundered by the Wood- 
ville family, whom they demanded to have removed from 
power. As they were joined by great numbers of people, 
and as they openly declared that they were supported by 
the Earl of Warwick, the King did not know what to do. 
At last, as he wrote to the earl beseeching his

Castle in the safe keeping of the Archbishop of York; so 
England was not only in the strange position of having 
two Kings at once, but they were both prisoners at the 
same time. 

Even as yet, however, the King-Maker was so far true 
to the King, that he dispersed a new rising of the Lancas- 
trians, took their leader prisoner, and brought him to the 
King, who ordered him to be immediately executed. He 
presently allowed the King to return to London, and there 
innumerable pledges of forgiveness and friendship were ex- 
changed between them, and between the Nevils and the 
Woodvilles; the King’s eldest daughter was promised in 
marriage to the heir of the Nevil family ; and more friendly 
oaths were sworn, and more friendly promises made, than 
this book would hold. 

They lasted about three months. At the end of that 
time, the Archbishop of York made a feast for the King, 
the Earl of Warwick, and the Duke of Clarence, at his 
house, the Moor, in Hertfordshire. The King was wash- 
ing his hands before supper, when some one whispered him 
that a body of a hundred men were lying in ambush out- 
side the house. Whether this were true or untrue, the 
King took fright, mounted his horse, and rode through the 
dark night to Windsor Castle. Another reconciliation was 
patched up between him and the King-Maker, but it was a 
short one, and it was the last. A new rising took place in 
Lincolnshire, and the King marched to repress it. Having 
done so, he proclaimed that both the Earl of Warwick and 
the Duke of Clarence were traitors, who had secretly as- 
sisted it, and who had been prepared publicly to join it on 
the following day. In these dangerous circumstances they 
both took ship and sailed away to the French court. 

And here a meeting took place between the Earl of War- 
wick and his old enemy, the Dowager Queen Margaret, 
through whom his father had had his head struck off, and 
to whom he had been a bitter foe. But, now, when he 
said that he had done with the ungrateful and perfidious 
Edward of York, and that henceforth he devoted himself 
to the restoration of the House of Lancaster, either in the 
person of her husband or of her little son, she embraced 
him as if he had ever been her dearest friend. She did 
more than that; she married her son to his second daugh- 
ter, the Lady Anne. However agreeable this marriage was

to the new friends, it was very disagreeable to the Duke of 
Clarence, who perceived that his father-in-law, the King- 
Maker, would never make Mm King, now. So, being but 
a weak-minded young traitor, possessed of very little worth 
or sense, he readily listened to an artful court lady sent 
over for the purpose, and promised to turn traitor once 
more, and go over to his brother, King Edward, when a 
fitting opportunity should come. 

The Earl of Warwick, knowing nothing of this, soon re- 
deemed his promise to the Dowager Queen Margaret, by 
invading England and landing at Plymouth, where he in- 
stantly proclaimed King Henry, and summoned all Eng- 
lishmen between the ages of sixteen and sixty, to join his 
banner. Then, with his army increasing as he marched 
along, he went northward, and came so near King Edward, 
who was in that part of the country, that Edward had to 
ride hard for it to the coast of Norfolk, and thence to get 
away in such ships as he could find, to Holland. There- 
upon, the triumphant King-Maker and his false son-in-law, 
the Duke of Clarence, went to London, took the old King 
out of the Tower, and walked him in a great procession to 
Saint PauPs Cathedral with the crown upon his head. 
This did not improve the temper of the Duke of Clarence, 
who saw himself farther off from being King than ever; 
but he kept his secret, and said nothing. The Nevil family 
were restored to all their honours and glories, and the 
Woodvilles and the rest were disgraced. The King-Maker, 
less sanguinary than the King, shed no blood except that 
of the Earl of Worcester, who had been so cruel to the 
people as to have gained the title of the Butcher. Him 
they caught hidden in a tree, and him they tried and exe- 
cuted. No other death stained the King-Maker^ triumph. 

To dispute this triumph, back came King Edward again, 
next year, landing at Ravenspur, coming on to York, 
causing all his men to cry “ Long live King Henry ! ” and 
swearing on the altar, without a blush, that he came to lay 
no claim to the crown. Now was the time for the Duke 
of Clarence, who ordered his men to assume the White 
Rose, and declare for his brother. The Marquis of Mon- 
tague, though the Earl of Warwick’s brother, also declin- 
ing to fight against King Edward, he went on successfully 
to London, where the Archbishop of York let him into the 
City, and where the people made great demonstrations

in his favour. For this they had four reasons. Firstly, 
there were great numbers of the King’s adherents hiding 
in the City and ready to break out ; secondly, the King 
owed them a great deal of money, which they could never 
hope to get if he were unsuccessful ; thirdly, there was a 
young prince to inherit the crown ; and fourthly, the King 
was gay and handsome, and more popular than a better 
man might have been with the City ladies. After a stay 
of only two days with these worthy supporters, the King 
marched out to Barnet Common, to give the Earl of War- 
wick battle. And now it was to be seen, for the last time, 
whether the King or the King-Maker was to carry the day. 

While the battle was yet pending, the faint-hearted Duke 
of Clarence began to repent, and sent over secret messages 
to his father-in-law, offering his services in mediation with 
the King. But, the Earl of Warwick disdainfully rejected 
them, and replied that Clarence was false and perjured, 
and that he would settle the quarrel by the sword. The 
battle began at four o’clock in the morning and lasted until 
ten, and during the greater part of the time it was fought 
in a thick mist — absurdly supposed to be raised by a magi- 
cian. The loss of life was very great, for the hatred was 
strong on both sides. The King-Maker was defeated, and 
the King triumphed. Both the Earl of Warwick and his 
brother were slain, and their bodies lay in Saint Paul’s, for 
some days, as a spectacle to the people. 

Margaret’s spirit was not broken even by this great blow. 
Within five days she was in arms again, and raised her 
standard in Bath, whence she set off with her army, to try 
and join Lord Pembroke, who had a force in Wales, Bui, 
the King, coming up with her outside the town of Tewkes- 
bury, and ordering his brother, the Duke op Gloucester, 
who was a brave soldier, to attack her men, she sustained 
an entire defeat, and was taken prisoner, together with her 
son, now only eighteen years of age. The conduct of the 
King 1 ) this poor youth was worthy of his cruel character. 
He ordered him to be led into his tent. " And what,” said 
he, “brought you to England?” “I came to England,” 
replied the prisoner, with a spirit which a man of spirit 
might have admired in a captive, “ to recover my father’s 
kingdom, which descended to him as his right, and from 
him descends to me, as mine.” The King, drawing off his 
iron gauntlet, strnck him with it in the face; and the Duke

of Clarence and some other lords, who were there, drew 
their noble swords, and killed him. 

His mother survived him, a prisoner, for five years; 
after her ransom by the King of France, she survived for 
six years more. Within three weeks of this murder, Henry 
died one of those convenient sudden deaths which were so 
common in the Tower ; in plainer words, he was murdered 
by the King’s order. 

Having no particular excitement on his hands after this 
great defeat of the Lancaster party, and being perhaps de- 
sirous to get rid of some of his fat (for he was now getting 
•too corpulent to be handsome), the King thought of mak- 
ing war on France; As he wanted more money for this 
purpose than the Parliament could give him, though they 
were usually ready enough for war, he invented a new way 
of raising it, by sending for the principal citizens of London, 
and telling them, with a grave face, that he was very much 
iu want of cash, and would take it very kind in them if 
they would lend him some. It being impossible for them 
safely to refuse, they complied, and the moneys thus forced 
from them were called — no doubt to the great amusement 
of the King and the Court — as if they were free gifts, 
“ Benevolences . n What with grants from Parliament, and 
what with Benevolences, the King raised an army and 
passed over to Calais. As nobody wanted war, however, 
the French King made proposals of peace, which were 
accepted, and a truce was concluded for seven long years. 
The proceedings between the Kings of Fiance and England 
on this occasion were very friendly, very splendid, and 
very distrusfcfiiL They finished with a meeting between 
the two Kings, on a temporary bridge over the river Somme, 
where they embraced through two holes in a strong wooden 
grating like a lion’s cage, and made several bows and fine 
speeches to one another. 

It was time, now, that the Duke of Clarence - should be 
punished for his treacheries ; and Fate had his punishment 
in store. He was, probably, not trusted by the King — for 
who could trust him who knew him ! — and he had certainly 
a powerful opponent in his brother Richard, Duke of 
Gloucester, who, being avaricious and ambitious, wanted 
to marry that widowed daughter of the Earl of Warwick’s 
who had been espoused to the deceased young Prince, at 
Calais. Clarence, who wanted all the family wealth for

himself, secreted this lady, whom Richard found disguised 
as a servant In the City of London, and whom he married ; 
arbitrators appointed by the King then divided the prop- 
erty between the brothers. This led to ill-will and mis- 
trust between them. Clarence's wife, dying, and he wish- 
ing to make another marriage, which was obnoxious to the 
King, his ruin was hurried by that means, too. At first, 
the Court struck at his retainers and dependents, and ac- 
cused some of them of magic and witchcraft, and similar 
nonsense. Successful against this small game, it then 
mounted to the duke himself, who was impeached by his 
brother the King, in person, on a variety of such charges.. 
He was found guilty, and sentenced to be publicly exe- 
cuted. He never was publicly executed, but he met his 
death somehow, in the Tower, and, no doubt, through some 
agency of the King or his brother Gloucester, or both. It 
was supposed at the time that he was told to choose the 
manner of his death, and that he chose to be drowned in a 
butt of Malmsey wine. I hope the story may be true, for 
it would have been a becoming death for such a miserable 
creature. 

The King survived him some five years. He died in the 
forty-second year of his life, and the twenty-third of his 
reign. He had a very good capacity and some good points, 
but he was selfish, careless, sensual, and cruel. He was a 
favourite with the people for his showy manners ; and the 
people were a good example to him in the constancy of 
their attachment. He was penitent on his death-bed for 
his “ Benevolences," and other extortions, and ordered res- 
titution to be made to the people who had suffered from 
them. He also called about his bed the enriched members 
of the Woodville family, and the proud lords whose honours 
were of older date, and endeavoured to reconcile them, for 
the sake of the peaceful succession of his son and the tran- 
quillity of England.

CHAPTER XXIV. 

ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIFTH. 

The late King’s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, called 
Edward after him, was only thirteen years of age at his 
father’s death. He was at Ludlow Castle with his uncle, 
the Earl of Rivers. The prince’s brother, the Duke of 
York, only eleven years of age, was in London with his 
mother. The boldest, most crafty, and most dreaded no- 
bleman in England at that time was their uncle Richard, 
Duke of Gloucester, and everybody wondered how the two 
poor boys would fare with such an uncle for a friend or 
a foe. 

The Queen, their mother, being exceedingly uneasy about 
this, was anxious that instructions should be sent to Lord 
Rivers to raise an army to escort the young King safely to 
London. But, Lord Hastings, who was of the Court party 
opposed to the Woodvilles, and who disliked the thought 
of giving them that power, argued against the proposal, 
and obliged the Queen to be satisfied with an escort of two 
thousand horse. The Duke of Gloucester did nothing, at 
first, to justify suspicion. He came from Scotland (where 
he was commanding an army) to York, and was there the 
first to swear allegiance to his nephew. He then wrote 
a condoling letter to the Queen-Mother, and set off to be 
present at the coronation in London. 

Now, the young King, journeying towards London too, 
with Lord Rivers and Lord Gray, came to Stony Stratford, 
as his uncle came to Northampton, about ten miles distant; 
and when those two lords heard that the Duke of Glouces- 
ter was so near, they proposed to the young King that they 
should go back and greet him in his name. The boy being 
very willing that they should do so, they rode off and were 
received with great friendliness, and asked by the Duke of 
Gloucester to stay and dine with him. In the evening, 
while they were merry together, up came the Duke of 
Buckingham with three hundred horsemen; and next 
morning the two lords and the two dukes, and the three 
hundred horsemen, rode away together to rejoin the King.

A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


Just as they were entering Stony Stratford, the Duke of 
Gloucester, checking his horse, turned suddenly on the two 
lords, charged them with alienating from him the affec- 
tions of his sweet nephew, and caused them to be arrested 
by the three hundred horsemen and taken back. Then, he 
and the Duke of Buckingham went straight to the King 
(whom they had now in their power), to whom they made 
a show of kneeling down, and offering great love and sub- 
mission ; and then they ordered his attendants to disperse, 
and took him, alone with them, to Northampton 

A few days afterwards they conducted him to London, 
and lodged him in the Bishop’s Palace But, he did not 
remain there long; for, the Duke of Buckingham with a 
tender face made a speech expressing how anxious he was 
for the Royal boy’s safety, and how much safer he would 
be in the Tower until his coronation, than he could be 
anywhere else. So, to the Tower he was taken, very 
Carefully, and the Duke of Gloucester was named Pro- 
tector of the State. 

Although Gloucester had proceeded thus far with a very 
smooth countenance — and although he was a clever man, 
fair of speech, and not ill-looking, in spite of one of his 
shoulders being something higher than the other — and 
although he had come into the City riding bare-headed at 
the King’s side, and looking very imd of him' — he had 
made the King’s mother more uneasy yet; and when the 
Royal boy was taken to the Tower, she became so alarmed 
that she took sanctuary in Westminster with her five 
daughters. 

Nor did she do this without reason, for, the Duke of 
Gloucester, finding that the lords who were opposed to the 
Woodville family were faithful to the young King never- 
theless, quickly resolved to strike a blow for himself. Ac- 
cordingly, while those lords met in council at the Tower, 
he and those who were in his interest met in separate coun- 
cil at his own residence, Crosby Palace, in Bishopsgate 
Street. Being at last quite prepared, he one day appeared 
unexpectedly at the couneil in the Tower, and appeared to 
be very jocular and merry. He was particularly gay with 
the Bishop of Ely : praising the strawberries that grew in 
his garden on Holborn Hill, and asking him to have some 
gathered that he might eat them at dinner. The bishop, 
quite proud of the honour, sent one of Ms men to fetch

Some 4 and the duke, still very jocular and gay, went out j 
and the council all said what a very agreeable duke he was! 
In a little time, however, he came back quite altered — not 
at all jocular — frowning and fierce — and suddenly said, — 

“ What do those persons deserve who have compassed 
my destruction; I being the King’s lawful, as well as nat- 
ural, protector? ” 

To this strange question, Lord Hastings replied, that 
they deserved death, whosoever they were* 

“ Then,” said the duke, “ I tell you that they are that 
sorceress my brother’s wife ; ” meaning the Queen : “ and 
that other sorceress, Jane Shore. Who, by witchcraft, 
have withered my body, and caused my arm to shrink as I 
now show you.” 

He then pulled up his sleeve and showed them his arm, 
which was shrunken, it is true, but which had been so, as 
they all very well knew, from the hour of his birth. 

Jane Shore, being then the lover of Lord Hastings, as 
she had formerly been of the late King, that lord knew that 
he himself was attacked. So, he said, in some confusion, 
“Certainly, my Lord, if they have done this, they be 
worthy of punishment.” 

“ If? ” said the Duke of Gloucester ; “ do you talk to me 
of if 8? I tell you that they have so done, and I will make 
it good upon thy body, thou traitor ! ” 

With that, he struck the table a great blow with his fish 
This was a signal to some of his people outside to cry 
“Treason!” They immediately did so, and there was a 
rush into the chamber of so many, armed men that it was 
filled in a moment. 

“First,” said the Duke of Gloucester to Lord Hastings, 
“I arrest thee, traitor! And let him,” he added to the 
armed men who took him, “have a priest at once, for 
by Saint Paul I will not dine until I have seen his head 
off!” 

Lord Hastings was hurried to the green by the Tower 
chapel, and there beheaded on a log of wood that happened 
to be lying on the ground. Then, the duke dined with a 
good appetite, and after dinner summoning the principal 
citizens to attend him, told them that Lord Hastings and 
the rest had designed to murder both himself and the Duke 
of Buckingham, who stood by his side, if he had not provi- 
dentially discovered their design. He requested them to

be so obliging as to inform their fellow-citizens of the truth 
of what he said, and issued a proclamation (prepared and 
neatly copied out beforehand) to the same effect. 

On the same day that the duke did these things in the 
Tower, Sir Richard Ratcliffe, the boldest and most un* 
daunted of his men, went down to Pontefract; arrested 
Lord Rivers, Lord Gray, and two other gentlemen; and 
publicly executed them on the scaffold, without any trial, 
for having intended the duke’s death. Three days after- 
wards the duke, not to lose time, went down the river 
to Westminster in his barge, attended by divers bishops, 
lords, and soldiers, and demanded that the Queen should 
deliver her second son, the Duke of York, into his safe keep- 
ing. The Queen, being obliged to comply, resigned the child 
after she had wept over him ; and Richard of Gloucester 
placed him with his brother in the Tower. Then, he 
seized Jane Shore, and, because she had been the lover of 
the late King, confiscated her property, and got her sen- 
tenced to do public penance in the streets by walking in a 
scanty dress, with bare feet, and carrying a lighted candle, 
to Saint Paul’s Cathedral, through the most crowded part 
of the City. 

Having now all things ready for his own advancement, 
he caused a friar to preach a sermon at the cross which 
stood in front of Saint Paul’s Cathedral, in which he dwelt 
upon the profligate manners of the late King, and upon the 
late shame of Jane Shore, and hinted that the princes were 
not his children. “ Whereas, good people,” said the friar, 
whose name was Shaw, “ my Lord the Protector, the noble 
Duke of Gloucester, that sweet prince, the pattern of all 
the noblest virtues, is the perfect image and express like- 
ness of his father.” There had been a little plot between 
the duke and the friar, that the duke should appear in the 
crowd at this moment, when it was expected that the people 
would cry “ Long live King Richard ! ” But, either through 
the frair saying the words too soon, or through the duke’s 
coming too late, the duke and the words did not come to- 
gether, and the people only laughed, and the friar sneaked 
off ashamed. 

The Duke of Buckingham was a better hand at such busi- 
ness than the friar, so he went to the Guildhall the next 
day, and addressed the citizens in the Lord Protector’s be- 
half. A few dirty men, who had been hired and stationed

there for the purpose, crying when he had done, “ God save 
King Richard ! 99 he made them a great bow, and thanked 
them with all his heart. Next day, to make an end of it, 
he went with the mayor and some lords and citizens to 
Bayard Castle, by the river, where Richard then was, and 
read an address, humbly entreating him to accept the Crown 
of England. Richard, who looked down upon them out of 
a window and pretended to be in great uneasiness and 
alarm, assured them there was nothing he desired less, 
and that his deep affection for his nephews forbade him to 
think of it. To this the Duke of Buckingham replied, 
with pretended warmth, that the free people of England 
would never submit to his nephew’s rule, and that if 
Richard, who was the lawful heir, refused the Crown, why 
then they must find some one else to wear it. The Duke of 
Gloucester returned, that since he used that strong language, 
it became his painful duty to think no more of himself, and 
to accept the Crown. 

Upon that, the people cheered and dispersed ; and the 
Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Buckingham passed a 
pleasant evening, talking over the play they had just acted 
with so much success, and every word of which they had 
prepared together. 


CHAPTER XXV. 

ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE THIRD. 

King Richabd the Third was up betimes in the morn- 
ing, and went to Westminster Hall. In the Hall was a 
marble seat, upon which he sat himself down between two 
great noblemen, and told the people that he began the new 
reign in that place, because the first duty of a sovereign 
was to administer the laws equally to all, and to maintain 
justice. He then mounted his horse and rode back to the 
City, where he was received by the clergy and the crowd 
as if he really had a right to the throne, and really were a 
just man. The clergy and the crowd must have been rather 
ashamed of themselves in secret, I think, for being such 
poor-spirited knayes. 

The new King and his Queen were soon crowned with a

great deal of show and noise, which the people liked very 
much ; and then the King set forth on a royal progress 
through his dominions. He was crowned a second time at 
York, in order that the people might have show and noise 
enough ; and wherever he went was received with shouts of 
rejoicing— from a good many people of strong lungs, who 
were paid to strain their throats in crying, “ God save King 
Richard! ” The plan was so successful that I am told it 
has been imitated since, by other usurpers, in other prog- 
resses through other dominions. 

While he was on this journey, King Richard stayed a 
week at Warwick. And from Warwick he sent instructions 
home for one of the wickedest murders that ever was done 
— the murder of the two young princes, his nephews, who 
were shut up in the Tower of London. 

Sir Robert Bracken bury was at that time Governor of 
the Tower. To him, by the hands of a messenger named 
John- Green, did King Richard send a letter, ordering him 
by some means to put the two young princes to death. But 
Sir Robert — I hope because he had children of liis own, 
and loved them — sent John Green back again, riding and 
spurring along the dusty roads, with the answer that he 
could not do so horrible a piece of work. The King, hav- 
ing frowningly considered a little, called to him Sir James 
Tyrrel, his master of the horse, and to him gave authority 
to take command of the Tower, whenever he would, for 
twenty-four hours, and to keep all the keys of the Tower 
during that space of time. Tyrrel, well knowing what was 
wanted, looked about him for two hardened ruffians, and 
chose John Dighton, one of his own grooms, and Miles 
Forest, who was a murderer by trade. Having secured 
these two assistants, he went, upon a day in August, to 
the Tower, showed his authority from the King, took the 
command for four-and -twenty hours, and obtained posses- 
sion of the keys. And when the black night came, he 
went creeping, creeping, like a gnilty villain as he was, up 
the dkrk stone winding stairs, and along the dark stone 
passages, until he came to the door of the room where the 
two young princes, having said their prayers, lay fast 
asleep, clasped in each other’ s arms. And while he watched 
and listened at the door, he sent in those evil demons, John 
Dighton and Miles Forest, who smothered the two princes

the stairs, and buried them tinder a great heap of stones at 
the staircase foot. And when the day came, he gate up 
the command of the Tower, and restored the keys, and 
hurried away without once looking behind him ; and Sit 
Robert Brackenbury went with fear and sadness to the 
princes* room, and found the princes gone for ever. 

You know, through all this history, how true it is that 
traitors are never true, and you will not be surprised to 
learn that the Duke of Buckingham soon turned against 
King Richard, and joined a great conspiracy that was 
formed to dethrone him, and to place the crown upon its 
rightful owner's head. Richard had meant to keep the 
murder secret; but when he heard through his spies that 
this conspiracy existed, and that many lords and gentlemen 
drank in secret to the healths of the two young princes in 
the Tower, he made it known that they were dead. The 
conspirators, though thwarted for a moment, soon resolved 
to set up for the crown against the murderous Richard, 
Henry Earl of Richmond, grandson of Catherine: that 
widow of Henry the Fifth who married Owen Tudor. And 
as Henry was of the house of Lancaster, they proposed 
that he should marry the Princess Elizabeth, the eldest 
daughter of the late King, now the heiress of the house of 
York, and thus by uniting the rival families put an $nd 
to the fatal wars of the Red and White Roses. All being 
settled, a time was appointed for Henry to come over from 
Brittany, and for a great rising against Richard, to take 
place in several parts of England at the. same hours. On 
a certain day, therefore, in October, the revolt took place; 
but unsuccessfully. Richard was prepared, Henry was 
driven back at sea by a storm, his followers in England 
were dispersed, and the Duke of Buckingham was taken, 
and at once beheaded in the market-place at Salisbury. 

The time of his success was a good time, Richard thought, 
for summoning a Parliament and getting some money. So, 
a Parliament was called, and it flattered and fawned upon 
him as much as he oould possibly desire, and declared him 
to be the rightful King of England, and his only son 
Edward, then eleven years of age, the next heir to the 
throne. 

Richard knew full well that, let the Parliament say what 
it would, the Princess Elizabeth was remembered by people 
as the heiress of the house of York; and having accurate

information besides, of its being designed by the conspira- 
tors to marry her to Henry of Richmond, he felt that it 
would much strengthen him and weaken them, to be before- 
hand with them, and marry her to his son. With this 
view he went to the Sanctuary at Westminster, where the 
late King’s widow and daughter still were, and besought 
them to come to Court : where (he swore by anything and 
everything) they should be safely and honourably enter- 
tained. They came, accordingly, but had scarcely been at 
Court a month when his son died suddenly — or was poi- 
soned — and his plan was crushed to pieces. 

In this extremity, King Richard, always active, thought, 
“I must make another plan.” And he made the plan of 
marrying the Princess Elizabeth himself, although she was 
his niece. There was one difficulty in the way : his wife, 
the Queen Anne, was alive. But, he knew (remembering 
his nephews) how to remove that obstacle, and he made 
love to the Princess Elizabeth, telling her he felt perfectly 
confident that the Queen would die in February. The 
Princess was not a very scrupulous young lady, for, instead 
of rejecting the murderer of her brothers with scorn and 
hatred, she openly declared she loved him dearly; and, 
when February came and the Queen did not die, she 
expressed her impatient opinion that she was too long about 
it. However, King Richard was not so far out in his pre- 
diction, but that she died in March — he took good care of 
that — and then this precious pair hoped to be married. 
But they were disappointed, for the idea of such a marriage 
was so unpopular in the country, that the King’s chief 
counsellors, Ratcliffe and Catesby, would by no means 
undertake to propose it, and the King was even obliged to 
declare in public that he had never thought of such a thing. 

He was, by this time, dreaded and hated by all classes 
of his subjects. His nobles deserted every day to Henry’s 
side ; he dared not call another Parliament, lest his crimes 
should be denounced there ; and for want of money, he was 
obliged to get Benevolences from the citizens, which exas- 
perated them all against him. It was said too, that, being 
stricken by his conscience, he dreamed frightful dreams, 
and started up in the night-time, wild with terror and re- 
morse. Active to the last, through all this, he issued vig- 
orous proclamations against Henry of Richmond and all his 
followers, when he heard that they were coining against

him with a Fleet from France ; and took the field as fierce 
and savage as a wild boar — the animal represented on his 
shield. 

Henry of Richmond landed with six thousand men at 
Milford Haven, and came on against King Richard, then 
encamped at Leicester with an army twice as great, through 
North Wales. On Bosworth Field the two armies met; 
and Richard, looking along Henry’s ranks, and seeing them 
crowded with the English nobles who had abandoned him, 
turned pale when he beheld the powerful Lord Stanley and 
his son (whom he had tried hard to retain) among them. 
But, he was as brave as he was wicked, ana plunged into 
the thickest of the fight. He was riding hither and thither, 
laying about him in all directions, when he observed the 
Earl of Northumberland — one of his few great allies — to 
stand inactive, and the main body of his troops to hesitate. 
At the same moment, his desperate glance caught Henry 
of Richmond among a little group of his knights. Riding 
hard at him, and crying “ Treason ! ” he killed his standard- 
bearer, fiercely unhorsed another gentleman, and aimed a 
powerful stroke at Henry himself, to cut him down. But, 
Sir William Stanley parried it as it fell, and before Richard 
could raise his arm again, he was borne down in a press of 
numbers, unhorsed, and killed. Lord Stanley picked up 
the crown, all bruised and trampled, and stained with 
blood, and put it upon Richmond’s head, amid loud and 
rejoicing cries of “ Long live King Henry! ” 

That night, a horse was led up to the church of the Grey 
Friars at Leicester ; across whose back was tied, like some 
worthless sack, a naked body brought there for burial. It 
was the body of the last of the Plantagenet line, King 
Richard the Third, usurper and murderer, slain at the bat- 
tle of Bosworth Field in the thirty-second year of his age, 
after a reign of two years.

CHAPTER XXVI. 

\ 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SEVENTH. 

King Henry the Seventh did not turn out to be as 
fine a fellow as the nobility and people hoped, in the first 
joy of their deliverance from Richard the Third. He was 
very cold, crafty, and calculating, and would do almost 
anything for mone> He possessed considerable ability, 
but his chief merit appears to have been that he was not 
cruel when there was nothing to be got by it. 

The new King had promised the nobles who had espoused 
his cause that he would marry the Princess Elizabeth. 
The first thing he did, was, to direct her to be removed 
from the castle of Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire, where 
Richard had placed her, and restored to the care of her 
mother in London. The young Earl of Warwick, Edward 
Plantagenet, son and heir of the late Duke of Clarence, had 
been kept a prisoner in the same old Yorkshire Castle with 
her. This boy, who was now fifteen, the new King placed 
in the Tower for safety. Then he came to London in great 
state, and gratified the people with a fine procession ; on 
which kind of show he often very much relied for keeping 
them in good humour. The sports and feasts which took 
place were followed by a terrible fever, called the Sweating 
Sickness ; of which great numbers of people died. Lord 
Mayors and Aldermen are thought to have suffered most 
from it ; whether, because they were in the habit of over- 
eating themselves, or because they were very jealous of 
preserving filth and nuisances in the City (as they have been 
since), I don’t know. 

The King’s coronation was postponed on account of the 
general ill-health, and he afterwards deferred his marriage, 
as if he were not very anxious that it should take place : 
and, even after that, deferred the Queen’s coronation so 
long that he gave offence to the York party. However, he 
set these things right in the end, by hanging some men and 
seizing on the rich possessions of others ; by granting more 
popular pardons to the followers of the late King than 
could, at first, be got from him ; and, by employing about

his Court, some not very scrupulous persons who had been 
employed in the previous reign. , 

As this reign was principally remarkable for two very 
curious impostures which have become famous in history, 
we will make those two stories its principal features. 

There was a priest at Oxford of the name of Simons, 
who had for a pupil a handsome boy named Lambert Sim- 
nel, the son of a baker. Partly to gratify his own ambi- 
tious ends, and partly to carry out the designs of a secret 
party formed against the King, this priest declared that 
his pupil, the boy, - was no other than the young Earl 
of Warwick ; who (as everybody might have known) was 
safely locked up in the Tower of London. The priest and 
the boy went over to Ireland; and, at Dublin, enlisted in 
their cause all ranks of the people : who seem to have been 
generous enough, but exceedingly irrational. The Earl of 
Kildare, the governor of Ireland, declared that he believed 
the boy to be what the priest represented ; and the boy, 
who had been well tutored by the priest, tqld them such 
things of his childhood, and gave them so many descrip- 
tions of the Royal Family, that they were perpetually 
shouting and hurrahing, and drinking his health, and 
making all kinds of noisy and thirsty demonstrations, to 
express their belief in him. Nor was this feeling confined 
to Ireland alone, for the Earl of Lincoln — whom the late 
! usurper had named as his successor — went -over to the 
young Pretender; and, after holding a secret correspond- 
ence with the Dowager Duchess of Burgundy — the sister of 
Edward the Fourth, who detested -the present King and all 
his race — sailed to Dublin with two thousand German sol- 
diers of her providing. In this promising state of the 
boy’s fortunes, he was crowned there, with a crown taken 
off the head of a statue of the Virgin Mary; and was then, 
according to the Irish custom of those days, carried home 
on the shoulders of a big chieftain possessing a great’ deal 
more strength than sense. Father Simons, you may be 
sure, was mighty* busy at the coronation. 

Ten days afterwards, the Germans, and the Irish, and 
the priest, and the boy, and the Earl of Lincoln, all landed 
in Lancashire to invade England. The King, who had 
good intelligence of their movements, set up his standard 
at Nottingham, where vast numbers resorted to Him every 
day; while the Earl of Lincoln could gain but very few.

A CHILD'S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


With his small force he tried to make for the town of 
Newark; but the King's army getting between him and 
that place, he had no choice but to risk a battle at Stoke. 
It soon ended in the complete destruction of the Pretender's 
forces, one half of whom were killed; among them, the 
earl himself. The priest and the baker's boy were taken 
prisoners. The priest, after confessing the trick, was shut 
up in prison, where he afterwards died — suddenly perhaps. 
The boy was taken into the King's kitchen and made a 
turnspit. He was afterwards raised to the station of one 
of the King's falconers; and so ended this strange imposi- 
tion. 

There seems reason to suspect that the Dowager Queen 
—always a restless and busy woman— had had some share 
in tutoring the baker's son. The King was very angry 
with her, whether or no. He seized upon her property, 
and shut her up in a convent at Bermondsey. 

One might suppose that the end of this story would have 
put the Irish people on their guard ; but they were quite 
ready to receive a second impostor, as they had received 
the first, and that same troublesome Duchess of Burgundy 
soon gave them the opportunity. All of a sudden there 
appeared at Cork, in a vessel arriving from Portugal, a 
young man of excellent abilities, of very handsome appear- 
ance and most winning manners, who declared himself to 
be Richard, Duke of York, the second son of King Edward 
the Fourth. “ 0,” said some, even of those ready Irish 
believers, “ but surely that young Prince was murdered by 
his uncle in the Tower ! " — “ It is supposed so, " said the 
engaging young man ; “ and my brother was killed in that 
gloomy prison; but I escaped — it don't matter how, at 
present— and have been wandering about the world for 
seven long years." This explanation being quite satisfac- 
tory to numbers of the Irish people, they began again to 
shout and to hurrah, and to drink his health, and to make 
the noisy and thirsty demonstrations all over again. And 
the big chieftain in Dublin began to look out for another 
coronation, and another young King to be carried home on 
his back. 

Now, King Henry being then on bad terms with France, 
the French King, Charles the Eighth, saw that, by pretend- 
ing to believe in the handsome young man, he could trouble 
his enemy sorely. So, he invited him over to the French

Court, and appointed him a body-guard, and treated him 
in all Tespects as if he really were the Duke of York, 
Peace, however, being soon concluded between the two 
Kings, the pretended duke was turned adrift, and wan- 
dered for protection to the Duchess of Burgundy. She, 
after feigning to inquire into the reality of his claims, 
declared him to be the very picture of her dear departed 
brother; gave him a body-guard at her Court, of thirty 
halberdiers ; and called him by the sounding name of the 
White Rose of England. 

The leading members of the White Rose party in England 
sent over an agent, named Sir Robert Clifford, to ascertain 
whether the White Rose's claims were good : the King also 
sent over his agents to inquire into the Rose’s history. 
The White Roses declared the young man to be really the 
Duke of York; the King declared him to be Perkin War- 
beck, the son of a merchant of the city of Tournay, who 
had acquired his knowledge of England, its language and 
manners, from the English merchants who traded in Flan* 
ders; it was also stated by the Royal agents that he had 
been in the service of Lady Brompton, the wife of an exiled 
English nobleman, and that the Duchess of Burgundy had 
caused him to be trained and taught, expressly for this de- 
ception. The King then required the Archduke Philip — 
who was the sovereign of Burgundy — to banish this new 
Pretender, or to deliver him up ; but, as the archduke re- 
plied that he could not control the duchess in her own land, 
the King, iii revenge, took the market of English cloth 
away from Antwerp, and prevented all commercial inter- 
course between the two countries. 

He also, by arts and bribes, prevailed on Sir Robert 
Clifford to betray his employers ; and he denouncing sev- 
eral famous English noblemen as being secretly the friends 
of Perkin Warbeck, the King had three of the foremost 
executed at once. Whether he pardoned the remainder 
because they were poor, I do not know ; but it is only too 
probable that he refused to pardon one famous nobleman 
against whom the same Clifford soon afterwards informed 
separately, because he was rich. This was ho other than 
Sir William Stanley, who had saved the King's life at the 
battle of Bosworth Field. It is very doubtful whether his

would not take arms against him. Whatever he had done 
he admitted, like an honourable spirit; and he lost his 
head for it, and the covetous King gained all his wealth. 

Perkin Warbeck kept quiet for three years; but, as the 
Flemings began to complain heavily of the loss of their 
trade by the stoppage of the Antwerp market on his account, 
and as it was not unlikely that they might even go so far 
as to take his life, or give him up, he found it necessary 
to do something. Accordingly he made a desperate sally, 
and landed, with only a few hundred men, on the coast of 
Deal. But he was soon glad to get back to the place from 
whence he came ; for the country people rose against his 
followers, killed a great many, and took a hundred and 
fifty prisoners: who were all driven to London, tied to- 
gether with ropes, like a team of cattle. Every one of 
them was hanged on some part or other of the sea-shore ; 
in order, that if any more men should come over with Per- 
kin Warbeck, they might see the bodies as a warning be- 
fore they landed. 

Then the wary King, by making a treaty of commerce 
with the Flemings, drove Perkin Warbeck out of that 
country ; and, by completely gaining over the Irish to his 
side, deprived him of that asylum too. He wandered away 
to Scotland, and told his story at that Court. King James 
the Fourth of Scotland, who was no friend to King Henry, 
and had no reason to be (for King Henry had bribed his 
Scotch lords to betray him more than once ; but had never 
succeeded in his plots), gave him a great reception, called 
him his cousin, and gave him in marriage the Lady Cather- 
ine Gordon, a beautiful and charming creature related to 
the royal house of Stuart. 

Alarmed by this successful reappearance of the Pretend- 
er, the King still undermined, and bought, and bribed, 
and kept his doings and Perkin Warbeck's story in the 
dark, when he might, one would imagine, have rendered 
the matter clear to all England. But, for all this bribing 
of the Scotch lords at the Scotch King's Court, he could 
not procure the Pretender to be delivered up to him. 
James, though not very particular in many respects, would 
not betray him ; and the ever-busy Duchess of Burgundy 
so ' provided him with arms, and good soldiers, and with 
money besides, that he had soon a little army of fifteen 
hundred men of various nations. With these, and aided

by the Scottish King in person, he crossed the border into 
England, and made a proclamation to the people* in which 
he called the King “ Henry Tudor ” ; offered large rewards 
to any who should take or distress him; and announced 
himself as King Richard the Fourth come to receive the 
homage of his faithful subjects. His faithful subjects, 
however, cared nothing for him, and hated his faithful 
troops: Who, being of different nations, quarrelled also 
among themselves. Worse than this, if worse were possi- 
ble, they began to plunder the country ; upon which the 
White Rose said, that he would rather lose his rights, than 
gain; them through the miseries of the English people. 
The Scottish King made a jest of his scruples ; but they and 
their whole force went back again without fighting a battle. 

The worst consequence of this attempt was, that a rising 
took place among the people of Cornwall, who considered 
themselves too heavily taxed to meet the charges of the 
expected war. Stimulated by Flammock, a lawyer, and 
Joseph, a blacksmith, and joined by Lord Audley and some 
other country gentlemen, they marched on all the way 
to Deptford Bridge, where they fought, a battle ■ with the 
King’s army. They were defeated — though the Cornish 
men fought with great bravery— and the lord was beheaded^ 
and the lawyer and the blacksmith were hanged, drawn, 
and quartered. The rest were pardoned. The King, who 
believed every man to be as avarioious as himself, and 
thought that money could settle anything, allowed them to 
make bargains for their liberty with the soldiers who had 
taken them. 

Perkin Warbeck, doomed to wander up and down, and 
never to find rest any where-^a sad fate : almost a sufficient 
punishment for an imposture, which he seems in time to 
have half believed himself — lost liis Scottish refuge through 
a truce being made between the two kings ; and found him- 
self, once more, without a country before him in which he 
could lay his head. But James (always honourable and 
true to him, alike when he melted down his plate, and even 
the great gold chain he had been used to wear, to pay sol- 
diers in his cause; and now, when that cause was lost and 
hopeless) did not conclude the treaty, until he had safely 
departed out of the Scottish dominions. He, and his beau- 
tiful wife, who was faithful to him under all reverses, and 
left her state and home to follow his poor fortunes, were

put aboard ship with everything necessary for their com- 
fort and protection, and sailed for Ireland. 

But, the Irish people had had enough of counterfeit 
Earls of Warwick and Dukes of York, for one while; and 
would give the White Rose no aid. So, the White Rose- 
encircled by thorns indeed — resolved to go with his beauti- 
ful wife to Cornwall as a forlorn resource, and see what 
might be made of the Cornish men, who had risen so 
valiantly a little while before, and who had fought so 
bravely at Deptford Bridge. 

To Whitsand Bay, in Cornwall, accordingly, came Perkin 
Warbeck and his wife; and the lovely lady he shut up for 
safety in the Castle of Saint Michael’s Mount, and then 
marched into Devonshire at the head of three thousand 
Cornish men. These were increased to six thousand by 
the time of his arrival in Exeter; but, there the people 
made a stout resistance, and he went on to Taunton, where 
he came in sight of the King’s army. The stout Cornish 
men, although they were few in number, and badly armed, 
were so bold, that they never thought of retreating; but 
bravely looked forward to a battle on the morrow. Un- 
happily for them, the man who was possessed of so many 
engaging qualities, and who attracted so many people to his 
side when he had nothing else with which to tempt them, 
was not as brave as they. In the night, when the two 
armies lay opposite to each other, he mounted a swift horse 
and lied. When morning dawned, the poor confiding Cor- 
nish men, discovering that they had no leader, surrendered 
to the King’s power. Some of them were hanged, and the 
rest were pardoned and went miserably home. 

Before the King pursued Perkin Warbeck to the sanc- 
tuary of Beaulieu in the New Forest, where it was soon 
known that he had taken refuge, he sent a body of horse- 
men to Saint Michael’s Mount, to seize his wife. She was 
soon taken and brought as a captive before the King. But 
she was so beautiful, and so good, and so devoted to the 
man in whom she believed, that the King regarded her 
with compassion, treated her with great respect, and placed 
her at Court, near the Queen’s person. And many years 
after Perkin Warbeck was no more, and when his strange 
story had become like a nursery tale, she was called the 
White Rose, by the people, in remembrance of her beauty. 

The sanctuary at Beaulieu was soon surrounded by the

King's men ; and the King, pursuing his usual dark artful 
ways, sent pretended friends to Perkin Warbeck to per- 
suade him to come out and surrender himself. This he 
soon did ; the King having taken a good look at the man 
of whom he had heard so much — from behind a screen — 
directed him to be well mounted, and to ride behind him 
at a little distance, guarded, but not bound in any way. 
So they entered London with the King’s favourite show — 
a procession ; and some of the people hooted as the Pre- 
tender rode slowly through the streets to the Tower ; but 
the greater part were quiet, and very curious to see him. 
From the Tower, he was taken to the Palace at Westmin- 
ster, and there lodged like a gentleman, though closely 
watched. He was examined every now and then as to his 
imposture; but the King was so secret in all he did, that 
even then he gave it a consequence, which it cannot be 
supposed to have in itself deserved. 

At last Perkin Warbeck ran away, and took refuge in 
another sanctuary near Richmond in Surrey. From this 
he was again persuaded to deliver himself up ; and, being 
conveyed to London, he stood in the stocks for a whole 
day, outside Westminster Hall, and there read a paper 
purporting to be his full confession, and relating his his- 
tory as the King’ 8 agents had originally described it. He 
was then shut up in the Tower again, in the company of 
the Earl of Warwick, who had now been there for fourteen 
years: ever since his removal out of Yorkshire, except 
when the King had had him at Court, and had shown him 
to the people, to prove the imposture of the Baker’s boy. It 
is but too probable, when we consider the crafty character 
of Henry the Seventh, that these two were brought together 
for a cruel purpose. A plot was soon discovered between 
them and the keepers, to murder the Governor, get posses- 
sion of the keys, and proclaim Perkin Warbeck as King 
Richard the Fourth. That there was some such plot, is 
likely; that they were tempted into it, is at least as likely; 
that the unfortunate Earl of Warwick — last male of the 
Plantagenet line — was too unused to the world, and too 
ignorant and simple to know much about it, whatever it 
was, is perfectly certain; and that it was the King’s inter- 
est to get rid of him, is no less so. He was beheaded on 
Tower Hill, and Perkin Warbeck was hanged at Tyburn. 

Such was the end of the pretended Duke of York, wiw

shadowy history was made more shadowy — and ever will 
be— by the mystery and craft of the King. If he had 
turned his great natural advantages to a more honest 
account, he might have lived a happy and respected life, 
even in those days. But he died upon a gallows at Tyburn, 
leavihg the Scottish lady, who had loved him so well, 
kindly protected at the Queen’s Court. After some time 
she forgot her old loves and troubles, as many people do 
with Time’s merciful assistance, and married a Welsh gen- 
tleman. Her second husband, Sir Matthew Cradoc, 
more honest and more happy than her first, lies beside her 
in a tomb in the old church of Swansea. 

The ill-blood between France and England in this reign, 
arose out of the continued plotting of the Duchess of Bur- 
gundy, and disputes respecting the affairs of Brittany. 
The King feigned to be very patriotic, indignant, and war- 
like ; but ho always contrived so as never to make war in 
reality, and always to make money. His taxation of the 
people, on pretence of war with France, involved, at one 
time, a very dangerous insurrection, headed by Sir John 
Egremont, and a common man called John a Chamhre. 
But it was subdued by the royal forces, under the command 
of the Earl of Surrey. The knighted John escaped to the 
Duchess of Burgundy > who was ever ready to receive any 
one who gave the King trouble; and the plain John was 
hanged at York, in the midst of a number of his men, but 
on a much higher gibbet, as being a greater traitor. Hung 
high or hung low, however, hanging is much the same to 
the person hung. 

Within a year after her marriage, the Queen had given 
birth to a son, who was called Prince Arthur, in remem- 
brance of the old British prince of romance and story; 
and who, when all these events had happened, being then 
in his fifteenth year, was married to Catherine, the 
daughter of the Spanish monarch, with great rejoicings and 
bright prospects ; but in a very few months he sickened 
and died. As soon as the King had recovered from his 
grief, he thought it a pity that the fortune of the Spanish 
Princess, amounting to two hundred thousand crowns, 
should go out of the family ; and therefore arranged that 
the young widow should marry his second son Henry, then 
twelve years of age, when he too should be fifteen. There 
were objections to this marriage on the part of the clergy;

but, as the infallible Pope was gained over, and, as he 
must be right, that settled the business for the time. The 
King's eldest daughter was provided for, and a long course 
of disturbance was considered to be set at rest, by her being 
married to the Scottish King. * 

And now the Queen died. When the King got over 
that grief too, his mind once more reverted to his darling 
money for consolation, and he thought of marrying the 
Dowager Queen of Naples, who was immensely rich : but, 
as it turned out not to be practicable to gain the money, 
however practicable it might have been to gain the lady, 
he gave up the idea. He was not so fond of her but that 
he soon proposed to marry the Dowager Duchess of Savoy; 
and, soon afterwards, the widow of the. King of Castile, 
who was raving mad. But he made a money-bargain in- 
stead, and married neither. 

The Duchess of Burgundy, among the other discontented 
people to whom she had given refuge, had sheltered Edmund 
de la Pole (younger brother of that Earl of Lincoln who 
was killed at Stoke), now Earl of Suffolk. The King had 
prevailed upon him to return to the marriage of Prince 
Arthur; but, he soon afterwards went away again; and 
then the King, suspecting a conspiracy, resorted to his 
favourite plan of sending him some treacherous friends, and 
buying of those scoundrels the secrets they disclosed or 
invented. Some arrests and executions took place in con- 
sequence. In the end, the King, on a promise of not taking 
his life, obtained possession of the person of Edmund de 
la Pole, and shut him up in the Tower. 

This was his laBt enemy. If he had lived much longer 
he would have made many more among the people, by the 
grinding exaction to which he constantly exposed them, 
and by the tyrannical acts of his two prime favourites in 
all money-raising matters, Edmund Dudley and Richard 
Empson. But Death — the enemy who is not to be bought 
off or deceived, and on whom no money, and no treachery, 
has any effect — presented himself at this juncture, and 
ended the King’s reign. He died of the gout, on the 
twenty-second of April, one thousand five hundred and 
nine, and in the fifty-third year of his age, after reigning 
twenty-four years ; he was buried in the beautiful Chapel 
of Westminster Abbey, which he had himself founded, 
and which still bears his najfce. » - *

It was in this reign that the great Christopher Colum- 
bus, on behalf of Spain, discovered what was then called 
The New World. Great wonder, interest, and hope of 
wealth being awakened in England thereby, the King and 
the merchants of London and Bristol fitted out an English 
expedition for further discoveries in the New World, and 
entrusted it to Sebastian Cabot, of Bristol, the son of a 
Venetian pilot there. He was very successful in his voyage, 
and gained high reputation, both for himself and England. 


CHAPTER XXVII. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH, CALLED 
BLUFF KING HAL AND BURLY KING HARRY. 

PART THE PIR8T. 

We now come to King Henry the Eighth, whom it has 
been too much the fashion to call “ Bluff King Hal,” and 
“Burly King Harry,” and other fine names; but whom I 
shall take the liberty to call, plainly, one of the most 
detestable villains that ever drew breath. You will be 
able to judge, long before we come to the end of his life, 
whether he deserves the character. 

He was just eighteen years of age when he came to the 
throne. People said he was handsome then; but I don’t 
believe it. He was a big, burly, noisy, small-eyed, large- 
faced, double-chinned, swinish-looking fellow in later life 
(as we know from the likenesses of him, painted by the 
famous Hans Holbein), and it is not easy to believe that 
so bad a character can ever have been veiled under a pre- 
possessing appearance. 

He was anxious to make himself popular ; and the peo- 
ple, who had long disliked the late King, were very will- 
ing to believe that he deserved to be so. He was extremely 
fond of show and display, and so were they. Therefore 
there was great rejoicing when he married the Princess 
Catherine, and when they were both crowned. And the 
King fought at tournaments and always came off victorious 
—for the courtiers took care of that — and there was a gen-

eral outcry that he was a wonderful man. Empson, Dud- 
ley, and their supporters were accused of a variety of crimes 
they had never committed, instead of the offences of which 
they really had been guilty ; and they were pilloried, and 
set upon horses with their faces to the tails, and knocked 
about and beheaded, to the satisfaction of the people, and 
the enrichment of the King. 

The Pope, so indefatigable in getting the world into 
trouble, had mixed himself up in a war on the continent of 
Europe, occasioned by the reigning Princes of little quar- 
relling states in Italy having at various times married into 
other Royal families, and so led to their claiming a share in 
those petty Governments. The King, who discovered that 
he was very fond of the Pope, sent a herald to the King 
of France, to say that he must not make war upon that 
holy personage, because he was the father of all Christians. 
As the French King did not mind this relationship in the 
least, and also refused to admit a claim King Henry made 
to certain lands in France, war was declared between the 
two countries. Not to perplex this story with an account 
of the tricks and designs of all the sovereigns who were 
engaged in it, it is enough to say that England made a 
blundering alliance with Spain, and got stupidly taken in 
by that country ; which made its own terms with France 
when it could, and left England in the lurch. Sir Edward 
Howard, a bold admiral, son of the Earl of Surrey, dis- 
tinguished himself by his bravery against the French in 
this business ; but, unfortunately, he was more brave than 
wise, for, skimming into the French harbour of Brest with 
only a few row-boats, he attempted (in revenge for the de- 
feat and death of Sir Thomas Knyvett, another bold 
English admiral) to take some strong French ships, well 
defended with batteries of cannon. The upshot was, that 
he was left on board of one of them (in consequence of it 
shooting away from his own boat), with not more than 
about a dozen men, and was thrown into the sea and 
drowned : though not until he had taken from his breast 
his gold chain and gold whistle, which were the signs of 
his office, and had cast them into the sea to prevent their 
being made a boast of by the enemy. After this defeat — 
which was a great one, for Sir Edward Howard was a man 
of valour and fame — the King took it into his head to in- 
vade France in person; first executing that dangerous Earl

of Suffolk whom his father had left in the Tower, and ap* 
pointing Queen Catherine to the charge of his kingdom in 
his absence. He sailed to Calais, where he was joined by 
Maximilian, Emperor of Germany, who pretended to be 
his soldier, and who took pay in his service : with a good 
deal of nonsense of that sort, flattering enough to the 
vanity of a vain blusterer. The King might be successful 
enough in sham fights ; but his idea of real battles chiefly 
consisted in pitching silken tents of bright colours that 
were ignominiously blown down by the wind, and in mak- 
ing a vast display of gaudy flags and golden curtains 
Fortune, however, favoured him better than he deserved ; 
for, after much waste of time in tent pitching, flag flying, 
gold curtaining, and other such masquerading, he gave the 
French battle at a place called Guinegate : where they took 
such an unaccountable panic, and fled with such swiftness, 
that it was ever afterwards called by the English the Bat- 
tle of Spurs. Instead of following up his advantage, the 
King, finding that ho had had enough of real fighting, 
came home again. ' 

The Scottish King, though nearly related to Henry by 
marriage, had taken part against him in this war. The 
Earl of Surrey, as the English general, advanced to meet 
him when he came out of his own dominions and crossed 
the river Tweed. The two armies came up with one 
another when the Scottish King had also crossed the river 
Till, and was encamped upon the last of the Cheviot Hills, 
called the Hill of Flodden. Along the plain below it, the 
English, when the hour of battle came, advanced. The 
Scottish army, which had been drawn up in five great 
bodies, then came steadily down in perfect silence. So 
they, in their turn, advanced to meet the English army, 
which came on in one long line ; and they attacked it with 
a body of spearmen, under Lord Homb. At first they had 
the best of it; but the English recovered themselves so 
bravely, and fought with such valour, that, when the Scot- 
tish King had almost made his way up to the Royal stand- 
ard, he was slain, and the whole Scottish power routed. 
Ten thousand Scottish men lay dead that day on Flodden 
Field ; and among them, numbers of the nobility and gen- 
try. For a long time afterwards, the Scottish peasantry 
used to believe that their King had not been really killed 
in this battle, because no Englishman had found an iron

belt he wore about bis body as a penance for having been 
an unnatural and undutiful son. But, whatever became of 
his belt, the English had his sword aiid dagger, and the 
ring from his finger, and his body too, covered with wounds. 
There is no doubt of it ; for it was seen and recognised by 
English gentlemen who had known the Scottish King well. 

When King Henry was making ready to renew the war 
in France, the French King was contemplating peace. His 
queen, dying at this time, he proposed, though he was up- 
wards of fifty years old, to marry King Henry’s sister, the 
Princess Mary, who, besides being only sixteen, was be- 
trothed to the Duke of Suffolk. As the inclinations of 
young Princesses were not much considered in such mat- 
ters, the marriage was concluded, and the poor girl was es- 
corted to France, where she was immediately left as the 
French King’s bride, with only one of all her English 
attendants. That one was a pretty young girl named Anne 
Boleyn, niece of the Earl of Surrey, who had been made 
Duke of Norfolk, after the victory of Flodden Field. 
Anne Boleyn’s is a name to be remembered, as you will 
presently find. 

And now the French King, who was very proud of his 
young wife, was preparing for many years of happiness, 
and she was looking forward, I dare say, to many years of 
misery, when he died within three months, and left her a 
young widow. The new French monarch, Francis the 
First, seeing how important it was to his interests that she 
should take for her second husband no one but an English- 
man, advised her first lover, the Duke of Suffolk, when 
King Henry sent him over to Frahce to fetch her home, to 
marry her. The Princess being herself so fond of that 
Duke, as to tell him that he must either do so then, or for 
ever lose her, they were wedded ; and Henry afterwards 
forgave them. In making interest with the King, the 
Duke of Suffolk had addressed his most powerful favourite 
and adviser, Thomas Wolsey — a name very famous in 
history for its rise and downfall. 

Wolsey was the son of a respectable butcher at Ipswich, 
in Suffolk, and received so excellent an education that he 
became a tutor to the family of the Marquis of Dorset, who 
afterwards got him appointed one of the late King’s chap- 
lains. On the accession of Henry the Eighth, lie was 
promoted and taken into great favour. He was now

bishop of York; the Pope had made him a Cardinal bo* 
sides ; and whoever wanted influence in England or favour 
with the King — whether he were a foreign monarch or an 
English nobleman — was obliged to make a friend of the 
great Cardinal Wolsey. 

He was a gay man, who could dance and jest, and sing 
and drink ; and those were the roads to so much, or rather 
so little, of a heart as King Henry had. He was wonder- 
fully fond of pomp and glitter, and so was the King. He 
knew a good deal of the Church learning of that time ; 
much of which consisted in finding artful excuses and pre- 
tences for almost any wrong thing, and in arguing that 
black was white, or any other colour. This kind of learn- 
ing pleased the King too. For many such reasons, the 
Cardinal was high in estimation with the King; and, being 
a man of far greater ability, knew as well how to manage 
him, as a clever keeper may know how to manage a wolf or 
a tiger, or any other cruel and uncertain beast, that may 
turn upon him and tear him any day. Never had there 
been seen in England such state as my Lord Cardinal kept. 
His wealth was enormous; equal, it was reckoned, to the 
riches of the Crown. His palaces were as splendid as the 
King’s, and his retinue was eight hundred strong. He 
held his Court, dressed out from top to toe in flaming scar- 
let; and his very shoes were golden, set with precious 
stones. His followers rode on blood horses; while he, 
with a wonderful affectation of humility in the midst of 
his great splendour, ambled on a mule with a red velvet 
saddle and bridle and golden stirrups. 

Through the influence of this stately priest, a grand 
meeting was arranged to take place between the French 
and English Kings in France; but on ground belonging to 
England. A prodigious show of friendship and rejoicing 
was to be made on the occasion; and heralds were sent to 
proclaim with brazen trumpets through all the principal 
cities of Europe, that, on a certain day, the Kings of France 
and England, as companions and brothers in arms, each 
attended by eighteen followers, would hold a tournament 
against all knights who might choose to come. 

Charles, the new Emperor of Germany (the old one 
being dead), wanted to prevent too cordial an alliance be- 
tween these sovereigns, and came over to England before 
the King could repair to the place of meeting ; and, besides

making an agreeable impression upon him, secured Wol- 
sey’s interest by promising that his influence should make 
him Pope when the next vacancy occurred. On the day 
when the Emperor left England, the King and all the Court 
went over to Calais, and thence to the place of meeting, 
between Ardres and Guisnes, commonly called the Field of 
the Cloth of Gold. Here, all manner of expense and prodi- 
gality was lavished on the decorations of the show ; many 
of the knights and gentlemen being so superbly dressed 
that it was said they carried their whole estates upon their 
shoulders. 

There were sham castles, temporary chapels, fountains 
running wine, great cellars full of wine free as water to all 
comers, silk tents, gold lace and foil, gilt lions, and such 
things without end ; and, in the midst of all, the rich Car- 
dinal out-shone and out-glittered all the noblemen and gen- 
tlemen assembled. After a treaty made between the two 
Kings with as much solemnity as if they had intended to 
keep it, the lists — nine hundred feet long, and three hun- 
dred and twenty broad — were opened for the tournament ; 
the Queens of France and England looking on with great 
array of lords and ladies. Then, for ten days, the two 
sovereigns fought five combats every day, and always beat 
their polite adversaries; though they do write that the 
King of England, being thrown in a wrestle one day by the 
King of France, lost his kingly temper with his brother in 
arms, and wanted to make a quarrel of it. Then, there is 
a great story belonging to this Field of the Cloth of Gold, 
showing how the English were distrustful of the French, 
and the French of the English, until Francis rode alone 
one morning to Henry’s tent; and, going in before he was 
out of bed, told him in joke that he was his prisoner; and 
how Henry jumped out of bed and embraced Francis; and 
how Francis helped Henry to dress, and warmed his linen 
for him ; and how Henry gave Francis a splendid jewelled 
coUar, and how Francis gave Henry, in return, a costly 
bracelet. All this and a great deal more was so written 
about, and sung about, and talked about at that time (and, 
indeed, since that time too), that the world has had good 
cause to be sick of it, for ever. 

Of course, nothing came of all these fine doings but a 
speedy renewal of the war between England and France, 
in which the two Royal companions and brothers in arms

longed very earnestly to damage one another. But, before 
it broke out again, the Duke of Buckingham was shamefully 
executed on Tower Hill, on the evidence of a discharged 
servant — really for nothing, except the folly of having 
believed in a friar of the name of Hopkins, who had pre- 
tended to be a prophet, and who had mumbled and jum- 
bled out some nonsense about the Duke’s son being destined 
to be very great in the land. It was believed that the un- 
fortunate Duke had given offence to the great Cardinal by 
expressing his mind freely about the expense and absurdity 
of the whole business of the Field of the Cloth of Gold. 
At any rate, he was beheaded, as I have said, for nothing. 
And the people who saw it done were very angry, and cried 
out that it was the work of “ the butcher’s soul w 

The new war was a short one, though # the Earl of Surrey 
invaded France again, and did some injury to that country. 
It ended in another treaty of peace between the two king- 
doms, and in the discovery that the Emperor of Germany 
was not such a good friend to England in reality, as he pre- 
tended to be. Neither did he keep his promise to Wolsey 
to make him Pope, though the King urged him. Two 
Popes died in pretty quick succession; but the foreign 
priests were too much for the Cardinal, aiid kept him out 
of the post. So the Cardinal and King together found out 
that the Emperor of Germany was not a man to keep faith 
with; broke off a projected marriage between the King’s 
daughter Mary, Princess of Wales, and that sovereign; 
and began to consider whether it might not be well to 
marry the young lady, either to Francis himself, or to his 
eldest son. 

There now arose at Wittemberg, in Germany, the great 
leader of the mighty change in England which is called 
The Reformation, and which set the people free from their 
slavery to the priests. This was a learned doctor, named 
Martin Luther, who knew all about them, for he had 
been a priest, and even a monk, himself. The preaching 
and writing of Wickliffe had set a number of men thinking 
on this subject; and Luther, finding one day to his great 
surprise, that there really was a book called the New Tes- 
tament which the priests did not allow to be tead, and 
which contained truths that they suppressed, began to be 
very vigorous against the whole body, from the Pope down- 
ward. It happened, while he was yet only beginning his

vast work of awakening the nation, that an impudent fel- 
low named Tetzel, a friar of very bad character, came into 
liis neighborhood selling what were called Indulgences^, by 
wholesale, to raise money for beautifying the great Cathe? 
dral of Saint Peter’s, at Rome. Whoever bought air In- 
dulgence of the Pope was supposed to buy himself off from 
the punishment of Heaven for his offences. Luther told 
the people that these Indulgences were worthless bits of 
paper, before God, and that Tetzel and his masters were a 
ciew of impostors in selling them. 

The King and the Cardinal were mightily indignant a$ 
this presumption; and the King (with the help of Sir 
Thomas Mqre, a wise man, whom he afterwards repaid 
by striking off his head) even wrote a book about it, with 
which the Pope was so well pleased that he gave the King 
the title of Defender of the Faith. The King and the Car- 
dinal also issued flaming warnings to the people not to read 
Luther’s books, on pain of excommunication. But they 
did read them for all that; and the rumour of what was in 
them spread far and wide. 

When this great change was thus going on, the King 
began to show himself in his truest and worst colours^ 
Anne Boleyu, the pretty little girl who had gone abroad to 
France with his sister, was by this time grown up to be 
very beautiful, and was one of the ladies in attendance oi> 
Queen Catherine. Now, Queen Catherine was no longer 
young or handsome, and it is likely that she was not 
particularly good-tempered; having been always rather 
melancholy, and having been made more so by the deaths 
of four of her children when they were very young. So, 
the King fell in love with the fair Anne Boleyn, and said 
to himself, “ How can I be best rid of my own troublesome 
wife whom I am tired of, and marry Anne? ” 

You recollect that Queen Catherine had been the wife of 
Henry’s brother. What does the King do, after thinking 
it over, but calls his favourite priests about him, and saysj 
0! his mind is in such a dreadful state, and he is so fright- 
fully uneasy because he is afraid it was not lawful for him to 
marry the Queen ! Not one of those priests had the cour- 
age to hint that it was rather curious lie had never thought 
of that before, and that his mind seemed to have been in 
a tolerably jolly condition during a great many years, in 
which he certainly had not fretted himself thin ; but, they

all said, Ah ! that was very true, and it was a serious busi- 
ness ; and perhaps the best way to make it right, would be 
for his Majesty to be divorced! The King replied, Yes, 
he thought that would be the best way, certainly ; so they 
all went to work. 

If I were to relate to you the intrigues and plots that 
took place in the endeavour to get this divorce, you would 
think the History of England the most tiresome book in the 
world. So I shall say no more, than that after a vast deal 
of negotiation and evasion, the Pope issued a commission 
to Cardinal Wolsey and Cardinal Campeggio (whom he 
sent over from Italy for the purpose), to try the whole case 
in England. It is supposed — and I think with reason — 
that Wolsey was the Queen’s enemy, because she had re- 
proved him for his proud and gorgeous manner of life. 
Hut he did not at first know that the King wanted to marry 
Anne Boleyn ; and when he did know it, he even went 
down on his knees, in the endeavour to dissuade him. 

The Cardinals opened their court in the Convent of the 
Black Friars, near to where the bridge of that name in Lon- 
don now stands ; and the King and Queen, that they might 
be near it, took up their lodgings at the adjoining palace 
of Bridewell, of which nothing now remains but a bad 
prison. On the opening of the court, when the King and 
Queen were called on to appear, that poor ill-used lady, 
with a dignity and firmness and yet with a womanly affec- 
tion worthy to be always admired, went and kneeled at the 
King’s feet, and said that she had come, a stranger, to his 
dominions ; that she had been a good and true wife to him 
for twenty years ; and that she could acknowledge no power 
in those Cardinals to try whether she should be considered 
his wife after all that time, or should be put away. With 
that, she got up and left the court, and would never after- 
wards come back to it. 

The King pretended to be very much overcome, and said, 
0 ! my lords and gentlemen, what a good woman she was 
to be sure, and how delighted he would be to live with her 
unto death, but for that terrible uneasiness in his mind 
which was quite wearing him away ! So, the case went on, 
and there was nothing but talk for two months. Then 
Cardinal Campeggio, who, on behalf of the Pope, wanted 
nothing so much as delay, adjourned it for two more 
months \ and before that time was elapsed, the Pope him-

self adjourned it indefinitely, by requiring the King and 
Queen to come to Rome and have it tried there. But by 
good luck for the King, word was brought to him by some 
of his people, that they had happened to meet at supper, 
Thomas Cranmer, a learned Doctor of Cambridge, who 
had proposed to urge the Pope on, by referring the case to 
all the learned doctors and bishops, here and there and 
everywhere, and getting their opinions that the King’s mar- 
riage was unlawful. The King, who was now in a hurry 
to marry Anne Boleyn, thought this such a good idea, 
that he sent for Cranmer, post haste, and said to Lord 
Rochfort, Anne Boleyn’ s father, “Take this learned Doc- 
tor down to your country-house, and there let him have a 
good room for a study, and no end of books out of which to 
prove that I may marry your daughter.” Lord Rochfort, 
not at all reluctant, made the learned Doctor as comfortable 
as he could ; and the learned Doctor went to work to prove 
his case. All this time, the King and Anne Boleyn were 
writing letters to one another almost daily, full of im- 
patience to have the case settled ; and Anne Boleyn was 
showing herself (as I think) very worthy of the fate 
which afterwards befell her. 

It was bad for Cardinal Wolsey that he had left Cran- 
mer to render this help. It was worse for him that he had 
tried to dissuade the King from marrying Anne Boleyn. 
Such a servant as he, to such a master as Henry, would 
probably have fallen in any case ; but, between the hatred 
of the party of the Queen that was, and the hatred of the 
party of the Queen that was to be, he fell suddenly and 
heavily. Going down one day to the Court of Chancery, 
where he now presided, he was waited upon by the Dukes 
of Norfolk and Suffolk, who told him that they brought an 
order to him to resign that office, and to withdraw quietly 
to a house he had at Esher, in Surrey. The Cardinal re- 
fusing, they rode off to the King ; and next day came back 
with a letter from him, on reading which, the Cardinal sub- 
mitted. An inventory was made out of all the riches in his 
palace at York Place (now Whitehall), and he went sorrow- 
fully up the river, in his barge, to Putney. An abject man 
he was, in spite of his pride ; for being overtaken, riding out 
of that place towards Esher, by one of the King’s cham- 
berlains who brought him a kind message and a ring, he 
alighted from his mule, took off his cap, and kneeled down

in the dirt. His poor Fool, whom in his prosperous days 
he had always kept in his palace to entertain him, cut a 
far better figure than he ; for, when the Cardinal said to 
the chamberlain that he had nothing to send to his lord the 
King as a present, but that jester who was a most excellent 
one, it took six strong yeomen to remove the faithful fool 
from his master. 

The once proud Cardinal was soon further disgraced, and 
wrote the most abject letters to his vile sovereign ; who 
humbled him one day and encouraged him the next, accord- 
ing to his humour, imtil he was at last ordered to go and 
reside in his diocese of York. He said he was too poor ; 
but I don’t know how he made that out, for he took a hun- 
dred and sixty servants with him, and seventy-two cart- 
loads of furniture, food, and wiue. He remained in that 
part of the country for the best part of a year, and showed 
himself so improved by his misfortunes, and was so mild 
and so conciliating, that he won all hearts. And iudeed, 
even in his proud days, he had done some magnificent things 
for learning and education. At last, he was arrested for 
high treason ; and, coming slowly on his journey towards 
London, got as far as Leicester. Arriving at Leicester 
Abbey after dark, and very ill, he said — when the monks 
came out at the gate with lighted torches to perceive him — 
that he had come to lay his bones among them. He had 
indeed ; for he was taken to a bed, from which he never 
rose again. His last words were, “Had I but served God 
as diligently as I have served the King, He would not have 
given me over, in my grey hairs. Howbeit, this is my 
just reward for my pains and diligence, not regarding my 
service to God, but only my duty to my prince.” The 
news of his death was quickly carried to the King, who 
was amusing himself with archery in the garden of the 
magnificent Palace at Hampton Court, which that very 
Wolsey had presented to him. The greatest emotion his 
royal mind displayed at the loss of a servant so faithful 
and so ruined, was a particular desire to lay hold of fifteen 
hundred pounds which the Cardinal was reported to have 
hidden somewhere. 

The opinions concerning the divorce, of the learned doc- 
tors and bishops and others, being at last collected, and 
being generally in the King’s favour, were forwarded to 
the Pope, with an entreaty that he would now grant it.

The unfortunate Pope, who was a timid man, was half dis- 
tracted between his fear of his authority being set aside in 
Eugland if he did not do as he was asked, and his dread of 
offending the Emperor of Germany , who was Queen Cather- 
ine’s nephew. In this state of mind he still evaded and 
did nothing. Then, Thomas Cromwell, who had been one 
of Wolsey’s faithful attendants, and had remained so even 
in his decline, advised the King to take the matter into 
his own hands, and make himself the head of the whole 
Church. This, the King by various artful means, began to 
do ; but he recompensed the clergy by allowing them to 
bum as many people as they pleased, for holding Luther’s 
opinions. You must understand that Sir Thomas More, 
the wise man who had helped the King with his book, had 
been made Chancellor in Wolsey’s place. But, as he was 
truly attached to the Church as it was even in its abuses, 
he, in this state of things, resigned. 

Being now quite resolved to get rid of Queen Catherine, 
and to marry Anne Boleyn without more ado, the King 
made Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury, and directed 
Queen Catherine to leave the Court. She obeyed ; but re- 
plied that wherever she went, she was Queen of England 
still, and would remain so, to the last. The King then 
married Anne Boleyn privately; and the new Archbishop 
of Canterbury, within half a year, declared his marriage 
with Queen Catherine void, and crowned Anne Boleyn 
Queeu. 

She might have known that no good could ever come 
from such wrong, and that the corpulent brute who had 
been so faithless and so cruel to his first wife, cbuhl be 
more faithless and more cruel to his second. She might 
have known that, even when he was in love with her, he 
had been a mean and selfish coward, running away, like a 
frightened cur, from her society and her house, when a 
dangerous sickness broke out in it, and when she might 
easily have taken it and died, as several of the household 
did. But, Anne Boleyn arrived at all this knowledge too 
late, and bought it at a dear price. Her bad marriage with 
a worse man came to its natural eud. Its natural end was 
not, as we shall too soou see, a natural death for her.

CHAPTER XXVIII. 

ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH. 

PART THE SECOND. 

The Pope was thrown into a very angry state of mind 
when he heard of the King’s marriage, and fumed exceed- 
ingly. Many of the English monks and friars, seeing that 
their order was in danger, did the same ; some even declaimed 
against the King in church before his face, and were not to 
be stopped until he himself roared out “ Silence ! ” The 
King, not much the worse for this, took it pretty quietly; 
and was very glad when his Queen gave birth to a daughter, 
who was christened Elizabeth, and declared Princess of 
Wales as her sister Mary had already been. 

One of the most atrocious features of this reign was that 
Henry the Eighth was always trimming between the re- 
formed religion and the unreformed one ; so that the more 
he quarrelled with the Pope, the more of his own subjects 
he roasted alive for not holding the Pope’ s opinions. Thus, 
an unfortunate student named John Frith, and a poor 
simple tailor named Andrew Hewet who loved him very 
much, and said that whatever John Frith believed he be- 
lieved, were burnt in Smithfield — to show what a capital 
Christian the King was. 

But, these were speedily followed by two much greater 
victims, Sir Thomas More, and John Fisher, the Bishop of 
Rochester. The latter, who was a good and amiable old 
man, had committed no greater offence than believing 
in Elizabeth Barton, called the Maid of Kent — another of 
those ridiculous women who pretended to be inspired, and 
to make all sorts of heavenly revelations, though they in- 
deed uttered nothing but evil nonsense. For this offence — 
as it was pretended, but really for denying the King to be 
the supreme Head of the Church — he got into trouble, and 
was put in prison; but, even then, he might have been 
suffered to die naturally (short work having been made of 
executing the Kentish Maid and her principal followers), 
but that the Pope, to spite the King, resolved to make him

a cardinal. Upon that the King made a ferocious joke 
to the effect that the Pope might send Fisher a red haW- 
which is the way they make a cardinal — but he should have 
no head on which to wear it ; and he was tried with all 
unfairness and injustice, and sentenced to death. He died 
like a noble and virtuous old man, and left a worthy name 
behind him. The King supposed, I dare say, that Sir 
Thomas More would be frightened by this example 5 but, as 
he was not to be easily terrified, and, thoroughly believ- 
ing in the Pope* had made up his mind that the King was 
not the rightful Head of the Church, he positively refused 
to say that he was. For this crime he too was tried and 
sentenced, after having been in prison a whole year. 
When he was doomed to death, and came away from his 
trial with the edge of the executioner’s axe turned towards 
him — as was always done in those times when a state pris- 
oner came to that hopeless pass — he bore it quite serenely, 
and gave his blessing to his son, who pressed through the 
crowd in Westminster Hall and kneeled down to receive it. 
But, when he got to the Tower Wharf on his way back to 
his prison, and his favorite daughter, Margaret Roper, 
a very good woman, rushed through the guards again and 
again, to kiss him and to weep upon his neck, he was over- 
come at last. He soon recovered, and never more showed 
any feeling but cheerfulness and courage. When he was 
going up the steps of the scaffold to his death, he said jok-, 
ingly to the Lieutenant of the Tower, observing that they 
were weak and shook beneath -his tread, “ I pray you, mas- 
ter Lieutenant, see me safe up ; and, for my coming down, 
I can shift for myself.” Also he said to the executioner, 
after he had laid his head upon the block, “ Let me put my 
beard out of the way ; for that, at least, has never com- 
mitted any treason.” Then his head was struck off at ,a 
blow. These two executions were worthy of King Henry 
the Eighth. Sir Thomas More was one of tho most virtu- 
ous men in his dominions, and the Bishop was one of his 
oldest and truest friends. But to be a friend of that fel- 
low was almost as dangerous as to be his wife. 

When the news of these two murders got to Rome, 
the Pope raged against the murderer more than ever Pope 
raged since the world began, and prepared a Bull, ordering 
his subjects to take arms against him and dethrone him. 
The King took all possible precautions to keep that docu-

ment out of his dominions, and set to work in return to 
suppress a great number of the English monasteries and 
abbeys. 

This destruction was begun by a body of commissioners, 
of whom Cromwell (whom the King had taken into great 
favour) was the head ; and was carried on through some 
few years to its entire completion. There is no doubt that 
many of these religious establishments were religious in 
nothing but in name, and were crammed with lazy, indo- 
lent, and sensual monks. There is no doubt that they im- 
posed upon the people in every possible way ; that they had 
images moved by wires, which they pretended were mirac- 
ulously moved by Heaven; that they had among them 
a whole tun measure full of teeth, all purporting to have 
come out of the head of one saint, who must indeed have 
been a very extraordinary person with that enormous allow- 
ance of grinders ; that they had bits of coal which they 
said had fried Saint Lawrence, and bits of toe-nails which 
they said belonged to other famous saints ; penknives, and 
boots, and girdles, which they said belonged to others ; and 
that all these bits of rubbish were called Relics, and adored 
by the ignorant people. But, on the other hand, there is 
no doubt either, that the King’s officers and men punished 
the good monks with the bad; did great injustice; demol- 
ished many beautiful things and many valuable libraries ; 
destroyed numbers of paintings, stained glass windows, fine 
pavements, and carvings; and that the whole court were 
ravenously greedy and rapacious for the division of this 
great spoil among them. The King seems to have grown 
almost mad in the ardour of this pursuit ; for he declared 
Thomas & Becket a traitor, though he had been dead so 
many years, and had his body dug up out of his grave. He 
must have been as miraculous as the monks pretended, if 
they had told the truth, for he was found with one head on 
his shoulders, and they had shown another as his undoubted 
and genuine head ever since his death; it had brought them 
vast sums of money, too. The gold and jewels on his shrine 
filled two great chests, and eight men tottered as they car- 
ried them away. How rich the monasteries were you may 
infer from the fact that, when they were all suppressed, 
one hundred and thirty thousand pounds a year — in those 
days an immense sum — came to the Crown. 

These things were not done without causing great dis*

content among the people. The monka had been good land’ 
lords and hospitable entertainers of all travellers, and had 
been accustomed to give away a great deal of com, and 
fruit, and meat, and other things. In those days it was 
difficult to change goods into money, in consequence of the 
roads being very few and very bad, and the carts and wag- 
gons of the worst description; and they must either. have 
given away some of the good things they possessed in enor- 
mous quantities, or have suffered them to spoil and moul- 
der. So, many of the people missed what it was more 
agreeable to get idly than to work for; and the monks who 
were driven out of their homes and wandered about encour- 
aged their discontent ; and there were, consequently, great 
risings in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. These were put 
down by terrific executions, from which the monks them w 
selves did not escape, and the King went on grunting and 
growling in his own fat way, like a Royal pig. 

I have told all this story of the religious houses at one 
time, to make it plainer, and to get back to the King's 
domestic affairs. 

The unfortunate Queen Catherine was by this time dead ; 
and the King was by this time as tired of his second Queen 
as he had been of his first. As he had fallen in love with 
Anne when she was in the service of Catherine, so he now 
fell in love with another lady in the service of Anne. See 
how wicked deeds are punished, and how bitterly and self- 
reproachfully the Queen must now have thought of her own 
rise to the throne ! The new fancy was a Lady J anb Sey- 
mour ; and the King no sooner set his mind on her, than 
he resolved to have Anne Boleyn's head. So, he brought 
a number of charges against Anne, accusing her of dreadful 
crimes which she had never committed, and implicating in 
them her own brother and certain gentlemen in her service : 
among whom one Norris, and Mark Smeaton a musician, 
are best remembered. As the lords and councillors were 
as afraid of the King and as subservient to him as the 
meanest peasant in England was, ‘they brought in Anne 
Boleyn guilty, and the other unfortunate persons accused 
with her, guilty too. Those gentlemen died like men, with 
the exception of Smeaton, who had been tempted by the 
King into telling lies, which he called confessions, and who 
had expected to be pardoned ; but who, I am very glad to 
say, was not. There was then only the Queen to dispose

of* She had been surrounded in the Tower with women 
spies; had been monstrously persecuted and foully slan- 
dered ; and had received no justice. But her spirit rose 
with her afflictions ; and, after having in vain tried to soften 
the King by writing an affecting letter to him which still 
exists, “ from her doleful prison in the Tower,” she resigned 
herself to death. She said to those about her, very cheer- 
fully, that she had heard say the executioner was a good 
one, and that she had a little neck (she laughed and clasped 
it with her hands as she said that), and would soon be out of 
her pain. And she was soon out of her pain, poor creature, 
on the Green inside the Tower, and her body was flung into 
an old box and put away in the ground under the chapel. 

There is a story that the King sat in his palace listening 
very anxiously for the sound of the cannon which was to 
announce this new murder; and that, when he heard it 
come booming on the air, he rose up in great spirits and 
ordered out his dogs to go a-hunting. He was bad enough 
to do it ; but whether he did it or not, it is certain that he 
married Jane Seymour the very next day. 

I have not much pleasure in recording that she lived 
just long enough to give birth to a son who was christened 
Edward, and then to die of a fever: for, I cannot but 
think that any woman who married such a ruffian, and 
knew what innocent blood was on his hands, deserved the 
axe that would assuredly have fallen on the neck of Jane 
Seymour, if she had lived much longer. 

Cranmer had done what he could to save some of the 
Church property for purposes of religion and education ; 
but, the great families had been so hungry to get hold of 
it, that very little could be rescued for such objects. Even 
Miles Coverdale, who did the people the inestimable ser- 
vice of translating the Bible into English (which the unre- 
formed religion never permitted to be done), was left in 
poverty while the great families clutched the Church lands 
and money. The people had been told that when the 
Crown came into possession of these funds, it would not be 
necessary to tax them ; but they were taxed afresh directly 
afterwards. It was fortunate for them, indeed, that so 
many nobles were so greedy for this wealth ; since, if it 
had remained with the Crown, there might have been no 
end to tyranny for hundreds of years One of the most 
active writers on the Church’s side against the King was a

member of his own family — a sort of distant cousin, Regi- 
nald Pole by name — who attacked him in the most violent 
manner (though he received a pension from him all the 
time), and fought for the Church with his pen, day and 
night. As he was beyond the King’s reach — being in Italy 
— the King politely invited him over to discuss the subject; 
but he, knowing better than to come, and wisely staying 
where he was, the King’s rage fell upon his brother Lord 
Montague, the Marquis of Exeter, and some other gentle- 
men: who were tried for high treason in corresponding 
with him and aiding him — which they probably did — and 
were all executed. The Pope made Reginald Pole a cardi- 
nal ; but, so much against his will, that it is thought he 
even aspired in his own mind to the vacant throne of Eng- 
land, and had hopes of marrying the Princess Mary. His 
being made a high priest, however, put an end to all that. 
His mother, the venerable Countess of Salisbury— who 
was, unfortunately for herself, within the tyrant’s reach 
— was the last of his relatives on whom his wrath fell. 
When she was told to lay her grey head upon the block, 
she answered the executioner, “No! My head never com- 
mitted treason, and if you want it, you shall seize it.’? So, 
she ran round and round * the scaffold with the exe- 
cutioner striking at her, and her grey hair bedabbled with 
blood ; and even when they held her down upon the block 
she moved her head about to the last, resolved to be no 
party to her own barbarous murder. All this the people 
bore, as they had borne everything else. 

Indeed they bore much more ; for the slow fires of Smith- 
field were continually burning, and people were constantly 
being roasted to death — still to show what a good Chris- 
tian the King was. He defied the Pope and his Bull, which 
was now issued, and had come into England ; but he burned 
innumerable people whose only offence was that they 
differed from the Pope’s religious opinions. There was a 
wretched man named Lambert, among others, who was 
tried for this before the King, and with whom six bishops 
argued one after another. When he was quite exhausted 
(as well he might be, after six bishops), he threw himself 
on the King’s mercy; but the King blustered out that he 
had no mercy for heretics. So, he too fed the fire. 

All this the people bore, and more than all this yet. 
The national spirit seems to have been banished from the

kingdom at this time. The very people who were executed 
for treason, the very wives and friends of the “bluff” 
King, spoke of him on the scaffold as a good prince, and a 
gentle prince — just as serfs in similar circumstances have 
been known to do, under the Sultan and Bashaws of the 
East, or under the fierce old tyrants of Russia, who poured 
boiling and freezing water on them alternately, until they 
died. The Parliament were as bad as the rest, and gave 
the King whatever he wanted ; among other vile accommo- 
dations, they gave him new powers of murdering, at his 
will and pleasure, any one whom he might choose to call a 
traitor. But the worst measure they passed was an Act of 
Six Articles, commonly called at the time “ the whip with 
six strings ; ” which punished offences against the Pope’s 
opinions, without mercy, and enforced the veiy worst parts 
of the monkish religion. Cranmer would have modified 
it, if he could ; but, being overborne by the Romish party, 
had not the power. As one of the articles declared that 
priests should not marry, and as he was married himself, 
he sent his wife and children into Germany, and began 
to tremble at his danger ; none the less because he was, 
and had long been, the King’s friend. This whip of six 
strings was made under the King’s own eye. It should 
never be forgotten of him how cruelly he supported the 
worst of the Popish doctrines when there was nothing to 
be got by opposing them. 

This amiable monarch now thought of taking another 
wife. He proposed to the French King to have some of 
the ladies of the French Court exhibited before him, that 
he might make his Royal choice ; but the French King an- 
swered that he would rather not have his ladies trotted out 
to be shown like horses at a fair. He proposed to the 
Dowager Duchess of Milan, who replied that she might 
have thought of such a match if she had had two heads ; 
but, that only owning one, she must beg to keep it safe. 
At last Cromwell represented that there was a Protestant 
Princess in Germany — those who held the reformed religiou 
were called Protestants, because their leaders had Protested 
against the abuses and impositions of the unreformed 
Church — named Anne of Cleves, who was beautiful, and 
would answer the purpose admirably. The King said was 
she a large woman, because he must have a fat wife? “ O 
yes,” said Cromwell; “ she was very large, just the thing.”

On hearing this the King sent over his famous painter, 
Hans Holbein, to take her portrait. Hans made her out 
to be so good-looking that the King was satisfied, and the 
marriage was arranged. But, whether anybody had paid 
Hans to touch up the picture ; or whether Hans, like one 
or two other painters, flattered a princess in the ordinary 
way of business, I cannot say : all I know is, that when Annie 
came over and the King went to Rochester to meet her, and 
first saw her without her seeing him, he swore she was “a 
great Flanders mare,” and said he would never marry her. 
Being obliged to do it now matters had gone so far, he 
would not give her the presents he had prepared, and would 
never notice her. He never forgave Cromwell his part in 
the affair. His downfall dates from that time. 

It was quickened by his enemies, in the interests of the 
unreformed religion, putting in the King’s way, at a state 
dinner, a niece of the Duke of Norfolk, Catherine How- 
ard, a young lady of fascinating manners, though small in 
stature and not particularly beautiful. Falling in love 
with her on the spot, the King soon divorced Anne of 
Cleves after making her the subject of much brutal talk, 
on pretence that she had been previously betrothed to some 
one else — which would never do for one of his dignity— 
and married Catherine. It is probable that on his wedding 
day, of all days in the year, he sent his faithful Cromwell 
to the scaffold, and had his head struck off. He further 
celebrated the occasion by burning at one time, and causing 
to be drawn to the fire on the same hurdles, some Protes* 
tant prisoners for denying the Pope’s doctrines, and some 
Roman Catholics prisoners for denying his own supremacy; 
Still the people bore it, and not a gentleman in England 
raised his hand. 

But, a just retribution, it soon came out that Catherr 
ine Howard, before her marriage, had been really guilty of 
such crimes as the King had falsely attributed “to his second 
wife Anne Boleyn ; so, again the dreadful axe made the King 
a widower, and this Queen passed away as to many in that 
reign had passed away before her. As an appropriate -purt 
suit under the circumstances, Henry then applied himself 
to superintending the composition of a religious book 
called “ A necessary doctrine for any Christian Man.** He 
must have been a little confused in his mind, I think, at 
about this period; for he was so false to himself to P

true to some one : that some one being Cranmer, whom the 
Duke of Norfolk and others of his enemies tried to ruin ; 
but to whom the King was steadfast, and to whom he one 
night gave his ring, charging him when he should find him- 
self, next day, accused of treason, to show it to the council 
board. This Cranmer did to the confusion of his enemies. 
I suppose the King thought he might want him a little longer. 

He married yet once more. Yes, strange to say, he 
found in England another woman who would become his 
wife, and she was Catherine Parr, widow of Lord Lati- 
mer. She leaned towards the reformed religion ; and it is 
some comfort to know, that she tormented the King con- 
siderably by arguing a variety of dootrinal points with him 
on all possible occasions. She had very nearly done this to 
her own destruction. After one of these conversations the 
King in a very black mood actually instructed Gardiner, 
one of his bishops who favoured the Popish opinions, to 
draw a bill of accusation against her, which would have in- 
evitably brought her to the scaffold where her predecessors 
had died, but that one of her friends picked up the paper 
of instructions which had been dropped in the palace, and 
gave her timely notice. She fell ill with terror; but man- 
aged the King so well when he came to entrap her into 
further statements — by saying that she had only spoken on 
such points to divert his mind and to get some information 
from his extraordinary wisdom — that he gave her a kiss 
and called her his sweetheart. And, when the Chaucellor 
came next day actually to take her to the Tower, the King 
sent him about his business, and honoured him with the 
epithets of a beast, a knave, and a fool. So near was 
Catherine Parr to the block, and so narrow was her escape ! 

There was war with Scotland in this reign, and a short 
clumsy war with Franoe for favouring Scotland ; shut, the 
events at home were so dreadful, and leave such an endur- 
ing stain on the country, that I need say no more of what 
happened abroad. 

A few more horrors, and this reign is over. There was 
a lady, Anne Askew, in Lincolnshire, who inclined to 
the Protestant opinions, and whose husband being a fierce 
Catholic, turned her out of his house. She came to Lon- 
don, and was considered as offending against the six arti- 
cles, and was taken to the Tower, and put upon the rack — 
probably beoause it was hoped that she might, in her agony,

criminate some obnoxious persons ; if falsely, so much the 
better. She was tortured without uttering a cry, until the 
Lieutenant of the Tower would suffer his men to torture 
her no more ; and then two priests who were present actu- 
ally pulled off their robes, and turned the wheels of the 
rack with their own hands, so rending and twisting and 
breaking her that she was afterwards carried to the fire in 
a chair. She was burned with three others, a gentleman, 
a clergyman, and a tailor ; and so the world went on. 

Either the King became afraid of the power of the Duke 
of Norfolk, and his son the Earl of Surrey, or they gave 
him some offence, but he resolved to pull them down, to 
follow all the rest who were gone. The son was tried first 
— of course for nothing — and defended himself bravely 5 but 
of course he was found guilty, and of course he was Execut- 
ed. Then hia father was laid hold of, and left for death too. 

But the King himself was left for death by a Greater 
King, and the earth was to be rid of him at last. He was 
now a swollen, hideous spectacle, with a great hole in his 
leg, and so odious to every sense that it was dreadful to ap- 
proach him. When he was found to be dying, Cranmer 
was sent for from his palace at Croydon, and came with all 
speed, but found him speechless. Happily, in that hour 
he perished. He was in the fifty-sixth year of his age, 
and the thirty-eighth of his reign. 

Henry the Eighth has been favoured by some Protestant 
writers, because the Reformation was achieved in his time. 
But the mighty merit of it lies with other men and not 
with him ; and it can be rendered none the worse by this 
monster’s crimes, and none the better by any defence of 
them. The plain truth is, that he was a most intolerable 
ruffian, a disgrace to human nature, and a blot of blood 
and grease upon the History of England.

A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 


CHAPTER XXIX. 

ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SIXTR 

Henry the Eighth had made a will, appointing a Coun- 
cil of sixteen to govern the kingdom for his son while lie 
was under age (he was now only ten years old), and another 
Council of twelve to help them. The most powerful of 
the first Council was the Earl of Hertford, the young 
King's uncle, who lost no time in bringing his nephew with 
great state up to Enfield, and thence to the Tower. It was 
considered at the time a striking proof of virtue in the 
young King that he was sorry for his father's death; but, 
as common subjects have that virtue too, sometimes, we 
will say no more about it. 

There was a cuiious part of the late King’s will, requir- 
ing his executors to fulfil whatever promises he had made. 
Some of the Court wondering what these might be, the Earl 
of Hertford and the other noblemen interested, said that 
they were promises to advance and enrich them . So, the 
Earl of Hertford made himself Duke of Somerset, and 
made his brother Edward Seymour a barofi; and there 
were various similar promotions, all very agreeable to 
the parties concerned, and very dutiful, no doubt, to the 
late King's memory. To be more dutiful still, they made 
themselves rich out of the Church lands, and were very 
comfortable. The new Duke of Somerset caused himself 
to be declared Protector of the kingdom, and was, indeed, 
the King. 

As young Edward the Sixth had been brought up in the 
principles of the Protestant religion, everybody knew that 
they would be maintained. But Cranmer, to whom they 
were chiefly entrusted, advanced them steadily and tem- 
perately. Many superstitious and ridiculous practices were 
stopped ; but practices which were harmless were not inter- 
fered with. 

The Duke of Somerset, the Protector, was anxious to 
have the young King engaged in marriage to the young 
Queen of Scotland, in order to prevent that princess from 
making an alliance with any foreign power ; but, as a large

party in Scotland were unfavourable to this plan, he hi* 
vaded that country. His excuse for doing so was, that the 
Border men — that is, the Scotch who lived in that part of 
the country where England and Scotland joined — troubled 
the English very mucin But there were two sides to this 
question ; for the English Border men troubled the Scotch 
too ; and, through many long years, there were perpetual 
border quarrels which gave rise to numbers of old tales and 
songs. However, the Protector invaded Scotland; and 
Arran, the Scottish Regent, with an army twice as large 
as his, advanced to meet him. They encountered on the 
banks of the river Esk, within a few miles of Edinburgh ; 
and there, afteT a little skirmish, the Protector made such 
moderate proposals, in offering to retire if the Scotch would 
only engage not to marry their princess to any foreign 
prince, that the Regent thought the English were afraid. 
But in this he made a horrible mistake ; for the English 
soldiers on land, and the English sailors on the water, so 
set upon the Scotch, that they broke and fled, and more 
than ten thousand of them were killed. It was a dreadful 
battle, for the fugitives were slain without mercy. The 
ground for four miles, all the way to Edinburgh, was 
strewn with dead men, and with arms, and legs, and heads. 
Some hid themselves in streams and were drowned ; some 
threw away their armour and were killed running, almost 
naked; but in this battle of Pinkey the English lost only 
two or three hundred men. They were much better clothed 
than the Scotch; at the poverty of whose appearance and 
country they were exceedingly astonished. 

A Parliament was called when Somerset came back, and 
it repealed the whip with six strings, and did one or two 
other good things ; though it unhappily retained the pun- 
ishment of burning for those people who did not make 
believe to believe, in all religious matters, what the Govern- 
ment had declared that they tnust and should believe. It 
also made a foolish law (meant to put down beggars), that 
any man who lived idly and loitered . about for three days 
together, should be burned with a hot iron, made a slave, 
and wear an iron fetter. But this savage absurdity soon 
came to an end, and went the way of a great many other 
foolish laws. 

The Protector was now so proud that he sat in Parlia- 
ment before all the nobles, ou the right hand of the throne.

Many other noblemen, who only wanted to be as proud if 
they could get a chance, became his enemies of course ; and 
it is supposed that he came back suddenly from Scotland 
because he had received news that his brother, Lord Sey- 
mour, was becoming dangerous to him. This lord was 
now High Admiral of England; a very handsome man, 
and a great favourite with the Court ladies — even with the 
young Princess Elizabeth, who romped with him a little 
more than young princesses in these times do with any one. 
He had married Catherine Parr, the late King’s widow, 
who was now dead; and, to strengthen his power, he se- 
cretly supplied the young King with money. He may even 
have engaged with some of his brother’s enemies in a plot 
to carry the boy off. On these and other accusations, at 
any rate, he was confined in the Tower, impeached, and 
found guilty; his own brother’s name being — unnatural 
and sad to tell — the first signed to the warrant for his exe- 
cution. He was executed on Tower Hill, and died deny- 
ing his treason. One of his last proceedings in this world 
was to write two letters, one to the Princess Elizabeth, 
and one to the Princess Mary, which a servant of his took 
charge of, and concealed in his shoe. These letters are 
supposed to have urged them against his brother, and to 
revenge his death. What they truly contained is not 
known ; but there is no doubt that he had, at one time, 
obtained great influence over the Princess Elizabeth. 

All this while, the Protestant religion was making prog- 
ress. The images which the people had gradually come 
to worship, were removed from the churches ; the people 
were informed that they need not confess themselves to 
priests unless they chose; a common prayer-book was 
drawn up in the English language, which all could under- 
stand; and many other improvements were made; still 
moderately. For Cranmer was a very moderate man, and 
even restrained the Protestant clergy from violently abus- 
ing the unreformed religion — as they very often did, and 
which was not a good example. But the people were at 
this time in great distress. The rapacious nobility who 
had come into possession of the Church lands, were very 
bad landlords. They enclosed great quantities of ground 
for the feeding of sheep, which was then more profitable 
than the growing of crops ; and this increased the general 
distress. So the people, who still understood little of

' nt was going on about them, and still readily believed 
.at the homeless monks told them — many of whom had 
*eu their good friends in their better days — took it into 
: neu- heads that all this was owing to the reformed religion, 
ami therefore rose in many parts of the country. 

The most powerful risings were in Devonshire and Nor- 
iolk. In Devonshire, the rebellion was so strong that ten 
thousand men united within a few days, and even laid siege 
to Exeter. But Lord Russell, coming to the assistance 
of the citizens who defended that town, defeated the rebels ; 
and, not only hanged the Mayor of one place, but hanged 
the vicar of another from his own church steeple. What 
with hanging and killing by the sword, four thousand of 
the rebels are supposed to have fallen in that one county. 
In Norfolk (where the rising was more against the enclos- 
ure of open lands than against the reformed religion), the 
popular leader was a man named Robert Ket, a tanner of 
Wymondham. The mob were, in the first instance, excited 
against the tanner by one John Flowerdew, a gentleman 
who owed him a grudge: but the tanner was more than a 
match for the gentleman, since he soon got the people on 
his side, and established himself near Norwich with quite 
an army. There was a large oak-tree in that place, on a 
spot called Moushold Hill, which Ket named the Tree of 
Reformation ; and under its green boughs, he and his men 
sat, in the midsummer weather, holding courts of justice, 
and debating affairs of state. They were even impartial 
enough to allow some rather tiresome public speakers to 
get up into this Tree of Reformation, and point out their 
errors to them, in long discourses, while they lay listening 
(not always without some grumbling and growling) in the 
shade below. At last, one sunny July day, a herald ap- 
peared below the tree, and proclaimed Ket and all his men 
traitors, unless from that moment they dispersed and went 
home : in which case they were to receive a pardon. But, 
Ket and his men made light of the herald and became 
stronger than ever, until the Earl of Warwick went after 
them with a sufficient force, and cut them all to pieces. 
A few were hanged, drawn, and quartered, as traitors, and 
their limbs were sent into various country places to be a 
terror to the people. Nine of them were hanged upon nine 
green branches of the Oak of Reformation $ and so, for the 
time, that tree may be said to have withered away.

The Protector, though a haughty man, had compassion 
for the real distresses of the common people, and a sincere 
desire to help them. But he was too proud and too high 
in degree to hold even their favour steadily ; and many of 
the nobles always envied and hated him, because they were 
as proud and not as high as he. He was at this time build- 
ing a great Palace in the Strand : to get the stone for which 
he blew up church steeples with gunpowder, and pulled 
down bishops’ houses : thus making himself still more dis- 
liked. At length, his principal enemy, the Earl of War- 
wick — Dudley by name, and the son of that Dudley who 
had made himself so odious with Empson, in the reign of 
Henry the Seventh — joined with seven other members of 
the Council against him, formed a separate Council ; and, 
becoming stronger in a few days, sent him to the Tower 
under twenty-nine articles of accusation. After being sen- 
tenced by the Council to the forfeiture of all his offices and 
lands, he was liberated and pardoned, on making a veiy 
humble submission. He was even taken back into the 
Council again, after having suffered this fall, and married 
his daughter, Lady Anne Seymour, to Warwick’s eldest 
son. But such a reconciliation was little likely to last, and 
did not outlive a year. Warwick, having got himself made 
Duke of Northumberland, aiid having advanced the more 
important of his friends, then finished the history by caus- 
ing the Duke of Somerset and his friend Lord Grey, aud 
others, to be arrested for treason, in having conspired to 
seize and dethrone the King. They were also accused 
of having intended to seize the new Duke of Northumber- 
land, with his friends Lord Northampton and Lord Pem- 
broke ; to murder them if they found need ; and to raise 
the City to revolt. All this the fallen Protector positively 
denied ; except that he confessed to having spoken of the 
murder of those three noblemen, but having never designed 
it. He was acquitted of the charge of treason, and found 
guilty of the other charges ; so when the people — who re- 
membered his having been their friend, now that he was 
disgraced and in danger, saw him come out from his trial 
with the axe turned from him — they thought he was alto- 
gether acquitted, and set up a loud shout of joy. 

But the Duke of Somerset was ordered to be beheaded 
on Tower Hill, at eight o’clock in the morning, and proc- 
lamations were issued bidding the citizens keep at home

until after ten. They filled the streets, however, and 
crowded the place of execution as soon as it was light ; 
and, with sad faces and sad hearts, saw the once powerful 
Protector ascend the scaffold to lay his head upon the 
dreadful block. While he was yet saying his last words 
to them with manly courage, and telling them, in particu- 
lar, how it comforted him, at that pass, to have assisted in 
reforming the national religion, a member of the Council 
was seen riding up on horseback. They again thought 
that the Duke was saved by his bringing a reprieve, and 
again shouted for joy. But the Duke himself told them 
they were mistaken, and laid down his head and had it 
struck off at a blow. 

Many of the bystanders rushed forward and steeped their 
handkerchiefs in his blood, as a mark of their affection. 
He had, indeed, been capable of many good acts, and one 
of them was discovered after he was no more. The Bishop 
of Durham, a very good man, had been informed against 
to the Council, when the Duke was in power, as having 
answered a treacherous letter proposing a rebellion against 
the reformed religion. As the answer could not be found, 
he could not be declared guilty ; but it was now discovered, 
hidden by the Duke himself among some private papers, in 
his regard for that good man. The Bishop lost his office, 
and was deprived of his possessions. 

It is not very pleasant to know that while his uncle lay 
in prison under sentence of death, the young King was 
being vastly entertained by plays, and dances, and shaln 
fights : bnt there is no doubt of it, for he kept a journal 
himself. It is pleasanter to know that not a single Roman 
Catholic was burnt in this reign for holding that religion; 
though two wretched victims suffered for heresy. One, a 
woman named Joan* Bocher, for professing some opinions 
that even she could only explain in unintelligible jargon. 
The other, a Dutchman, named Yon Paris, who practised 
as a surgeon in London. Edward was, to his credit, ex- 
ceedingly unwilling to sign the warraut for the woman’s 
execution: shedding tears before he did so, and telling 
Cranmer, who urged him to do it (though Cranmer really 
would have spared the woman at first, but for her own 
determined obstinacy), that the guilt was not his, but that 
of the man who so strongly urged the dreadful act. We 
shall see, too soon, whether the time ever came when Cra«*

mer is likely to have remembered this with sorrow and 
remorse. 

Cranmer and Ridley (at first Bishop of Rochester, and 
afterwards Bishop of London) were the most powerful of 
the clergy of this reign. Others were imprisoned and de- 
prived of their property for still adhering to the unreformed 
religion ; the most important among whom were Gardiner 
Bishop of Winchester, Heath Bishop of Worcester, Day 
Bishop of Chichester, and Bonner that Bishop of Loudon 
who was superseded by Ridley. The Princess Mary, who 
inherited her mother’s gloomy temper, and hated the re- 
formed religion as connected with her mother’s wrongs and 
sorrows — she knew nothing else about it, always refusing 
to read a single book in which it was truly described — held 
by the unreformed religion too, and was the only person in 
the kingdom for whom the old Mass was allowed to be per- 
formed ; nor would the young King have made that excep- 
tion even in her favour, but for the strong persuasions of 
Cranmer and Ridley. He always viewed it with horror; 
and when he fell into a sickly condition, after having been 
very ill, first of the measles and then of the small-pox, 
he was greatly troubled in mind to think that if he died, 
and she, the next heir to the throne, succeeded, the Roman 
Catholic religion would be set up again. 

This uneasiness, the Duke of Northumberland was not 
slow to encourage : for, if the Princess Mary came to the 
throne, he, who had taken part with the Protestants, was 
sure to be disgraced. Now, the Duchess of Suffolk was 
descended from King Henry the Seventh ; and, if she re- 
signed what little or no right she had, in favour of her 
daughter Lady Jane Grey, that would be the succession 
to promote the Duke’s greatness; because Lord Guilford 
Dudley, one of his sons, was, at this very time, newly 
married to her. So, he worked upon the King’s fears, and 
persuaded him to set aside both the Princess Mary and the 
Princess Elizabeth, and assert his right to appoint his suc- 
cessor. Accordingly the young King handed to the Crown 
lawyers a writing signed half a dozen times over by him- 
self, appointing Lady Jane Grey to succeed to the Crown, 
and requiring them to have his will made out according 
to law. They were much against it at first, and told the 
King so ; but the Duke of Northumberland — being so vio- 
lent about it that the lawyers even expected him to beat

261 


them, and hotly declaring that, stripped to his shirt, he 
would fight any man in such a quarrel — they yielded. 
Cranmer, also, at first hesitated; pleading that he had 
sworn to maintain the succession of the Crown to the Prin- 
cess Mary; but, he was a weak man in his resolutions, and 
afterwards signed the document with the rest of the Council. 

It was completed none too soon; for Edward was now 
sinking in a rapid decline; and, byway of making him bet- 
ter, they handed him over to a woman-doctor who pretended 
to be able to cure it. He speedily got worse. On the sixth 
of July, in the year one thousand five hundred and fifty- 
three, he died, very peaceably and piously, praying God, 
with his last breath, to protect the reformed religion. 

This King died in the sixteenth year of his age, and in 
the seventh of his reign; It is difficult to judge what the 
character of one so young might afterwards have become 
among so many bad, ambitious, quarrelling nobles. But, 
he was an amiable boy, of very good abilities, and had 
nothing coarse or cruel or brutal in his disposition — which 
in the son of such a father is rather surprising. 


CHAPTER XXX. 

ENGLAND UNDER MARY. 

The Duke of Northumberland was very anxious to keep 
the young King’s death a secret, in order that he might 
get the two Princesses into his power. But, the Princess 
Mary, being informed of that event as she was on her way 
to London to see her sick brother, turned her horse’s head, 
and rode away into Norfolk. The Earl of Arundel was her 
friend, and it was he who sent her warning of what had 
happened. 

As the secret could not be kept, the Duke of Northum- 
1>erland and the Council sent for the Lord Mayor of London 
and some of the aldermen, and made a merit of telling it to 
them. Then, they made it known to the people, and set 
off to inform Lady Jane Grey that she was to be Queen. 

She was a pretty girl of only sixteen, and was amiable, 
learned, and clever. When the lords who came to her f o11

on their knees before her, and told her what tidings the$ 
brought, she was so astonished that she fainted. On recov- 
ering, she expressed her sorrow for the young King’s death, 
and said that she knew she was unfit to govern the king* 
doin ; but that if she must be Queen, she prayed God to 
direct her. She was then at Sion House, near Brentford ; 
and the lords tdok her down the river in state to the Tower, 
that she night remain there (as the custom was) until she 
was crowned. But the people were not at all favourable 
to Lady Jane, considering that the right to be Queen was 
Mary’s, and greatly disliking the Duke of Northumberland. 
They were not put into a better humour by the duke’s caus- 
ing a vintner’s servant, one Gabriel Pot, to be taken up for 
expressing his dissatisfaction among the crowd, and to have 
hisears nailed to the pillory, and cut off. Some powerful 
men among the nobility deolared on Mary’s side. They 
raised troops to support her cause, had her proclaimed 
Queen at Norwich, and gathered around her at the castle 
of Framlingham, which belonged to the Duke of Norfolk. 
For, she was- not considered so safe as yet, but that it was 
best to keep her in a castle on the sea-coast, from whence 
she might be sent abroad, if necessary. 

The Council would have despatched Lady Jane’s father, 
the Duke of Suffolk, as the general of the army against 
this force; but, as Lady Jane implored that her father 
might remain with her, and as he was known to be but a 
weak man, they told the Duke of Northumberland that be 
must take the command himself. He was not very ready 
to do so, as he mistrusted the Council much ; but there was 
no help for it, and he set forth with a heavy heart, observ- 
ing to a lord who rode beside him through Shoreditch at 
the head of the troops, that, although the people pressed 
in great numbers to look at them, they were terribly silent. 

And his fears for himself turned out to be well founded. 
While he was waiting at Cambridge for further help from 
the Council, the Council took it into their heads to turn 
their backs on Lady Jane’s cause, and to take up the Prin- 
cess Mary’s. This was chiefly owing to the before-men- 
tioned Earl of Arundel, who represented to the Lord Mayor 
and aldermen, in a second interview with those sagacious 
persons, that, as for himself, he did not perceive the Re- 
formed religion to be in much danger — which Lord Pem- 
broke backed by flourishing his sword as another kind of

persuasion. The Lord Mayor and aldermen, thus enlight- 
ened, said there could be no doubt that the Princess Mary 
ought to be Queen. So, she was proclaimed at the Cross by 
Saint Paul's, and barrels of wine were given to the people, 
and they got very drunk, and danced round blazing bonfires 
— ‘little thinking, poor wretches, what other bonfires would 
soon be blazing in Queen Mary’s name. 

After a ten days* dream of royalty, Lady Jane Grey re- 
signed the Crown With great willingness, saying that she 
had only accepted it in obedience to her father and mother; 
and went gladly back to her pleasant house by the river, 
and her books. Mary then came on towards London ; and 
at Wanstead in Essex, was joined by her half-sister, the 
Princess Elizabeth. They passed through the streets of 
London to the Tower, and there the new Queen met some 
eminent prisoners then confined* in it, kissed them, and 
gave them their liberty. Among these was that Gardiner, 
Bishop of Winchester, who had been imprisoned in the last 
reign for holding to the unreformed religion. Him she 
soon made chancellor. 

The Duke of Northumberland had been taken prisoner, 
and, together with his son and five others, was quickly 
brought before the Council. He, not unnaturally, asked 
that Council, in his defence, whether it was treason to obey 
orderB that had been issued under the great seal ; and, if 
it were, whether they, who had obeyed them too, ought to 
be his judges? But they made light of these points; and, 
being resolved to have him out of the way, soon sentenced 
him to death. He had risen into power upon the death of 
another man, and made but a poor show (as might be ex- 
pected) when he himself lay low. He entreated Gardiner 
to let him live, if it were only in a mouse’s hole; and, 
when he ascended the scaffold to be beheaded on Tower 
Hill, addressed the people in a miserable way, saying that 
he had been incited by others, and exhorting them to return 
to the unreformed religion, which he told them was his 
faith. There seems reason to suppose that he expected a 
pardon even then* in return for this confession ; but it mat- 
ters little whether he did or not. His head was struck off. 

Mary was now crowned Queen. She was thirty-seven 
years of age, short and thin, wrinkled in the face, and 
very unhealthy. But she had a great liking for show and 
for bright colours, and all the ladies of her Court were

magnificently dressed. She had a great liking too for old 
customs, without much sense in them ; and she was oiled 
in the oldest way, and blessed in the oldest way, and done 
all manner of things to in the oldest way, at her corona- 
tion, I hope they did her good. 

She soon began to show her desire to put down the Re- 
formed religion, and put up the unreformed one ; though it 
was dangerous work as yet, the people being something 
wiser than they used to be. They even cast a shower of 
stones — and among them a dagger — at one of the royal 
chaplains who attacked the Reformed religion in a public 
sermon. But the Queen and her priests went steadily on. 
Ridley, the powerful bishop of the last reign, was seized 
and sent to the Tower. Latimer, also celebrated among 
the Clergy of the last reign, was likewise sent to the Tower, 
and Cranmer speedily followed. Latimer was an aged 
man ; and, as his guards took him through Smithfield, he 
looked round it, and said, “ This is a place that hath long 
groaned for me.” For he knew well, what kind of bonfires 
would soon be burning. Nor was the knowledge confined 
to him. The prisons were fast filled with the chief Prot- 
estants, who were there left rotting in darkness, hunger, 
dirt, and separation from their friends; many, who had 
time left them for escape, fled from the kingdom ; and the 
dullest of the people began, now, to see what was coming. 

It came on fast. A Parliament was got together ; not 
without strong suspicion of unfairness ; and they annulled 
the divorce, formerly pronounced by Cranmer between the 
Queen’s mother and King Henry the Eighth, and unmade 
all the laws on the subject of religion that had been made 
in the last King Edward’s reign. They began their pro- 
ceedings, in violation of the law, by having the old mass 
said before them in Latin, and by turning out a bishop who 
would not kneel down. They also declared guilty of trea- 
son, Lady Jane Grey for aspiring to the Crown; her hus- 
band, for being her husband; and Cranmer, for not believ- 
ing in the mass aforesaid. They then prayed the Queen 
graciously to choose a husband for herself, as soon as might 
be 

Now, the question who should be the Queen’s husband 
had given rise to a great deal of discussion, and to several 
contending parties. Some said Cardinal Pole was the man 
— but the Queen was of opinion that he was not the man*

he being too old and too much of a student. Others said 
that the gallant young Courtenay, whom the Queen had 
made Earl of Devonshire, was the man — and the Queen 
thought so too, for a while ; but she changed her mind. 
At last it appeared that Philip, Prince of Spain, was 
certainly the man — though certainly not the people’s man; 
for they detested the idea of such a marriage from the be- 
ginning to the end, and murmured that the Spaniard would 
establish in England, by the aid of foreign soldiers, the 
worst abuses of the Popish religion, and even the terrible 
Inquisition itself. 

These discontents gave rise to a conspiracy for marrying 
young Courtenay to the Princess Elizabeth, and setting 
them up, with popular tumults all over the kingdom, against 
the Queen. This was discovered in time by Gardiner ; but 
in Kent, the old bold county, the people rose in their old 
bold way. Sir Thomas Wyat, a man of great daring, was 
their leader. He raised his standard at Maidstone, marched 
on to Rochester, established himself in the old castle there, 
and prepared to hold out against the Duke of Norfolk, who 
came against him with a party of the Queen’s guards, and 
a body of five hundred London men. The London men, 
however, were all for Elizabeth, and not at all for Mary. 
They declared, under the castle walls, for Wyat ; the duke 
retreated ; and Wyat came on to Deptford, at the head of 
fifteen thousand men. 

But these, in their turn, fell away. When he catiie to 
Southwark, there were only two thousand left. Not dis- 
mayed by finding the London citizens in arms, and the 
guns at the Tower ready to oppose his crossing the river 
there, Wyat led them off to # Kingston-upon-Thames, intend* 
ing to cross the bridge that he knew to be in that place, 
and so to work his way round to Ludgate, one of the old 
gates of the City. He found the bridge broken down, but 
mended it, came across, and bravely fought his way up 
Fleet Street to Ludgate Hill. Finding the gate closed 
against him, he fought his way back again, sword in hand, 
to Temple Bar. Here, being overpowered, he surrendered 
himself, and three or four hundred of his men were taken, 
besides a hundred killed. Wyat, in a moment of weakness 
(and perhaps of torture) was afterwards made to accuse 
the Princess Elizabeth as his accomplice to some very small 
extent. But his manhood soon returned to him, and Y

refused to save his life by making any more false confes- 
sions. He was quartered and distributed in the usual bru- 
tal way, and from fifty to a hundred of his followers were 
hanged. The rest were led out, with halters round their 
necks, to be pardoned, and to make a parade of crying out, 
“ God save Queen Mary ! ” 

In the danger of this rebellion, the Queen showed herself 
to be a woman of courage and spirit. She disdained to 
retreat to any place of safety, and went down to the Guild- 
hall, sceptre in hand, and made a gallant speech to the 
Lord Mayor and citizens. But on the day after Wyat’s 
defeat, she did the most cruel act, even of her cruel reign, 
in signing the warrant for the execution of Lady Jane 
Grey. 

They tried to persuade Lady Jane to accept the unre- 
formed religion ; but she steadily refused. On the morn- 
ing when she was to die, she saw from her window the 
bleeding and headless body of her husband brought back in 
a cart from the scaffold on Tower Hill where he had laid 
down his life. But, as she had declined to see him before 
his execution, lest she should be overpowered and not make 
a good end, so, she even now showed a constancy and calm- 
ness that will never be forgotten. She came up to the 
scaffold with a firm step and a quiet face, and addressed 
the bystanders in a steady voice. They were not numer- 
ous ; for she was too young, too innocent and fair, to be 
murdered before the people on Tower Hill, as her husband 
had just been; so, the place of her execution was within 
the Tower itself. She said that she had done an unlawful 
act in taking what was Queen Mary’s right; but that she 
had done so with no bad intent, and that she died a hum- 
ble Christian. She begged the executioner to despatch her 
quickly, and she asked him, “ Will you take my head off 
before I lay me down?” He answered, “No, Madam,” 
and then she was very quiet while they bandaged her eyes. 
Being blinded, and unable to see the block on which she 
was to lay her young head, she was seen to feel about for 
it with her hands, and was heard to say, confused, “ O what 
shall I do ! Where is it? ” Then they guided her to the 
right place, and the executioner struck off her head. You 
know too well, now, what dreadful deeds the executioner 
did in England, through many many years, and how his 
axe descended on the hateful block through the necks of

some of the bravest, wisest, and best in the land. Bat it 
never struck so cruel and so vile a blow as this. 

The father of Lady Jane soon followed, but was little 
pitied. Queen Mary’s next object was to lay hold of Eliza- 
beth, and this was pursued with great eagerness. Five 
hundred men were sent to her retired house at Ashridge, 
by Berkhampstead, with orders to bring her up, alive or 
dead. They got there at ten at night, when she was sick 
iu bed. But, their leaders followed her lady into her bed- 
chamber, whence she was brought out betimes next morn- 
ing, and put into a litter to be conveyed to London. She 
was so weak and ill, that she was five days on the road ; 
still, she was so resolved to be seen by the people that she 
had the curtains of the litter opened ; and so, very pale 
and sickly, passed through the streets. She wrote to her 
sister, saying she was innocent of any crime, and asking 
why she was made a prisoner ; but she got no answer, and 
was ordered to the Tower. They took her in by the 
Traitor’s Gate, to which she objected, but in vain. One 
of the lords who conveyed her offered to cover her with his 
cloak, as it was raining, but she put it away from her, 
proudly and scornfully, and passed into the Tower, and 
sat down in a courtyard on a stone. They besought her to 
come in out of the wet; but she answered that it was bet- 
ter sitting there, than in a worse place. At length she 
went to her apartment, where she was kept a prisoner, 
though not so close a prisoner as at Woodstock, whither 
she was afterwards removed, and where she is said to have 
one day envied a milkmaid whom she heard singing in the 
sunshine as she went through the green fields. Gardiner, 
than whom there were not many worse men among the 
fierce and sullen priests, cared little to keep secret his stern 
desire for her death: being used to say that it was of little 
service to shake off the leaves, and lop the branches of the 
tree of heresy, if its root, the hope of heretics, were left. 
He failed, however, in his benevolent design. Elizabeth 
was, at length, released; and Hatfield House was assigned 
to her as a residence, under the care of one Sib Thomas 
Pope. 

It would seem that Philip, the Prince of Spain, was a 
main cause of this change in Elizabeth’s fortunes. He was 
not an amiable man, being, on the contrary, proud, over- 
bearing, and gloomy; but he and the Spanish lords who

came over with him, assuredly did discountenance the idea 
of doing any violence to the Princess. It may have been 
mere prudence, but we will hope it was manhood and 
honour. The Queen had been expecting her husband with 
great impatience, and at length he came, to her great joy, 
though he never cared much for her. They were married 
by Gardiner, at Winchester, and there was more holiday- 
making among the people ; but they had their old distrust 
of this Spanish marriage, in which even the Parliament 
shared. Though the members of that Parliament were 
far from honest, and were strongly suspected to have been 
bought with Spanish money, they would pass no bill to 
enable the Queen to set aside the Princess Elizabeth and 
appoint her own successor. 

Although Gardiner failed in this object, as well as in the 
darker one of bringing the Princess to the scaffold, he went 
on at a great pace in the revival of the unreformed religion. 
A new Parliament was packed, in which there were no 
Protestants. Preparations were made to receive Cardinal 
Pole in England as the Pope’s messenger, bringing his holy 
declaration that all the nobility who had acquired Church 
property, should keep it — which was done to enlist their 
selfish interest on the Pope’s side. Then a great scene was 
enacted, which was the triumph of the Queen’s plans. Car- 
dinal Pole arrived in great splendour and dignity, and was 
received with great pomp. The Parliament joined in a 
petition expressive of their sorrow at the change in the na- 
tional religion, and praying him to receive the country 
again into the Popish Church. With the Queen sitting on 
her throne, and the King on one side of her, and the Car- 
dinal on the other, and the Parliament present, Gardiner 
read the petition aloud. The Cardinal then made a great 
speech, and was so obliging as to say that all was forgotten 
and forgiven, and that the kingdom was solemnly made 
Roman Catholic again. 

Everything was now ready for the lighting of the terrible 
bonfires. The Queen having declared to the Council, in 
writing, that she would wish none of her subjects to be 
burnt without some of the Council being present, and that 
she would particularly wish there to be good sermons at 
all burnings, the Council knew pretty well what was to be 
done next. So, after the Cardinal had blessed all the 
bishops as a preface to the burnings, the Chancellor Gardi*

ner opened a High Court at Saint Mary Overy, on the 
Southwark side of London Bridge, for the trial of heretics. 
Here, two of the late Protestant clergymen, Hooper, Bishop 
of Gloucester, and Rogers, a Prebendary of Saint Paul’s, 
were brought to be tried. Hooper was tried first for being 
married, though a priest, and for not believing in the mass. 
He admitted both of these accusations, and said that the 
mass was a wicked imposition. Then they tried Rogers, 
who said the same. Next morning the two were brought 
up to be sentenced; and then Rogers said that his poor 
wife, being a German woman and a stranger in the land, 
he hoped might be allowed to come to speak to him before 
he died. To this the inhuman Gardiner replied, that she 
was not his wife. “ Yea, but she is, my lord,” said Rogers, 
“and she hath been my wife these eighteen years.” His 
request was still refused, and they were both sent to New- 
gate ; all those who stood in the streets to sell things, being 
ordered to put out their lights that the people might not 
see them. But, the people stood at their doors with can- 
dles in their hands, and prayed for them as they went by. 
Soon afterwards, Rogers was taken qut of jail to be burnt 
in Smithfield ; and, in the crowd as he went along, he saw 
his poor wife and his ten children, of whom the youngest 
was a little baby. And so he was burnt to death. 

The next day, Hooper, who was to’ be burnt at Glouces- 
ter, was brought out to take his last journey, and was made 
to wear a hood over his face that he might not be known by 
the people. But, they did know him for all that, down 
in his own part of the country ; and, when he came near 
Gloucester, they lined the road, making prayers and lamen- 
tations. His guards took him to a lodging, where he slept 
soundly all night. At nine o’clock next morning, he was 
brought forth leaning on a staff ; for he had taken cold in 
prison, and was infirm. The iron stake, and the iron chain 
which was to bind him to it, were fixed up near a great 
elm-tree in a pleasant open place before the cathedral, 
where, on peaceful Sundays, he had been accustomed to 
preach and to pray, when he was bishop of Gloucester. 
This tree, which had no leaves then, it being February, was 
fiUed with people ; and the priests of Gloucester College 
were looking complacently on from a window, and there 
was a great concourse of spectators in every spot from 
which a glimpse of the dreadful sight could be beheld.

When the old man kneeled down on the small platform at 
the foot of the stake, and prayed aloud, the nearest people 
were observed to be so attentive to his prayers that they 
were ordered to stand farther back ; for it did not suit 
the Romish Church to have those Protestant words heard. 
His prayers concluded, he went up to the stake and was 
stripped to his shirt, and chained ready for the fire. One 
of his guards had such compassion on him that, to shorten 
his agonies, he tied some packets of gunpowder about him. 
Then they heaped up wood and straw and reeds, and set 
them all alight. But, unhappily, the wood was green and 
damp, and there was a wind blowing that blew what flame 
there was, away. Thus, through three-quarters of an hour, 
the good old man was scorched and roasted and smoked, as 
the fire rose and sank ; and all that time they saw him, as 
he burned, moving his lips in prayer, and beating his breast 
with one hand, even after the other was burnt away and 
had fallen off. 

Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer were taken to Oxford to 
dispute with a commission of priests and doctors about the 
mass. They were shamefully ti*eated ; and it is recorded 
that the Oxford scholars hissed and howled and groaned, 
and misconducted themselves in an anything but a scholarly 
way. The prisoners were taken back to jail, and afterwards 
tried in Saint Mary’s Church. They were all found guilty. 
On the sixteenth of the month of October, Ridley and Lati- 
mer were brought out, to make another of the dreadful 
bonfires. 

The scene of the suffering of these two good Protestant 
men was in the City ditch, near Baliol College. On coining 
to the dreadful spot, they kissed the stakes, and then em- 
braced each other. And then a learned doctor got up into 
a pulpit which was placed there, and preached a sermon 
from the text, “ Though I give my body to be burned, and 
have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.” When you 
think of the charity of burning men alive, you may imag- 
ine that this learned doctor had a rather brazen face. Rid- 
ley would have answered his sermon when it came to an 
end, but was not allowed. When Latimer was stripped, ft 
appeared that he had dressed himself under his other 
slothes, in a new shroud ; and, as he stood in it before all 
the people, it was noted of him, and long remembered, that, 
whereas he had been stooping and feeble but a few minutes

!>efore, he now stood upright and handsome, in the knowl- 
edge that he was dying for a just and a great ealise. Hid- 
ley-g brother-in-law was there with bags of gunpowder; 
and when they were both chained up, he tied them round 
their bodies. Then, a light was thrown upon the pile to 
lire it. u Be of good comfort. Master Ridley,” said Lati- 
mer, at that awful moment, “ and play the man ! We shall 
this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, 
as I trust shall never be put out. ” And then he was seen 
to make motions with his hands as if he were washing 
them in the flames, and to stroke his aged face with them, 
and was heard to cry, “ Father of Heaven, receive my 
soul ! ” He died quickly, but the fire, after having burned 
the legB of Ridley, sunk. There he lingered, chained to 
the iron post, and crying, “0! I cannot burn! 0! for 
Christ's sake let the fire come unto me! ” And still, when 
his brother-in-law had heaped on more wood, he was heard 
through the blinding smoke, still dismally crying, “O! I 
cannot bum, I cannot burn ! ” At last, the gunpowder 
caught fire, and ended his miseries. 

Five days after this fearful scene, Gardiner went to his 
tremendous account before God, for the cruelties he had so 
much assisted in committing. 

Craniner remained still alive and hi prison. He was 
brought out again in February, for more examining and 
trying, by Bonner, Bishop of London: another man of 
blood, who had succeeded to Gardiner's work, even in his 
lifetime, when Gardiner was tired of it. Craniner was now 
degraded as a priest, and left for death ; bat, if the Queen 
hated any one on earth, she hated him, and it was resolved 
that he should be ruined and disgraced to the utmost. 
There is no doubt that the Queen and her husband person- 
ally urged on these deeds, becaufse they wrote to che Coun- 
cil, urging them to be active in the kindling of the fearful 
fires. As Craniner was known not to be a firm man, a plan 
was laid for surrounding him with artful people, and induc- 
ing him to recant to the unreformed religion. Deans and 
friars visited him, played at bowls with him, showed him 
various attentions, talked persuasively with him, gave him 
money for his prison comforts, and induced him to sign,, I 
fear, as many as six recantations. But when, after all, he 
was taken out to be burnt, he was nobly true to his better 
self, and made a glorious end.

272 A CHILD'S HISTORY OF ENGLAND. 

After prayers and a sermon, Dr. Cole, the preacher of the 
day (who had been one of the artful priests about Cranmer 
in prison), required him to make a public confession of his 
faith before the people. This, Cole did, expecting that he 
would declare himself a Roman Catholic. “ I will make 
a profession of my faith,” said Cranmer, “ and with a good 
will too. ” 

Then, he arose before them all, and took from the sleeve 
of his robe a written prayer and read it aloud. That done, 
he kneeled and said the Lord’s Prayer, all the people join- 
ing ; and then he arose again and told them that he believed 
in the Bible, and that in what he had lately written, he 
had written what was not the truth, and that, because his 
right hand had signed those papers, he would burn his 
right hand first when he came to the fire. As for the 
Pope, he did refuse him and denounce him as the enemy 
of Heaven. Hereupon the pious Dr. Cole cried out to 
the guards to stop that heretic’s mouth and take him 
away. 

So they took him away, and chained him to the stake, 
where he hastily took off his own clothes to make ready for 
the flames. And he stood before the people with a bald 
head and a white and flowing beard. He was so firm now, 
when the worst was come, that he again declared against 
his recantation, and was so impressive and so undismayed, 
a certain lord, who was one of the directors of the execu- 
tion, called out to the men to make haste ! When the fire 
was lighted, Cranmer, true to his latest word, stretched 
out his right hand, and crying out, “This hand hath 
offended ! ” held it among the flames, until it blazed and 
burned away. His heart was found entire among his ashes, 
and he left at last a memorable name in English history. 
Cardinal Pole celebrated the day by saying his first mass, 
and next day he was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 
Orunmer’s place. 

The Queen’s husband, who was now mostly abroad in his 
own dominions, and generally made a coarse jest of her to 
his more familiar courtiers, was at war with France, and 
came over to seek the assistance of England. England was 
very unwilling to engage in a French war for his sake ; but 
it happened that the King of France, at this very time, 
aided a descent upon the English coast. Hence, war was 
declared, greatly to Philip’s satisfaction; and the Queen

raised a sum of money with which to carry it on, by every 
unjustifiable means in her power. It met with no profit- 
able return, for the French Duke of Guise surprised Calais, 
and the English sustained a complete defeat. The losses 
they met with in France greatly mortified the national 
pride, and the Queen never recovered the blow. 

There was a bad fever raging in England at this time, 
and I am glad to write that the Queen took it, and the hour 
of her death came. “ When I am dead and my body is 
opened,” she said to those around her, “ye shall find 
Calais written on my heart.” # I should have thought, if 
anything were written on it, they would have found the 
words — Jane Grey, Hooper, Rogers, Ridley, Latimer, 
Cranmer, and three hundred people burnt alive 

WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF MY WICKED REIGN, INCLUDING 
SIXTY WOMEN AND FORTY LITTLE CHILDREN. But it is 

enough that their deaths were written in Heaven. 

The Queen died on the seventeenth of November, fifteen 
hundred and fifty-eight, after reigning not quite five years 
and a half, and in the forty-fourth year of her age. Car- 
dinal Pole died of the same fever next day. 

As Bloody Queen Mary, this woman has become fa- 
mous, and as Bloody Queen Mary, she will ever be justly 
remembered with horror and detestation in Great Britain. 
Her memory has been held in such abhorrence that some 
writers have arisen in later years to take her part, and to 
show that she was, upon the whole, quite an amiable and 
cheerful sovereign ! “ By their fruits ye shall know them, ” 

said Our Saviour. The stake and the fire were the fruits 
of this reign, and you will judge this Queen by nothing 
else. 


CHAPTER XXXI. 

ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH. 

There was great rejoicing all over the land when the 
Lords of the Council went down to Hatfield, to hail the 
Princess Elizabeth as the new Queen of England. Weary 
of the barbarities of Mary’s reign, the people looked with 
hope and gladness to the new Sovereign. The nation 
seemed to wake from a horrible dream ; and Heaven, so

long hidden by the smoke of the fires that roasted men and 
women to death, appeared to brighten once more. 

Queen Elizabeth was five-and-twenty years of age when 
she rode through the streets of London, from the Tower to 
Westminster Abbey, to be crowned. Her countenance was 
strongly marked, but on the whole, commanding and digni- 
fied ; her hair was red, and her nose something too long 
and sharp for a woman’s. She was not the beautiful creat- 
ure her courtiers made out ; but she was well enough, and 
no doubt looked all the better for coming after the dark 
and gloomy Mary. She was well educated, but a round- 
about writer, aud rather a hard swearer and coarse talker. 
She was clever, but cunning and deceitful, and inherited 
much of her father’s violent temper. I mention this now, 
because she has been so over-praised by one party, and so 
over-abused by another, that it is hardly possible to under- 
stand the greater part of her reign without first understand- 
ing what kind of woman she really was. 

She began her reign with the great advantage of haring 
a very wise and careful minister, Sir William Cecil, 
whom she afterwards made Lord Burleigh. Altogether, 
the people had greater reason for rejoicing than they usu- 
ally had, when there were processions in the streets; and 
they were happy with some reason. All kinds of shows 
and images were set up ; Goo and Magog were hoisted to 
the top of Temple Bar 5 and (which was more to the pur- 
pose) the Corporation dutifully presented the young Queen 
with the sum of a thousand marks in gold — so heavy a 
present, that she was obliged to take it into her carriage 
with both hands. The coronation was a great success ; and, 
on the next day, one of the courtiers presented a petition 
to the new Queen, praying that as it was the custom to re- 
lease some prisoners on such occasions, she would have the 
goodness to release the four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, 
Luke, and John, and also the Apostle Saint Paul, who had 
been for some time shut up in a strange language so that 
the people could not get at them. 

To this, the Queen replied that it would be better first to 
inquire of themselves whether they desired to be released 
or not ; and, as a means of finding out, a great public dis- 
cussion — a sort of religious tournament — was appointed to 
take place between certain champions* of the two religions, 
in Westminster Abbey. You may suppose that it was

to benefit by what they repeat or read, it is rather neces- 
sary they should understand something about it. Accord- 
ingly, a Church Service in plain English was settled, and 
other laws and regulations were made, completely establish- 
ing the great work of the Reformation. The Romish bish- 
ops and champions were not harshly dealt with, all things 
considered ; and the Queen's ministers were both prudent 
and merciful. 

The one great trouble of this reign, and the unfortunate 
cause of the greater part of such turmoil and bloodshed as 
occurred in it, was Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots. We 
will try to understand, ill as few words as possible, who 
Mary was, wliat she was, and how she came to be a thorn 
in the royal pillow of Elizabeth. 

She was the daughter of the Queen Regent of Scotland, 
Mary of Guise. She had been married, when a mere 
child, to the Dauphin, the son and heir of the King of 
France. The Pope, who pretended that no one could 
rightfully wear the crown of England without his gracious 
permission, was strongly opposed to Elizabeth, who had 
not asked for the said gracious permission. And as Mary 
Queen of Scots would have inherited the English crown in 
right of her birth, supposing the English Parliament not to 
have altered the succession, the Pope himself, and most of 
the discontented who were followers of his, maintained 
that Mary was the rightful Queen Of England, and Elizabeth 
the wrongful Queen. Mary being so closely connected with 
France, and France being jealous of England, there was far 
greater danger in this than there would have been if she 
had had no alliance with that great power. And when her 
young husband, on the death of his father, became Francis 
the Second, King of France, the matter grew very serious. 
For, the young couple styled themselves King and Queen 
of England, and the Pope was disposed to help them by 
doing all the mischief he could. 

Now, the Reformed religion, under the guidance of a 
stem and powerful preacher, named John Knox, and other 
such men, had been making fierce progress in Scotland. It 
was still a half savage country, where there was a great 
deal of murdering and rioting continually going on $ and 
the Reformers, instead of reforming those evils as they 
should have done, went to work in the ferocious old Scot-

tish spirit, laying churches and chapels waste, pulling 
down pictures and altars, and knocking about the Grey 
Friars, and the Black Friars, and the White Friars, and 
the friars of all sorts of colours, in all directions. This 
obdurate and harsh spirit of the Scottish Reformers (the 
Scotch have always been rather a sullen and frowning peo- 
ple in religious matters) put up the blood of the Romish 
French court, and caused France to send troops over to 
Scotland, with the hope of setting the friars of all sorts of 
colours on their legs again; of conquering that country 
first, and England afterwards ; and so crushing the Refor- 
mation all to pieces. The Scottish Reformers, who had 
formed a great league which they called The Congregation 
of the Lord, secretly represented to Elizabeth that, if the 
Reformed religion got the worst of it with them, it would 
be likely to get the worst of it in England too ; and thus, 
Elizabeth, though she had a high notion of the rights of 
Kings and Queens to do anything they liked, sent an army 
to Scotland to support the Reformers, who were in arms 
against their sovereign. All these proceedings led to a 
treaty of peace at Edinburgh, under which the French con- 
sented to depart from the kingdom. By a separate treaty, 
Mary and her young husband engaged to renounce their 
assumed title of King and Queen of England. But this 
treaty they never fulfilled. 

It happened, soon after matters had got to this state, 
that the young French King died, leaving Mary a young 
widow. She was then invited by her Scottish subjects to 
return home and reign over them; and as she was not now 
happy where she was, she, after a little time, complied. 

Elizabeth had been Queen three years, when Mary Queen 
of Scots embarked at Calais for her own rough quarrelling 
country. As she came out of the harbour, a vessel was 
lost before her eyes, and she said, “ 0 1 good God ! what 
an omen this is for such a voyage I ” She was very fond of 
France, and sat on the deck, looking back at it and weep- 
ing, until it was quite dark. When she went to bed, she 
directed to be called at daybreak, if the French coast were 
still visible, that she might behold it for the last time. As 
it proved to be a clear morning, this was done, and she 
again wept for the country she was leaving, and said many 
times, “ Farewell, France ! Farewell, France ! I shall never 
see thee again I n All this was long remembered after-

wards, as sorrowful and interesting in a fair young prin- 
cess of nineteen* Indeed, I am afraid it gradually came, 
together with her other distresses, to surround her with 
greater sympathy than she deserved. 

When she came to Scotland, and took up her abode at 
the palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh, she found herself 
among uncouth strangers and wild uncomfortable customs 
very different from her experiences in the court of France. 
The very people who were disposed to love her, made her 
head ache when she was tired out by her voyage, with a 
serenade of discordant music — a fearful concert of bag- 
pipes, I suppose — and brought her and her train home to 
her palace on miserable little Scotch horses that appeared 
to be half starved. Among the people who were not dis- 
posed to love her, she found the powerful leaders of the 
Reformed Church, who were bitter upon her amusements, 
however innocent, and denounced music and dancing as 
works of the devil* John Knox himself often lectured her, 
violently and angrily, and did much to make her life un- 
happy. All these reasons confirmed her old attachment to 
the Romish religion, and caused her, there is no doubt, 
most imprudently and dangerously both for herself and for 
England too, to give a solemn pledge to the heads of the 
Romish Church that if she ever succeeded to the English 
crown, she would set up that religion again. In reading 
her unhappy history, you must always remember this ; and 
also that during her whole life she was constantly put for- 
ward against the Queen, in some form or other, by the 
Romish party. 

That Elizabeth, on the other hand, was not inclined to 
like her, is pretty certain. Elizabeth was very vain and 
jealous, and had an extraordinary dislike to people being 
married. She treated Lady Catherine Grey, sister of the 
beheaded Lady J ane, with such shameful severity, for no 
other reason than her being secretly married, that she died 
and her husband was mined ; so, when a second marriage 
for Mary began to be talked about, probably Elizabeth dis- 
liked her more. Not that Elizabeth wanted suitors of her 
I own, for they started up from Spain, Austria, Sweden, and 
| England. Her En glish lover at this time, and one whom she 
much favoured too, was Lord Robert Dudley, Earl of 
Leicester — himself secretly married to Amy Robsart, the 
daughter of an English gentleman, whom he was strongly

suspected of causing to be murdered, down at his country 
seat, Cumnor Hall ih Berkshire, that he might be free to 
marry the Queen. Upon this story, the great writer, Sir 
Walter Scott, has founded one of his best romances. 
But if Elizabeth knew how to lead her handsome favourite 
on, for her own vanity and pleasure, she knew how to stop 
him for her own pride ; and his love, and all the other pro- 
posals, came to nothing. The Queen always declared in 
good set speeches, that she would never be married at all, 
but would live and die a Maiden Queen, it was a very 
pleasant and meritorious declaration I suppose ; but it has 
been puffed and trumpeted so much, that I am rather tired 
of it myself. 

Divers princes proposed to marry Mary, but the English 
court had reasons for being jealous of them all, and even 
proposed as a matter of policy that she should marry that 
very Earl of Leicester who had aspired to be the husband 
of Elizabeth. At last, Lord DahnLey, son of the Earl 
of Lennox, and himself descended from the Royal Family 
of Scotland, went over with Elizabeth* s consent to try his 
fortune at Holyrood. He was a tall simpleton ; and Could 
dance and play the guitar; but I know of nothing else he 
could do, unless it were to get very druhk, and eat glut- 
tonously, and make a contemptible spectacle of himself in 
many mean and vain ways. However,- he gained Mary’s 
heart, not disdaining in the pursuit of his object to ally 
himself with one of her secretaries, David Rizzio, who 
had great influence with her. He soon married the Queen. 
This marriage does not say much for her, but what fol- 
lowed will presently say less. 

Mary’s brother, the Earl of Murray, and head of the 
Protestant party in Scotland, had opposed this marriage, 
partly on religious grounds, and partly perhaps from per- 
sonal dislike of the yery contemptible bridegroom. When 
it had taken place, through Mary’s gaining over to it the 
more powerful of the lords about her, she banished Murray 
for his pains ; and, when he and some other nobles rose in 
arms to support the Reformed religion, she herself, within 
a month of her wedding day, rode against them in armour 
with loaded pistols in her saddle. Driven out of Scotland, 
they presented themselves before Elizabeth — who called 
them traitors in public, and. assisted them in private, ac- 
cording to her crafty nature*

Mary had been married but a little while, when she be- 
gan to hate her husband, who, in his turn, began to hate 
that David Rizzio, with whom he had leagued to gain her 
favour, and whom he now believed to be her lover. He 
hated Rizzio to that extent, that he made a compact with 
Lorp Ruthven and three other lords to get rid of him by 
murder. This wicked agreement they made in solemn 
secrecy upon the first of March, fifteen hundred and sixty- 
sir, and on the night of Saturday the ninth, the conspira- 
tors were brought by Darnley up a private staircase, dark 
and steep, into a range of rooms where they knew that 
Mary was sitting at supper with her sister, Lady Argyle, 
and this doomed man. When they went into the room, 
Darnley took the Queen round the waist, and Lord Ruth- 
ven, who had risen from a bed of sickness to do this mur- 
der, came in, gaunt and ghastly, leaning on two men. 
Rizzio ran behind the Que&n for shelter and protection. 
“ Let him come out of the room,” said Ruthven. “ He 
shall not leave the room,” replied the Queen \ * I read bis 
danger in your face, and it is my will that he remain here.” 
They then set upon him, struggled with him, overturned 
the table, dragged him out, and killed him with fifty-six 
stabs. When the Queen heard that he was dead, she said, 
“ No more tears. I will think now of revenge 1 ” 

Within a day or two, she gained her husband over, and 
prevailed on the tall idiot to abandon the conspirators and 
fly with her to Dunbar. There, he issued a proclamation, 
audaciously and falsely denying that he had any knowledge 
of the late bloody business ; and there they were joined by 
the Earl Botuwem. and some other nobles. With their 
help, they raised eight thousand men, returned to Edin- 
burgh, and drove the assassins into England. Mary soon 
afterwards gave birth to a son— still thinking of revenge. 

That she should have had a greater scorn for her hus- 
band after his late cowardice and treaohery than she had 
had before, was natural enough. There is little doubt that 
she now began to love Both well instead, and to plan with 
him means of getting rid of Darnley. Bothwell had such 
power over her that he induced her even to pardon the 
assassins of Rizzio. The arrangements for the christening of 
the young Prince were entrusted to him, and he was one of 
the most important people at the ceremony, where the child 
was named James : Elizabeth being hia godmother, though

not present on the occasion. A week afterwards, Darnley, 
who had left Mary and gone to his father’s house at Glas- 
gow, being taken ill with the small-pox, she sent her own 
physician to attend him. But there is reason to apprehend 
that this was merely a show and a pretence, and that 
she knew what was doing, when Bothwell within another 
month proposed to one of the late conspirators against Riz- 
zio, to murder Darnley, “ for that it was the Queen’s mind 
that he should be taken away.” It is certain that on that 
very day she wrote to her ambassador in France, complain- 
ing of him, and yet went immediately to Glasgow, feigning 
to be very anxious about him, and to love him very much. 
If she wanted to get him in her power, she succeeded to 
her heart’s content; for she induced him to go back with 
her to Edinburgh, and to occupy, instead of the palace, a 
lone house outside the city called the Kirk of Field. Here, 
he lived for about a week. One Sunday night, she remained 
with him until ten o’clock, and then left him, to go to 
Holyrood to be present at an entertainment given in cele- 
bration of the marriage of one of her favourite servants. 
At two o’clock in the morning the city was shaken by a 
great explosion, and the Kirk of Field was blown to 
atoms. 

Darnley’ s body was found next day lying under a tree 
at some distance. How it came there, undisfigured and un- 
scorched by gunpowder, and how this crime came to be so 
clumsily and strangely committed, it is impossible to dis- 
cover. The deceitful character of Mary, and the deceitful 
character of Elizabeth, have rendered almost every part of 
their joint history uncertain and obscure. But, I fear that 
Mary was unquestionably a party to her husband’s murder, 
and that this was the revenge she had threatened. The 
Scotch people universally believed it. Voices cried out in 
the streets of Edinburgh in the dead of the night, for jus- 
tice on the murderess. Placards were posted by unknown 
hands in the public places denouncing Both well as the mur- 
derer, and the Queen as his accomplice ; and, when he af- 
terwards married her (though himself already married), 
previously making a show of taking her prisoner by force, 
the indignation of the people knew no bounds. The women 
particularly are described as having been quite frantic 
against the Queen, and to have hooted and cried after her 
in the streets with terrific vehemence.

Such guilty unions seldom prosper. This husband and 
wife had lived together but a month, when they were sepa- 
rated for ever by the successes of a band of Scotch nobles 
who associated against them for the protection of the young 
Prince: whom Both well had vainly endeavoured to lay 
hold of, and whom he would certainly have murdered, if 
the Earl of Mar, in whose hands the boy was, had not 
.been firmly and honourably faithful to his trust. Before 
this angry power, Both well fled abroad, where he died, a 
prisoner and mad, nine miserable years afterwards. Mary 
being found by the associated lords to deceive them at every 
turn, was sent a prisoner to Lochleven Castle ; which, as it 
stood in the midst of a lake, could only be approacheed by 
boat. Here, one Lord Lindsay, who was so much of a 
brute that the nobles would have done better if they had 
chosen a mere gentleman for their messenger, made her 
sign her abdication, and appoint Murray Regent of Scot- 
land. Here, too, Murray saw her in a sorrowing and hum- 
bled state. 

She had better have remained in the castle of Lochleven, 
dull prison as it was, with the rippling of the lake against 
it, and the moving shadows of the water ou the room-walls ; 
but she could not rest there, and more t lan once tried to 
escape. The first time she had nearly mcceeded, dressed 
in the clothes of her own washerwoman, but, putting up 
her hand to prevent one of the boatmen from lifting her 
veil, the men suspected her, seeing how white it was, and 
rowed her back again. A short time af er wards, her fasci- 
nating manners enlisted in her cause a Doy in the castle, 
called the little Douglas, who, while t a 9 family were at 
supper, stole the keys of the great gate, went softly out 
with the Queen, locked the gate on the outside, and rowed 
her away across the lake, sinking the keys as they went 
along. On the opposite shore she wzs met by another 
Douglas, and some few lords ; and, so accompanied, rode 
away on horseback to Hamilton, where they raised three 
thousand men. Here, she issued a proclamation declaring 
that the abdication she had signed in h sr prison was ille- 
gal, and requiring the Regent to yield to his lawful Queen. 
Being a steady soldier, and in no way discomposed al- 
though he was without an army, Murray pretended to treat 
with her, until he had collected a force a l Jout half equal to 
her own, and then he gave her battle. In one quarter of

an hoar he cut down all her hopes. She had another weary 
ride on horseback of sixty long Scotch miles, and took shel- 
ter at Dundrennan Abbey, whence she fled for safety to 
Elizabeth’s dominions. 

Mary Queen of Scots came to England — to her own ruin, 
the trouble of the kingdom, and the misery and death of 
many — in the year one thousand five hundred and sixty- 
eight. How she left it and the world, nineteen years after- 
wards, we have now to see. 

SECOND PART. 

When Mary Queen of Scots arrived in England, without 
money and even without any other clothes than those she 
wore, she wrote to Elizabeth, representing herself as an 
innocent and injured piece of Royalty, and entreating her 
assistance to oblige her Scottish subjects to take her back 
again and obey her. But, as her character was already 
known in England to be a very different one from what she 
made it out to be, she was told in answer that she must first 
clear herself. Made uneasy by this condition, Mary, rather 
than stay in England, would have gone to Spain, or to 
France, or would even have gone back to Scotland. But, 
as her doing either would have been likely to trouble Eng- 
land afresh, it was decided that she should be detained 
here. She first came to Carlisle, and, after that, was 
moved about from castle to castle, as was considered neces- 
sary; but England she never left again. 

After trying very hard to get rid of the necessity of 
clearing herself, Maiy, advised by Lord Herries, her best 
friend in England, agreed to answer the charges against 
her, if the Scottish noblemen who made them would attend 
to maintain them before such English noblemen as Eliza- 
beth might appoint for that purpose. Accordingly, such 
an assembly, under the name of a conference, met, first at 
York, and afterwards at Hampton Court. In its presence 
Lord Lennox, Darnley’s father, openly charged Mary with 
the murder of his son; and whatever Mary’s friends may 
now say or write in her behalf, there is no doubt that, 
when her brother Murray produced against her a casket 
containing certain guilty letters and verses which he stated 
to have passed between her and Bothwell, she withdrew 
from the inquiry. Consequently, it is to be supposed that

she was then considered guilty by those Who had the best 
opportunities of judging of the truth, and that the feeling 
which afterwards arose ih her behalf was a very generous 
but not a Very reasonable otte. 

However, the Duke of Norfolk, ail honourable but 
rather weak nobleman, partly because Mary was capfcivat* 
ing, partly because he was ambitious, partly because he was 
over-persuaded by artful plotters against Elizabeth, Con- 
ceived a strong idea that he would like to marry the Queen 
of Scots — though he was a little frightened, too, by the 
letters in the casket. This idea being secretly encouraged 
by some of the noblemen of Elizabeth's court*, and even by 
the favourite Earl of Leicester (because it Was objected to 
by other favourites who were his rivals), Mary expressed 
her approval of it, and the King of France and the King of 
Spain are supposed to have done the same. It was not so 
quietly planned, though, but that it Came to Elizabeth's 
ears, who warned the duke “to be Careful what sort of 
pillow he was going to lay his head upon." He made a 
humble reply at the time; but turned sulky Soon after* 
wards, and, being considered dangerous, was sent to the 
Tower. 

Thus, from the moment of Mary’s coming to England 
she began to be the centre of plots and miseries, 

A rise of the Catholics in the north was the next of these, 
and it was only checked by many executions and much 
bloodshed. It Was followed by a great Conspiracy of the 
Pope and some of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe to de* 
pose Elizabeth, place Mary on the throne, and restore the 
unreformed religion. It is almost impossible to doubt that 
Mary knew and approved of this; and the Pope himself 
was so hot in the matter that he issued a bull, in which he 
openly called Elizabeth the “ pretended Queen " of England, 
excommunicated her, and excommunicated all her subjects 
who should continue to obey her. A Copy of this misera- 
ble paper got into London, and was found one morning 
publicly posted on the Bishop of London’s gate, A great 
nue and cry being raised, another copy was found in the 
chamber of a student of Lincoln's Inn, who confessed, hew- 
ing put upon the rack, that he had received It from one 
John Felton, a rich gehtleman who lived across the 
Thames, near Southwark. This John Felton, being put 
upon the rack too, confessed that he had posted the placard

on the Bishop’s gate. For this offence he was, within four 
days, taken to Saint Paul’s Churchyard, and there hanged 
and quartered. As to the Pope’s bull, the people by the 
Reformation having thrown off the Pope, did not care 
much, you may suppose, for the Pope’s throwing off them. 
It was a mere dirty piece of paper, and not half so power- 
ful as a street ballad. 

On the very day when Felton was brought to his trial, 
the poor Duke of Norfolk was released. It would have 
been well for him if he had kept away from the Tower 
evermore, and from the snares that had taken him there. 
But, even while he was in that dismal place he corresponded 
with Mary, and as soon as he was out of it, he began to 
plot again. Being discovered in correspondence with the 
Pope, with a view to a rising in England which should force 
Elizabeth to consent to his marriage with Mary and to repeal 
the laws against the Catholics, he was re-committed to the 
Tower and brought to trial. He was found guilty by the 
unanimous verdict of the Lords who tried him, and was 
sentenced to the block. 

It is very difficult to make out, at this distance of time, 
and between opposite accounts, whether Elizabeth really 
was a humane woman, or desired to appear so, or was fear- 
ful of shedding the blood of people of great name who were 
popular in the country. Twice she commanded and coun- 
termanded the execution of this duke, and it did not take 
place until five months after his trial. The scaffold was 
erected on Tower Hill, and there he died like a brave man. 
He refused to have his eyes bandaged, saying that he was 
not at all afraid of death; and he admitted the justice of 
his sentence, and was much regretted by the people. 

Although Mary had shrunk at the most important time 
from disproving her guilt, she was very careful never to do 
anything that would admit it. All such proposals as were 
made to her by Elizabeth for her release, required that ad- 
mission in some form or other, and therefore came to noth- 
ing. Moreover, both women being artful and treacherous, 
and neither ever trusting the other, it was not likely that 
they could ever make an agreement. So, the Parliament, 
aggravated by what the Pope had done, made new and 
strong laws against the spreading of the Catholic religion 
in England, and declared it treason in any one to say that 
the Queen and her successors were not the lawful sover-

eigns of England. It would have done more than this, 
but for Elizabeth’s moderation. 

Since the Reformation, there had come to be three great 
sects of religious people — or people who called themselves 
so — in England; that is to say, those who belonged to the 
Reformed Church, those who belonged to the Unreformed 
Church, and those who were called the Puritans, because 
they said that they wanted to have everything very pure 
and plain in all the Church service. These last were for 
the most part an uncomfortable people, who thought 
it highly meritorious to dress in a hideous manner, talk 
through their noses, and oppose all harmless enjoyments. 
But they were powerful too, and very much in earnest, and 
they were one and all the determined enemies of the Queen 
of Scots. The Protestant feeling in England was further 
strengthened by the tremendous cruelties to which Prot- 
estants were exposed in France and in the Netherlands. 
Scores of thousands of them were put to death in those 
countries with every cruelty that can be imagined, and at 
last, in the autumn of the year one thousand live hundred 
and seventy-two, one of the greatest barbarities ever com- 
mitted in the world took place at Paris. 

It is called in history, The Massacre of Saint Bar- 
tholomew, because it took place on Saint Bartholomew’s 
Eve. The day fell on Saturday the twenty-third of August. 
On that day all the great leaders of the Protestants (who 
were there called Huguenots) were assembled together, for 
the purpose, as was represented to them, of doing honour 
to the marriage of their chief, the young King of Navarre, 
with the sister of Charles the Ninth : a miserable young 
King who then occupied the French throne. This dull 
creature was made to believe by his mother and other fierce 
Catholics about him that the Huguenots meant to take his 
life; and he was persuaded to give secret orders that, on 
the tolling of a great bell, they should be fallen upon by 
an overpowering force of armed men, and slaughtered 
wherever they could be found. When the appointed hour 
was close at hand, the stupid wretch, trembling from head 
to foot, was taken into a balcony by his mother to see the 
atrocious work begun. The moment the bell tolled, the 
murderers broke forth. During all that night and the two 
next days, they broke into the houses, fired the houses, 
shot and stabbed the Protestants, men, women, and chil-

dren, and flung thei r bodies into the streets. They tret© 
shot at in the streets as they passed along, and their blood 
ran down the gutters. Upwards of ten thousand Protes- 
tants were killed in Paris alone; in all France four or five 
times that number. To return thanks to Heaven for these 
diabolical murders, the Pope and his train actually went in 
public procession at Rome, and as if this were not shame 
enough for them, they had a medal struck to commemorate 
the event. But, however comfortable the wholesale mur- 
ders were to these high authorities, they had not that sooth- 
ing effect upon the doll-King. I am happy to state that he 
never knew a moment’s peace afterwards; that he was con- 
tinually crying out that he saw the Huguenots covered with 
blood and wounds falling dead before him; and that he 
died within a year, shrieking and yelling and raving to that 
degree, that if all the Popes who had ever lived had been 
rolled into one, they would not have afforded His guilty 
Majesty the slightest consolation. 

When the terrible news of the massacre arrived in Eng- 
land, it made a powerful impression indeed upon the peo- 
ple. If they began to run a little wild against the Catho- 
lics at about this time, this fearful reason for it, Coming 
so soon after the days of bloody Queen Mary, must be re- 
membered in their excuse. The Court was not quite so 
honest as the people— but perhaps it sometimes is not. It 
received the French ambassador, with all the lords and 
ladies dressed in deep mourning, and keeping a profound 
silence. Nevertheless, a proposal of marriage which he had 
made to Elizabeth only two days before the eve of Saint 
Bartholomew, on behalf of the Duke of Alenqon, the French 
King’s brother, a boy of seventeen, still went on; while on 
the other hand, in her usual crafty way, the Queen secretly 
supplied the Huguenots with money and weapons. 

I must say that for a Queen who made all those fine 
speeches, of which I have confessed myself to be rather 
tired, about living and dying a Maiden Queen, Elizabeth 
was “ going 99 to be married pretty often. Besides always 
having some English favourite or other whom she by turns 
encouraged and swore at and knocked about — for the Maiden 
Queen was very free with her fists — she held this French 
duke off and on through several years. When he at last 
came over to England, the marriage articles were actually 
drawn up, and it was Settled that the wedding should take

place in six weeks. The Queen was then so bent upon It, 
that she prosecuted a poor Puritan named Stubbs, and a 
poor bookseller named Page, for writing and publishing a 
pamphlet against it. Their right hands were chopped off 
for this crime ; and poor Stubbs— more loyal than I should 
have been myself under the eircumstanoes— immediately 
pulled off his bat with his left hand, and cried, “ God save 
the Queen I ” Stubbs was cruelly treated ? for the marriage 
never took place after all, though the Queen pledged her- 
self to the duke with a ring from her own finger. He went 
away, no better than he came, when the courtship had 
lasted some ten years altogether ; and he died a couple of 
years afterwards, mourned by Elizabeth, who appears to 
have been really fond of him. It is not much to her credit, 
for he was a bad enough member of a bad family. 

To return to the Catholics. There arose two orders 
of priests, who were very busy in England, and who were 
much dreaded. These were the J esuits (who were every- 
where in all sorts of disguises), and the Seminary Priests. 
The people had a great horror of the first, because they 
were known to have taught that murder was lawful if it 
were done with an object of which they approved j and they 
had a great horror of the second, because they oame to 
teach the old religion, and to be the successors of " Queen 
Mary’s priests,” as those yet lingering in England were 
called, when they should die out. The severest laws were 
made against them, and were most unmercifully executed. 
Those who sheltered them in their houses often suffered 
heavily for what was an act of humanity ; and the rack, 
that cruel torture which tore men’s limbs asunder, was con* 
stantly kept going. What these unhappy men confessed, 
or what was ever confessed by any one under that agony y 
must always be received with great doubt, as it is certain 
that people have frequently owned to the most absurd and 
impossible crimes to escape such dreadful suffering. But 
I cannot doubt it to have been proved by papers, that there 
were many plots, both among the Jesuits, and with France, 
and with Scotland, and with Spain, for the destruction of 
Queen Elizabeth, for the placing of Mary on the throne, 
and for the revival of the old religion. 

If the English people wfere too ready to believe in plots, 
there were, as I have said, good reasons for it. When the 
m&SBacre of Saint Bartholomew was yet fresh in their rec-

ollection, a great Protestant Dutch hero, the Prince op 
Orange, was shot by an assassin, who confessed that he 
had been kept and trained for the purpose in a college of 
Jesuits. The Dutch, in this surprise and distress, offered 
to make Elizabeth their sovereign, but she declined the 
honour, and sent them a small army instead, under the 
command of the Earl of Leicester, who, although a capital 
Court favourite, was not much of a general. He did so 
little in Holland, that his campaign there would probably 
have been forgotten, but for its occasioning the death of 
one of the best writers, the best knights, and the best gen- 
tlemen, of that or any age. This was Sir Philip Sidney, 
who was wounded by a musket ball in the thigh as he 
mounted a fresh horse, after having had his own killed un- 
der him. He had to ride back wounded, a long distance, 
and was very faint with fatigue and loss of blood, when 
some water, for which he had eagerly asked, was handed 
to him. But he was so good and gentle even then, that 
seeing a poor badly wounded common soldier lying on the 
ground, looking at the water with longing eyes, he said, 
“Thy necessity is greater than mine,” and gave it up to 
him. This touching action of a noble heart is perhaps as 
well known as any incident in history — it is as famous far 
and wide as the blood-stained Tower of London, with its 
axe, and block, and murders out of number. So delight- 
ful is an act of true humanity, and so glad are mankind to 
remember it. 

At home, intelligence of plots began to thicken every 
day. I suppose the people never did live under such con- 
tinual terrors as those by which they were possessed now, 
of Catholic risings, and burnings, and poisonings, and I 
don’t know what. Still, we must always remember that 
they lived near and close to awful realities of that kind, 
and that with their experience it was not difficult to believe 
in any enormity. The government had the same fear, and 
did not take the best means of discovering the truth — for, 
besides torturing the suspected, it employed paid spies, who 
will always lie for their own profit. It even made some of 
the conspiracies it brought to light, by sending false letters 
to disaffected people, inviting them to join in pretended 
plots, which they too readily did. 

But, one great real plot was at length discovered, and 
it ended the career of Mary Queen of Scots. A seminary

priest named Ballard, and a Spanish soldier named Say* 
agr, set on and encouraged by certain French priests, im- 
parted a design to one Anthony Babington — a gentleman 
of fortune in Derbyshire, who had been for some time a 
secret agent of Mary* s — for murdering the Queen. Babing- 
ton then confided the scheme to some other Catholic gen- 
tlemen who were his friends, and they joined in it heartily. 
They were vain weak-headed young men, ridiculously con- 
fident, and preposterously proud of their plan ; for they got 
a gimcrack painting made, of the six choice spirits who 
were to murder Elizabeth, with Babington in an attitude 
for the centre figure. Two of their number, however, one 
of whom was a priest, kept Elizabeth’s wisest minister, Sir 
Francis Walsingham, acquainted with the whole project 
from the first. The conspirators were completely deceived 
to the final point, when Babington gave Savage, because he 
was shabby, a ring from his finger, and some money from 
his purse, wherewith to buy himself new clothes in which 
to kill the Queen. Walsingham, having then full evidence 
against the whole band, and two letters of Mary’s besides, 
resolved to seize them. Suspecting something wrong, they 
stole out of the city, one by one, and hid themselves in 
Saint John’s Wood, and other places which really were 
hiding places then ; but they were all taken, and all executed. 
When they were seized, a gentleman was sent from Court to 
inform Mary of the fact, and of her being involved in the 
discovery. Her friends have complained that she was kept 
in very hard and severe custody. It does not appear 
very likely, for she was going out a hunting that very 
morning. 

Queen Elizabeth had been warned long ago, by one in 
France who had good information of what was secretly do- 
ing, that in holding Mary alive, she held “ the wolf who 
would devour her.” The Bishop of London had, more 
lately, given the Queen’s favourite minister the advice in 
writing, “forthwith to cut off the Scottish Queen’s head.” 
The question now was, what to do with her? The Earl of 
Leicester wrote a little note home from Holland, recom- 
mending that she should be quietly poisoned; that noble 
favourite having accustomed his mind, it is possible, to 
remedies of that nature. His black advice, however, was 
disregarded, and she was brought to trial at Fotheringay 
Castle in Northamptonshire, before a tribunal of J

composed of both religions. There, and in the Star Cham* 
her at Westminster, the trial lasted a fortnight. She de- 
fended herself with great ability, but could only deny the 
confessions that had been made by Babington and others; 
could only call her own letters, produced against her by 
her own secretaries, forgeries; and, in short, could only 
deny everything. She was found guilty, and declared to 
have incurred the penalty of death. The Parliament met, 
approved the sentence, and prayed the Queen to have it 
executed. The Queen replied that she requested them to 
consider whether no means could be found of saving Mary’s 
life without endangering her own. The Parliament re- 
joined, No; and the citizens illuminated their houses and 
lighted bonfires, in token of their joy that all these plots 
and troubles were to be ended by the death of the Queen of 
Scots, 

She* feeling sure that her time was now come, wrote a 
letter to the Queen of England, making three entreaties: 
first, that she might be buried in France ; secondly, that 
she might not be executed in secret, bat before her servants 
and some others ; thirdly, that after her death, her servants 
should not be molested, but should be suffered to go home 
with the legacies she left them. It was an affecting letter, 
and Elizabeth shed tears over it, but sent no answer. Then 
came a special ambassador from France, and another from 
Scotland, to intercede for Mary’s life; and then the nation 
begin to clamour, more and more, for her death. 

What the real feelings or intentions of Elizabeth were, 
can never be known now ; but I strongly suspect her of only 
wishing one thing more than Mary’s death, and that was to 
keep free of the blame of it. On the first of February, one 
thousand five hundred and eighty-seven, Lord Burleigh 
having drawn out the warrant for the execution, the Queen 
sent to the secretary Davison to bring it to her, that she 
might sign it : which she did. Next day, when Davison 
told her it was sealed, she angrily asked him why such 
haste was necessary? Next day but one, she joked about 
it, and swore a little. Again, next day but one, she 
seemed to complain that it was not yet done, but still she 
would not be plain with those about her. So, on the sev- 
enth, the Earls of Kent and Shrewsbury, with the Sheriff 
of Northamptonshire, came with the warrant to Fotherin- 
gay, to tell the Queen of Scots to prepare for death.

When those messengers of ill omen were gone, Mary 
made a frugal supper, drank to her servants, read over her 
wiU, went to bed, slept for some hours, and then arose and 
passed the remainder of the night saying prayers. In the 
morning she dressed herself in her best clothes; and, at 
eight o’clock when the sheriff came for her to her chapel, 
took leave of her servants who were there assembled pray- 
ing with her, and went down-stairs, carrying a Bible in one 
hand and a crucifix in the other. Two of her women and 
four of her men were allowed to be present in the hall; 
where a low scaffold, only two feet from the ground, was 
erected aild covered with black ; and where the executioner 
from the Tower, and his assistant, stood, dressed in black 
velvet. The hall was full of people. While the sentence 
was being read she sat upon a stool; and, when it was finr 
ished, she again denied her guilt, as she had done before. 
The Earl of Kent and the Dean of Peterborough, in their 
Protestant zeal, made some very unnecessary speeches to 
her ; to which she replied that she died in the Catholic relig- 
ion, and they need not trouble themselves about that 
matter. When her head and neck were uncovered by the 
executioners, she said that she had not been used to be un* 
dressed by such hands, or before so much company. 
FinaUy, one of her women fastened a cloth over her face, 
and she laid her neck upon the block, and repeated more 
than once in Latin, " Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend 
my spirit ! ” Some say her head was struck off in two 
blows, some say in three. However that be, when it was 
held up, streaming with blood, the real hair beneath the 
false hair she had long worn was seen to be as grey as that 
of a woman of seventy, though she was at that time only 
in her forty-sixth year. All her beauty was gone. 

But she was beautiful enough to her little dog, who cow* 
ered under her dress, frightened, when she went upon the 
scaffold, and who lay down beside her headless body when 
all her earthly sorrows were over.

On its being formally made known to Elizabeth that 
the sentence had been executed on the Queen of Scots, she

Tower ; from which place he was only released in the end 
by paying an immense fine which completely ruined him. 
Elizabeth not only over-acted her part in making these pre- 
tences, but most basely reduced to poverty one of her faith- 
ful servants for no other fault than obeying her commands. 

James, King of Scotland, Mary’s son, made a show like- 
wise of being very angry on the occasion ; but he was a 
pensioner of England to the amount of five thousand 
pounds a year, and he had known very little of his mother, 
and he possibly regarded her as the murderer of his father, 
and he soon took it quietly. 

Philip, King of Spain, however, threatened to do greater 
things than ever had been done yet, to set up the CathoHc 
religion and punish Protestant England. Elizabeth, head- 
ing that he and the Prince of Parma were making great 
preparations for this purpose, in order to be beforehand 
with them sent out Admiral Drake (a famous navigator, 
who had sailed about the world, and had already brought 
great plunder from Spain) to the port of Cadiz, where he 
burnt a hundred vessels full of stores. This great loss 
obliged the Spaniards to put off the invasion for a year ; 
but it was none the less formidable for that, amounting to 
one hundred and thirty ships, nineteen thousand soldiers*, 
eight thousand sailors, two thousand slaves, and between 
two and three thousand great guns. England was not idle 
in making ready to resist this great force. All the men 
between sixteen years old and sixty, were trained and 
drilled ; the national fleet of ships (in number only thirty- 
four at first) was enlarged by public contributions and by 
private ships, fitted out by noblemen ; the city of London, 
of its own accord, furnished double the number of shi ps 
and men that it was required to provide ; and, if ever the 
national spirit was up in England, it was up all through 
the country to resist the Spaniards. Some of the Queen’s 
advisers were for seizing the principal English Catholics, 
and putting them to death ; but the Queen — who, to her 
honour, used to say, that she would never believe any ill of 
her subjects, which a parent would not believe of her own 
children — rejected the advice, and only confined a few of 
those who were the most suspected, in the fens in Lincoln- 
shire. The great body of Catholics deserved this confi- 
dence ; for they behaved most loyally, nobly, and bravely. 

So, with all England firing up like one strong angry man*

and with both sides of the Thames fortified, and with the 
soldiers under arms, and with the sailors in their ships, the 
country waited for the coming of the proud Spanish fleet, 
which was called The Invincible Armada. The Queen 
herself, riding in armour on a white horse, and the Earl of 
Essex and the Earl of Leicester holding her bridle rein, 
made a brave speech to the troops at Tilbury Fort opposite 
Gravesend, which was received with such enthusiasm as is 
seldom known. Then came the Spanish Armada into the 
English Channel, sailing along in the form of a half moon, 
of such great size that it was seven miles broad. But the 
English were quickly upon it, and woe then to all the 
Spanish ships that dropped a little out of the half moon, 
for the English took them instantly ! And it soon appeared 
that the great Armada was anything but invincible, for on 
a summer night, bold Drake sent eight blazing fire-ships 
right into the midst of it. In terrible consternation the 
Spaniards tried to get out to sea, and so became dispersed ; 
the English pursued them at a great advantage ; a storm 
came on, and drove the Spaniards among rocks and shoals ; 
and the swift end of the invincible fleet was, that it lost 
thirty great ships and ten thousand men, and, defeated and 
disgraced, sailed home again. Being afraid to go by the 
English Channel, it sailed all round Scotland and Ireland ; 
some of the ships getting cast away on the latter coast in 
bad weather, the Irish, who were a kind of savages, plun- 
dered those vessels and killed their crews. So ended this 
great attempt to invade and conquer England. And I 
think it will be a long time before any other invincible fleet 
coming to England with the same object, will fare much 
better than the Spanish Armada. 

Though the Spanish King had had this bitter taste of 
English bravery, he was so little the wiser for it, as still to 
entertain his old designs, and even to conceive the absurd 
idea of placing his daughter on the English throne. 

But the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir 
Thomas Howard, and some other distinguished leaders, 
put to sea from Plymouth, entered the port of Cadiz once 
more, obtained a complete victory over the shipping assem- 
bled there, and got possession of the town. In obedience 
to the Queen’ 8 express instructions, they behaved with 
great humanity; and the principal loss of the. Spaniards 
was a vast sum of money which they had to pay for ran-

difficulty, and after an attempt to defend his house against 
the troops and cannon by which it was soon surrounded, 
gave himself up that night. He was brought to trial on 
the nineteenth, and found guilty; on the twenty-fifth, 
he was executed on Tower Hill, where he died, at thirty- 
four years old, both courageously and penitently. His 
step-father suffered with him. His enemy, Sir Walter 
Raleigh, stood near the scaffold all the time — but not so 
near it as we shall see him stand, before we finish his 
history. 

In this case, as in the cases of the Duke of Norfolk and 
Mary Queen of Scots, the Queen had commanded, and coun- 
termanded, and again commanded, the execution. It is 
probable that the death of her young and gallant favourite 
in the prime of his good qualities, was never off her mind 
afterwards, but she held out, the same vain obstinate and 
capricious woman, for another year. Then she danced be- 
fore her Court on a state occasion — and cut, I should think, 
a mighty ridiculous figure, doing so in an immense ruff, 
stomacher and wig, at seventy years old. For another 
year still, she held out, but, without any more dancing, and 
as a moody sorrowful broken creature. At last, on the 
tenth of March, one thousand six hundred and three, hav- 
ing been ill of a very bad cold, and made worse by the 
death of the Countess of Nottingham who was her intimate 
friend, she fell into a stupor and was supposed to be dead. 
She recovered her consciousness, however, and then noth- 
ing would induce her to go to bed ; for she said that she 
knew that if she did, she should never get up again. There 
she lay for ten days, on cushions on the floor, without any 
food, until the Lord Admiral got her into bed at last, partly 
by persuasions and partly by main force. When they asked 
her who should succeed her, she replied that her seat had 
been the seat of Kings, and that she would have for her 
successor, “No rascal’s son, but a King’s.” Upon this, 
the lords present stared at one another, and took the liberty 
of asking whom she meant; to which she replied, “ Whom 
should I mean, but our cousin of Scotland ! ” This was on 
the twenty-third of March. They asked her once again 
that day, after she was speechless, whether she was still 
in the same mind? She struggled up in bed, and joined 
her hands over her head in the form of a crown, as the 
only reply she could make. At three o’clock next morn-

ing, she very quietly died, in the forty-fifth year of her 
reign. 

That reign had been a glorious one, and is made for ever 
memorable by the distinguished men who flourished in it. 
Apart from the great voyagers, statesmen, and scholars, 
whom it produced, the names of Bacon, Spenser, and 
Shakespeare, will always be remembered with pride and 
veneration by the civilised world, and will always impart 
(though with no great reason, perhaps) some portion of 
their lustre to the name of Elizabeth herself. It was a 
great reign for discovery, for commerce, and for English 
enterprise and spirit in general. It was a great reign for 
the Protestant religion and for the Reformation which 
made England free. The Queen was very popular, and in 
her progresses, or journeys about her dominions, was every- 
where received with the liveliest joy. I think the truth is, 
that she was not half so good as she has been made out, 
and not half so bad as she has been made out. She had 
her fine qualities, but she was coarse, capricious, and treach- 
erous, and had all the faults of an excessively vain young 
woman long after she was an old one. On the whole, she 
had a great deal too much of her father in her, to please 
me. 

Many improvements and luxuries were introduced in the 
course of these five-and-forty years in the general manner 
of living ; but cock-fighting, bull-baiting, and bear-baiting, 
were still the national amusements ; and a coach was so 
rarely seen, and was such an ugly and cumbersome affair 
when it was seen, that even the Queen herself, on many 
high occasions, rode on horseback on a pillion behind the 
Lord- Chancellor.

greedy, dirty, cowardly, a great swearer, and the most con- 
ceited man on earth. His figure — what is commonly called 
rickety from his birth — presented a most ridiculous appear- 
ance, dressed in thick padded clothes, as a safeguard 
against being stabbed (of which he lived in continual fear), 
of a grase^green colour from head to foot, with a hunting- 
horn dangling at his side instead of a sword, and his hat 
and feather sticking over one eye, or hanging on the back 
of his head, as he happened to toss it on. He U9ed to loll 
on the becks of his favoorite courtiers, and slobber their 
faces, and kiss and pinch their cheeks; and the greatest 
favourite he ever had, used to sign himself in his letters to 
his royal master, His Majesty’s “ dog and slave,” and used 
to address his majesty as “his Sowship.” His majesty 
was the worst rider ever seen, and thought himself the 
best. He was one of the most impertinent talkers (in Hie 
broadest Scotch) ever heard, and boasted of being unan- 
swerable in all manner of argument. He wrote some of 
the most wearisome treatises ever read — among others, a 
book upon witchcraft, in which he was a devout believer — 
and thought himself a prodigy of authorship. He thought, 
and wrote, and said, that a king had a right to make and 
unmake what laws he pleased, and ought to be accountable 
to nobody on earth. This is the plain true character of 
the personage whom the greatest men about the Court 
praised and flattered to that degree, that I doubt if there 
be anything much more shameful in the annals of human 
nature. 

He came to the English throne with great ease. The 
miseries of a disputed succession had been felt so long, and 
so dreadfully, that he was proclaimed within a few hours 
of Elizabeth’s death, and was accepted by the nation, even 
without being asked to give any pledge that he would gov- 
ern well, or that he would redress crying grievances. He 
took a month td Come from Edinburgh to London ; and, by 
way of exercising his new power, hanged a pickpocket on 
the journey without any trial, and knighted everybody he 
could lay hold of. He made two hundred knights before 
he got to his palace in London, and seven hundred before 
he had been in it three months. He also shovelled sixty- 
two new peers into the House of Lords — and there was a 
pretty large sprinkling of Scotchmen among them, you may 
believe.

His Sowship's prime minister, Cecil (for I cannot do 
better than call his majesty what his favourite called him), 
was the enemy of Sir Walter Raleigh, and also of Sir 
Walter's political friend, Loro Cobham ; and his Sow- 
ship's first trouble was a plot originated by these two, and 
entered into by some others, with the old object of seizing 
the King and keeping him in imprisonment until he should 
change his ihinisters. There were Catholic priests in the 
plot, and there were Puritan noblemen too; for, although 
the Catholics and Puritans were strongly opposed to each 
other, they united at this time against his Sowship, because 
they knew that he had a design against both, after pretend- 
ing to be friendly to each; this design being to have only 
one high and convenient form of the Protestant religion, 
which everybody should be bound to belong to, whether 
they liked it or not. This plot was mixed up with smother, 
which may or may not have had Some reference to placing 
on the throne, at some time, the Lady Arabella Stuart; 
whose misfortune it was, to be the daughter of the younger 
brother of his Sowship' s father, but who was quite inno- 
cent of any part in the scheme. Sir Walter Raleigh was 
accused on the confession of Lord Cobham — a miserable 
creature, who said one thing at one time, and another thing 
at another time, and could be relied upon in nothing. 
The trial of Sir Walter Raleigh lasted from eight in the 
morning until nearly midnight; he defended himself with 
snch eloquence, genius, and spirit against all accusations, 
and against the insults of Coke, the Attorney -General — 
who according to the custom of the time,. foully abused him 
— that those who went there detesting the prisoner, came 
away admiring him, and declaring that anything so won- 
derful and so captivating was never heard. He was found 
guilty, nevertheless, and sentenced to death. Execution 
was deferred, and he was taken to the Tower. The two 
Catholic priests, less fortunate, were executed with the 
usual atrocity ; and Lord Cobham and two others were par- 
doned on the scaffold. His Sowship thought it wonder- 
fully knowing in him to surprise the people by pardoning 
these three at the very block ; but, blundering, and bun- 
gling, as usual, he had very nearly overreached himself. 
For, the messenger on horseback who brought the pardon, 
came so late, that he was pushed to the outside of the 
crowd, and was obliged to shout and roar but what he came

for. The miserable Cobham did not gain much by being 
spared that day, . He lived, both as a prisoner and a beg- 
gar, utterly despised, and miserably poor, for thirteen 
years, and then died in an old outhouse belonging to one of 
his former servants. 

This plot got rid of, and Sir Walter Raleigh safely shut 
up in the Tower, his Sowship held a great dispute with the 
Puritans on their presenting a petition to hifh, and had it 
all his own way — not so very wonderful, as he would talk 
continually, and would not hear anybody else — and filled 
the bishops with admiration* It was comfortably settled 
that there was to be only one form of religion, and that all 
men were to think exactly alike. But, although this was 
arranged two centuries and a half ago, and although the 
arrangement was supported by much fining and imprison- 
ment, I do not find that it is quite successful, even yet. 

His Sowship, having that uncommonly high opinion of 
himself as a lung, had a very low opinion of Parliament as 
a power that audaciously wanted to control him. When 
he called his first Parliament after he had been king a year, 
he accordingly thought he would take pretty high ground 
with them, and told them that he commanded them “ as 
an absolute king.” The Parliament thought those strong 
words, and saw the necessity of upholding their authority. 
His Sowship had three children: Prince Henry, Prince 
Charles, and the Princess Elizabeth. It would have been 
well for one of these, and we shall soon see which, if he 
had learnt a little wisdom concerning Parliaments from his 
father’s obstinacy. 

Now, the people still labouring under their old dread of 
the Catholic religion, this Parliament revived and strength- 
ened the severe laws against it. And this so angered 
Robert Catesby, a restless Catholic gentleman of an old 
family, that he formed one of the most desperate and ter- 
rible designs ever conceived in the mind of man ; no less a 
scheme than the Gunpowder Plot. 

His object was, when the King, lords, and commons 
should be assembled at the next opening of Parliament, to 
blow them up, one and all, with a great mine of gunpow- 
der. The first person to whom he confided this horrible 
idea was Thomas Winter, a Worcestershire gentleman who 
had served in the army abroad, and had been secretly em- 
ployed in Catholic projects. While Winter was yet un-

decided, and when he had gone over to the Netherlands, 
to learn from the Spanish ambassador there whether there 
was any hope of Catholics being relieved through the 
intercession of the King of Spain with his Sowship, he 
found at Ostend a tall dark daring man, whom he had 
known when they were both soldiers abroad, and whose 
name was Guido — or Guy — Fawkes. Resolved to join 
the plot, he proposed it to this man, knowing him to 
be the man for any desperate deed, and they two came 
back to England together. Here, they admitted two 
other conspirators : Thomas Percy, related to the Earl 
of Northumberland, and John Wright, his brother- 
in-law. All these met together in a solitary house in the 
open fields which were then near Clement’s Inn, now a 
closely blocked-up part of London ; and when they had all 
taken a great oath of secrecy, Catesby told the rest what 
his plan was. They then went up-stairs into a garret, and 
received the Sacrament from Father Gerard, a Jesuit, 
who is said not to have known actually of the Gunpowder 
Plot, but who, I think, must have had his suspicions that 
there was something desperate afoot. 

Percy was a Gentleman Pensioner, and as he had occa- 
sional duties to perform about the Court, then kept at 
Whitehall, there would be nothing suspicious in his living 
at Westminster. So, having looked well about him, and 
having found a house to let, the back of which joined the 
Parliament House, he hired it of a person named Ferris, 
for the purpose of undermining the wall. Having got pos- 
session of this house, the conspirators hired another on the 
Lambeth side of the Thames, which they used as a store- 
house for wood, gunpowder, and other combustible matters. 
These were to be removed at night (and afterwards were 
removed), bit by bit, to the house at Westminster; and, 
that there might be some trusty person to keep watch over 
the Lambeth stores, they admitted another conspirator, by 
name Robert Kay, a very poor Catholic gentleman. 

All these arrangements had been made some months, and 
it was a dark wintry December night, when the conspira- 
tors, who had been in the meantime dispersed to avoid 
observation, met in the house at Westminster, and began 
to dig. They had laid in a good stock of eatables, to avoid 
going in and out, and they dug and dug with great ardour. 
But, the wall being tremendously thick, and the work very

severe, they took into their plot Christopher Wright, a 
younger brother of John Wright, that they might have a 
new pair of hands to help. And Christopher Wright fell 
to like a fresh man, and they dug and dug by night and by 
day, and Fawkes stood sentinel all the time. And if any 
man’s heart seemed to fail him at all, Fawkes said, “ Gen- 
tlemen, we have abundance of powder and shot here, and 
there is no fear of our being taken alive, even if discovered." 
The same Fawkes, who, in the capacity of sentinel, was 
always prowling about, soon picked up the intelligence that 
the King had prorogued the Parliament again, from the 
seventh of February, the day first fixed upon, until the 
third of October. When the conspirators knew this, they 
agreed to separate until after the Christmas holidays, and 
to take no notice of each other in the meanwhile, and never 
to write letters to one another on any account. So, the 
house in Westminster was shut up again, and I suppose 
the neighbours thought that those strange looking men who 
lived there so gloomily, and went out so seldom, were gone 
away to have a merry Christmas somewhere. 

It was the beginning of February, sixteen hundred and 
five, when Catesby met his fellow-conspirators again at 
this Westminster house. He had now admitted three more ; 
John Grant, a Warwickshire gentleman of a melancholy 
temper, who lived in a doleful house near Stratford-upon- 
Avon, with a frowning wall all round it, and a deep moat; 
Robert Winter, eldest brother of Thomas ; and Catesby ’s 
own servant, Thomas Bates, who, Catesby thought, had 
had some suspicion of what his master was about. These 
three had all suffered more or less for their religion in 
Elizabeth’s time. And now, they all began to dig again, 
and they dug and dug by night and by day. 

They found it dismal work alone there, underground, 
with such a fearful secret on their minds, and bo many 
murders before them. They were filled with wild fancies. 
Sometimes, they thought they heard a great bell tolling, 
deep down in the earth under the Parliament House ; some- 
times, they thought they heard low voices muttering about 
the Gunpowder Plot ; once in the morning, they really did 
hear a great rumbling noise over their heads, as they dug 
and sweated in their mine. Every man stopped and looked 
aghast at his neighbour, wondering what had happened, 
when that bold prowler, Fawkes, who had been out to look,

came in and told them that it was only a dealer in coals 
who had occupied a cellar under the Parliament House, re- 
moving his stock in trade to some other place. Upon this, 
the conspirators, who with all their digging and digging 
had not yet dug through the tremendously thick wall, 
changed their plan; hired that cellar, which was directly 
under the House of Lords; put six-and-thirty barrels of 
gunpowder in it, and covered them over with fagots and 
coals. Then they all dispersed again till September, when 
the following new conspirators were admitted: Sir Ed- 
ward Baynham, of Gloucestershire ; Sir Everard Digby, 
of Rutlandshire ; Ambrose Rookwood, of Suffolk ; Francis 
Tresham, of Northamptonshire. Most of these were rich, 
and were to assist the plot, some with money and some 
with horses on which the conspirators were to ride through 
the country and rouse the Catholics after the Parliament 
should be blown into air. 

Parliament being again prorogued from the third of Oc- 
tober to the fifth of November, and the conspirators being 
uneasy lest their design should have been found out, 
Thomas Winter said he would go up into the House of 
Lords on the day of the prorogation, and see how matters 
looked. Nothing could be better. The unconscious com- 
missioners were walking about and talking to one another, 
just over the six-and-thirty barrels of gunpowder. He 
eame back and told the rest so, and they went on with their 
preparations. They hired a ship, and kept it ready in the 
Thames, in which Fawkes was to sail for Flanders after 
firing with a slow match the train that was to explode the 
powder. A number of Catholic gentlemen not in the secret, 
were invited, on pretence of a hunting party, to meet Sir 
Everard Digby at Dud church on the fatal day, that they 
might be ready to act together. And now all was ready. 

But, now, the great wickedness and danger which had 
been all along at the bottom of this wicked plot, began to 
show itself. As the fifth of November drew near, most of 
the conspirators, remembering that they had friends and 
relations who would be in the House of Lords that day, 
felt some natural relenting, and a wish to warn them to 
keep away. They were not much comforted by Cafcesby’s 
declaring that in such a cause he would blow up his own 
son. Lord Mounteagle, Tresham’ s brother-in-law, was 
certain to be in the house ; and when Tresham found that

he could not prevail upon the rest to devise any means of 
sparing their friends, he wrote a mysterious letter to this 
lord and left it at his lodging in the dusk, urging him to 
keep away from the opening of Parliament, “ since God 
and man had concurred to punish the wickedness of the 
times.” It contained the words “that the Parliament 
should receive a terrible blow, and yet should not see who 
hurt them.” And it added, “the danger is past, as soon 
as you have burnt the letter.” 

The ministers and courtiers made out that his Sowship, 
by a direct miracle from Heaven, found out what this let- 
ter meant. The truth is, that they were not long (as few 
men would be) in finding out for themselves ; and it was 
decided to let the conspirators alone, until the very day 
before the opening of Parliament. That the conspirators 
had their fears, is certain ; for, Tresham himself said be- 
fore them all, that they were every one dead men ; and, 
although even he did not take flight, there is reason to sup- 
pose that he had warned other persons besides Lord Mount- 
eagle. However, they were all firm; and Fawkes, who 
was a man of iron, went down every day and night to keep 
watch in the cellar as usual. He was there about two in 
the afternoon of the fourth, when the Lord Chamberlain 
and Lord Mounteagle threw open the door and looked in. 
“ Who are you, friend? ” said they. “ Why,” said Fawkes, 
“ I am Mr. Percy’s servant, and am looking after his store 
of fuel here.” “Your master has laid in a pretty good 
store,” they returned, and shut the door, and went away. 
Fawkes, upon this, posted off to the other conspirators to 
tell them all was quiet, and went back and shut himself up 
in the dark black cellar again, where he heard the bell go 
twelve o’clock and usher in the fifth of November. About 
two hours afterwards, he slowly opened the door, and came 
out to look about him, in his old prowling way. He was 
instantly seized and bound, by a party of soldiers under 
Sir Thomas Knevett. He had a watch upon him, some 
touchwood, some tinder, some slow matches; and there 
was a dark lantern with a candle in it, lighted, behind the 
door. He had his boots and spurs on — to ride to the ship, 
I suppose — and it was well for the soldiers that they took 
him so suddenly. If they had left him but a moment’s 
time to light a match, he certainly would have tossed it in 
among the powder, and blown up himself and them.

They took him to the King’s bed-chamber first of all, 
and there the King (causing him to be held very tight, and 
keeping a good way off), asked him how he could have the 
heart to intend to destroy so many innocent people? “ Be- 
cause,” said Guy Fawkes, “ desperate diseases need desper- 
ate remedies.” To a little Scotch favourite, with a face 
like a terrier, who asked him (with no particular wisdom) 
why he had collected so much gunpowder, he replied, be- 
cause he had meant to blow Scotchmen back to Scotland, 
and it would take a deal of powder to do that. Next day 
he was carried to the Tower, but would make no confession. 
Even after being horribly tortured, he confessed nothing 
that the Government did not already know ; though he 
must have been in a fearful state — as his signature, still 
preserved, in contrast with his natural handwriting before 
he was put upon the dreadful rack, most frightfully shows. 
Bates, a very different man, soon said the Jesuits had had 
to do with the plot, and probably, under the torture, would 
as readily have said anything. Tresham, taken and put in 
the Tower too, made confessions and unmade them, and 
died of an illness that was heavy upon him. Rookwood, 
who had stationed relays of his own horses all the way to 
Dunchurch, did not mount to escape until the middle of 
the day, when the news of the plot was all over London. 
On the road, he came up with the two Wrights, Catesby, 
and Percy; and they all galloped together into Northamp- 
tonshire. Thence to Dunchurch, where they found the 
proposed party assembled. Finding, however, that there 
had been a plot, and that it had been discovered, the party 
disappeared in the course of the night, and left them alone 
with Sir Everard Digby. Away they all rode again, 
through Warwickshire and Worcestershire, to a house called 
Holbeach, on the borders of Staffordshire. They tried 
to raise the Catholics on their way, but were indignantly 
driven off by them. All this time they were hotly pursued 
by the sheriff of Worcester, and a fast increasing concourse 
of riders. At last, resolving to defend themselves at Hol- 
beach, they shut themselves up in the house, and put some 
wet powder before the fire to dry. But it blew up, and 
Catesby was singed and blackened, and almost killed, and 
some of the others were sadly hurt. Still, knowing that 
they must die, they resolved to die there, and with only 
their Bwords in their hands appeared at the windows to be

shot at by the sheriff and his assistants. Catesby said to 
Thomas Winter, after Thomas had been hit in the right 
arm which dropped powerless by his side* " Stand by me, 
Tom, and we will die together !” — which they did, being 
shot through the body by two bullets from one gun. John 
Wright, and Christopher Wright, and Percy, were also 
shot. Rookwood and Digby were taken : the former with 
a broken arm and a wound in his body too* 

It was the fifteenth of January, before the trial of Guy 
Fawkes, and such of the other conspirators as were left 
alive, came on. They were all found guilty, all hanged, 
drawn, and quartered : some, in Saint Paul’s Churchyard, 
on the top of Lud gate-hill ; some, before the Parliament 
House. A Jesuit priest, named Henry Garnet, to whom 
the dreadful design was said to have been communicated, 
was taken and tried ; and two of his servants, as well as a 
poor priest who was taken with him, were tortured with- 
out mercy. He himself was not tortured, but was sur- 
rounded in the Tower by tamperers and traitors, and so 
was made unfairly to convict himself out of his own mouth. 
He said, upon his trial, that he had done all he could to 
prevent the deed, and that he could not make public what 
had been told him in confession — though I am afraid he 
knew of the plot in other ways. He was found guilty and 
executed, after a manful defence, and the Catholic Church 
made a saint of him ; some rich and powerful persons, who 
had had nothing to do with the project, were fined and im- 
prisoned for it by the Star Chamber ; the Catholics, in gen- 
eral, who had recoiled with horror from the idea of the 
infernal contrivance, were unjustly put under more severe 
laws than before ; and this was the end of the Gunpowder 
Plot. 

SECOND PART. 

His Sowship would pretty willingly, I think, have blown 
the House of Commons into the air himself ; for, his dread 
and jealousy of it knew no bounds all through his reign. 
When he was hard pressed for money he was obliged to 
order it to meet, as he could get no money without it; and 
when it asked him first to abolish some of the monopolies 
in necessaries of life which were a great grievance to the 
people, and to redress other public wrongs, he flew into a 
rage and got rid of it again* At one time he wanted it to

consent to the Union of England with Scotland, and quar- 
relled about that. At another time it wanted him to put 
down a most infamous Church abuse, called the High Com- 
mission Court, and he quarrelled with it about that. At 
another time it entreated him not to be quite so fond of his 
archbishops and bishops who made speeches in his praise 
too awful to be related, but to have some little considera- 
tion for the poor Puritan clergy who. were persecuted for 
preaching in their own way, and not according to the arch- 
bishops and bishops; and they quarrelled about that. In 
short, what with hating the House of Commons, and pre- 
tending not to hate it ; and what with now sending some 
of its members who opposed him, to Newgate or to the 
Tower, and now telling the rest that they must not presume 
to make speeches about the public affairs which could not 
possibly concern them 5 and what with cajoling, and bully- 
ing, and frightening, and being frightened ; the House of 
Commons was the plague of his Sowship* s existence. It 
was pretty firm, however, in maintaining its rights, and 
insisting that the Parliament should make the laws, and 
not the King by his own single proclamations (which he 
tried hard to do) ; and his Sowship was so often distressed 
for money, in consequence, that he sold every sort of title 
and public office as if they were merchandise, and even in- 
vented a new dignity called a Baronetcy, which anybody 
could buy for a thousand pounds. 

These disputes with his Parliaments, and his hunting, 
and his drinking, and his lying in bed — for he was a great 
sluggard— occupied his Sowship pretty well The rest of 
his time he chiefly passed in hugging and slobbering his 
favourites. The first of these was Sir Philip Herbert, 
who had no knowledge whatever, except of dogs, and 
horses, and hunting, but whom he soon made Earl of 
Montgomery. The next, and a much more famous one, 
was Robert Carr, or Ker (for it is not certain which was 
his right name), who came from the Border country, and 
whom he soon made Viscount Rochester, and afterwards, 
Earl of Somerset. The way in which his Sowship doted 
on this handsome young man, is even more odious to think 
of, than the way in which the really great men of England 
condescended to bow down before him. Theh favourite’s 
great friend was a certain Sir Thomas Overbury, who wrote 
his love-letters for him, and assisted him in the duties of his

many high places, which his own ignorance prevented him 
from discharging. But this same Sir Thomas having just 
manhood enough to dissuade the favourite from a wicked 
marriage with the beautiful Countess of Essex, who was to 
get a divorce from her husband for the purpose, the said 
Countess, in her rage, got Sir Thomas put into the Tower, 
and there poisoned him. Then the favourite and this ‘bad 
woman were publicly married by the King’s pet bishop, 
with as much to-do and rejoicing, as if he had been the 
best man, and she the best woman, upon the face of the 
earth. 

But, after a longer sunshine than might have been ex- 
pected — of seven years or so, that is to say — another hand- 
some young man started up and eclipsed the Earl of 
Somerset. This was George Villiers, the youngest son 
of a Leicestershire ‘gentleman : who came to Court with all 
the Paris fashions on him, and could dance as well as the 
best mountebank that ever was seen. He soon danced 
himself into the good graces of his Sowship, and danced 
the other favourite out of favour. Then, it was all at 
once discovered that the Earl and Countess of Somerset 
had not deserved all those great promotions and mighty 
rejoicings, and they were separately tried for the murder 
of Sir Thomas Overbury, and for other crimes. .But, 
the King was so afraid of his late favourite’s publicly 
telling some disgraceful things he knew of him — which he 
darkly threatened to do — that he was even examined with 
two men standing, one on either side of him, each with a 
cloak in his hand, ready to throw it over his head and stop 
his mouth if he should break out with what he had it in 
his power to tell. So, a very lame affair was purposely 
made of the trial, and his punishment was an allowance of 
four thousand pounds a year in retirement, while the Count- 
ess was pardoned, and allowed to pass into retirement too. 
They hated one another by this time, and lived to revile 
and torment each other some years. 

While these events were in progress, and while his Sow- 
ship was making such an exhibition of himself, from day 
to day and from year to year, as is not often seen in any 
sty, three remarkable deaths took place in England. The 
first was that of the minister, Robert Cecil, Earl of Salis- 
bury, who was past sixty, and had never been strong, being 
deformed from his birth. He said at last that he had no

wish to live ; and no minister need have had, with his ex- 
perience of the meanness and wickedness of those disgrace- 
ful times. The second was that of the Lady Arabella 
Stuart, who alarmed his Sowship mightily, by privately 
marrying William Seymour, son of Lord Beauchamp, 
who was a descendant of King Henry the Seventh, and 
who, his Sowship thought, might consequently increase 
and strengthen any claim she might one day set up to the 
throne. She was separated from her husband (who was 
put in the Tower) and thrust into a boat to be confined at 
Durham. She escaped in a man’s dress to get away in a 
French ship from Gravesend to France, but unhappily 
missed her husband, who had escaped too, and was soon 
taken. She went raving mad in the miserable Tower, and 
died there after four years. The last, and the most impor- 
tant of these three deaths, was that of Prince Henry, the 
heir to the throne, in the nineteenth year of his age. He 
was a promising young prince, and greatly liked ; a quiet 
well-conducted youth, of whom two very good things are 
known : first, that his father was jealous of him ; secondly, 
that he was the friend of Sir Walter Raleigh, .languishing 
through all those years in the Tower, and often said that 
no man but his father would keep such a bird in such a 
cage. On the occasion of the preparations for the marriage 
of his sister the Princess Elizabeth with a foreign prince 
(and an unhappy marriage it turned out), he came from 
Richmond, where he had been very ill, to greet his new 
brother-in-law, at the palace at Whitehall. There he 
played a great game at tennis, in his shirt, though it 
was very cold weather, and was seized with an alarming 
illness, and died within a fortnight of a putrid fever. 
For this young prince Sir Walter Raleigh wrote, in his 
prison in the Tower, the beginning of a History of the 
World : a wonderful instance how little his Sowship could 
do to confine a great man’s mind, however long he might 
imprison his body. 

And this mention of Sir Walter Raleigh, who had many 
faults, but who never showed so many merits as in trouble 
and adversity, may bring me at once to the end of his sad 
story. After an imprisonment in the Tower of twelve long 
years, he proposed to resume those old sea voyages of his, 
and to go to South America in search of gold. His Sow- 
ship, divided between his wish to be on good terms with

the Spaniards through whose territory Sir Walter must 
pass (he had long had an idea of marrying Prince Henry 
to a Spanish Princess), and his avaricious eagerness to get 
hold of the gold, did not know what to do. But, in the 
end, he set Sir Walter free, taking securities for his return ; 
and Sir Walter fitted out an expedition at his own cost, 
and, on the twenty-eighth of March, one thousand six hun- 
dred and seventeen, sailed away in command of one of its 
ships, which he. ominously called the Destiny. The expe- 
dition failed ; the common men, not finding the gold they 
had expected, mutinied ; a quarrel broke out between Sir 
Walter and the Spaniards, who hated him for old suc- 
cesses of his against them ; and he took and burnt a little 
town called Saint Thomas. For this he was denounced 
to his Sowship by the Spanish ambassador as a pirate ; and 
returning almost broken-hearted, with his hopes and for- 
tunes shattered, his company of friends dispersed, and his 
brave son (who had been one of them) killed, he was taken 
— through the treachery of Sih Lewis Stukely, his near 
relation, a scoundrel and a Vice- Admiral — and was once 
again immured in his prison-home of so many years. 

His Sowship being mightily disappointed in not getting 
any gold, Sir Walter Raleigh was tried as unfairly, and 
with as many lies and evasions as the judges and law 
officers and every other authority in Church and State 
habitually practised under such a King. After a great 
deal of prevarication on all parts but his own, it was de- 
clared that he must die under his former sentence, now fif- 
teen years old. So, on the twenty-eighth of October, one 
thousand six hundred and eighteen, he was shut up in the 
Gate House at Westminster to pass his last night on earth, 
and there he took leave of his good and faithful lady who 
was worthy to have lived in better days. At eight o’clock 
next morning, after a cheerful breakfast, and a pipe, and 
a cup of good wine, he was taken to Old Palace Yard in 
Westminster, where the scaffold was set up, and where so 
many people of high degree were assembled to see him die, 
that it was a matter of some difficulty to get him through 
the crowd. He behaved most nobly, but if anything lay 
heavy on his mind, it was that Earl of Essex, whose head 
he had seen roll off ; and he solemnly said that he had had 
no hand in bringing him to the block, and that he had shed 
tears for him when he died. As the morning was very

cold, the Sheriff said, would he come down to a fire for a 
little space, and warm himself? But Sir Walter thanked 
him, and said no, he would rather it were done at once, for 
he was ill of fever and ague, and in another quarter of an 
hour his shaking fit would come upon him if he were still 
alive, and his enemies might then suppose that he trembled 
for fear. With that, he kneeled and made a very beauti- 
ful and Christian prayer. Before he laid his head upon 
the block he felt the edge of the axe, and said, with a smile 
upon his face, that it was a sharp medicine, but would cure 
the worst disease. When he was bent down ready for 
death, he said to the executioner, finding that he hesitated, 
“ What dost thou fear? Strike, man ! 99 So, the axe came 
down and struck his head off, in the sixty-sixth year of his 
age. 

The new favourite got on fast. He was made a viscount, 
he was made Duke of Buckingham, he was made a mar- 
quis, he was made Master of the Horse, he was made Lord 
High Admiral — and the Chief Commander of the gallant 
English forces that had dispersed the Spanish Armada, 
was displaced to make room for him. He had the whole 
kingdom at his disposal, and his mother sold all the profits 
and honours of the State, as if she had kept a shop. He 
blazed all over with diamonds and other precious stones, 
from his hatband and his earrings to his shoes. Yet he 
was an ignorant presumptuous swaggering compound of 
knave and fool, with nothing but his beauty and his dan- 
cing to recommend him. This is the gentleman who called 
himself his Majesty’s dog and slave, and called his Majesty 
Your Sowship. His Sowship called him Steenie ; it is 
supposed, because that was a nickname for Stephen, and 
because Saint Stephen was generally represented in pic- 
tures as a handsome saint. 

His Sowship was driven sometimes to his wits’ -end by 
His trimming between the general dislike of the Catholic 
religion at home, and his desire to wheedle and flatter it 
abroad, as his only means of getting a rich princess for his 
son’s wife: apart of whose fortune he might cram into 
his greasy pockets. Prince Charles — or as his Sowship 
called him, Baby Charles — being now Prince of Wales, 
the old project of a marriage with the Spanish King’s 
daughter had been revived for him ; and as she could not 
marry a Protestant without leave from the Pope, his Sow-

ship himself secretly and meanly wrote to his InfaUibility, 
asking for it. The negotiation for this Spanish marriage 
takes up a larger space in great books, than you can imag- 
ine, but the upshot of it all is, that when it had been held 
off by the Spanish Court for a long time, Baby Charles and 
Steenie set off in disguise as Mr. Thomas Smith and Mr. 
John Smith, to see the Spanish Princess ; that Baby Charles 
pretended to be desperately in love with her, and jumped 
off walls to look at her, and made a considerable fool of 
himself in a good many ways ; that she was called Prin- 
cess of Wales, and that the whole Spanish Court believed 
Baby Charles to be all but dying for her sake, as he ex- 
pressly told them he was ; that Baby Charles and Steenie 
came back to England, and were received with as much 
rapture as if they had been a blessing to it; that Baby 
Charles had actually fallen in love with Henrietta Maria, 
the French King’s sister, whom he had seen in Paris; that 
he thought it a wonderfully fine and princely thing to have 
deceived the Spaniards, all through; and that he openly 
said, with a chuckle, as soon as he was safe and sound at 
home again, that the Spaniards were great fools to have 
believed him. 

Like most dishonest men, the Prince and the favourite 
complained that the people whom they had deluded were 
dishonest. They made such misrepresentations of the 
treachery of the Spaniards in this business of the Spanish 
match, that the English nation became eager for a war with 
them. Although the gravest Spaniards laughed at the 
idea of his Sowship in a warlike attitude, the Parliament 
granted money for the beginning of hostilities, and the 
treaties with Spain were publicly declared to be at an end. 
The Spanish ambassador in London — probably with the 
help of the fallen favourite, the Earl of Somerset — being 
unable to obtain speech with his Sowship, slipped a paper 
into his hand, declaring that he was a prisoner in his own 
house, and was entirely governed by Buckingham and his 
creatures. The first effect of this letter was that his Sow- 
ship began to cry and whine, and took Baby Charles away 
from Steenie, and went down to Windsor, gabbling all sorts 
of nonsense. The end of it was that his Sowship hugged 
his dog and slave, and said he was quite satisfied. 

He had given the Prince and the favourite almost unlim- 
ited power to settle anything with the Pope as to the Span-

ish marriage ; and he now, with a view to the French one, 
signed a treaty that all Roman Catholics in England should 
exercise their religion freely, and should never be required 
to take any oath contrary thereto. In return for this, and 
for other concessions much less to be defended, Henrietta 
Maria was to become the Prince's wife, and was to bring 
him a fortune of eight hundred thousand crowns. 

His Sowship’s eyes were getting red with eagerly looking 
for the money, when the end of a gluttonous life came upon 
him ; and, after a fortnight's illness, on Sunday the twenty- 
seventh of March, one thousand six hundred and twenty- 
five, he died. He had reigned twenty-two years, and was 
fifty-nine years old. I know of nothing more abominable 
in history than the adulation that was lavished on this 
King, and the vice and corruption that such a barefaced 
habit of lying produced in his Court. It is much to be 
doubted whether one man of honour, and not utterly self- 
disgraced, kept his place near James the First. Lord Ba- 
con, that able and wise philosopher, as the First Judge in 
the Kingdom in this reign, became a public spectacle of 
dishonesty and corruption ; and in his base flattery of his 
Sowship, and in his crawling servility to his dog and slave, 
disgraced himself even more. But, a creature like his Sow- 
ship set upon a throne is like the Plague, and everybody 
receives infection from him. 


CHAPTER XXXIII. 

ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST. 

Babt Charles became Kino Charles the First, in the 
twenty-fifth year of his age. Unlike his father, he was 
usually amiable in his private character, and grave and 
dignified in his bearing ; but, like his father, he had mon- 
strously exaggerated notions of the rights of a king, and 
was evasive, and not to be trusted. If his word could have 
been relied upon, his history might have had a different 
end. 

His first care was to send over that insolent upstart, 
Buckingham, to bring Henrietta Maria from Paris to be his 
Queen j upon which occasion Buckingham — with his usual

audacity — made love to the young Queen of Austria, and 
was very indignant indeed with Cardinal Richelieu, the 
French Minister, for thwarting his intentions. The Eng- 
lish people were very well disposed to like their new Queen, 
aud to receive her with great favour when she came among 
them as a stranger. But, she held the Protestant religion 
in great dislike, and brought over a crowd of unpleasant 
priests, who made her do some very ridiculous things, and 
forced themselves upon the public notice in many disagree- 
able ways. Hence, the people soon came to dislike her, ami 
she soon came to dislike them ; and she did so much all 
through this reign in setting the King (who was dotingly 
fond of her) against his subjects, that it would have been 
better for him if she had never been bom. 

Now, you are to understand that King Charles the First 
—of his own determination to be a high and mighty King 
not to be called to account by anybody, and urged on by 
his Queen besides — deliberately set himself to put his Par- 
liament down and to put himself up. You are also to 
understand, that even in pursuit of this wrong idea (enough 
in itself to have ruined, any king) he never took a straight 
course, but always took a crooked one. 

He was bent upon war with Spain, though neither the 
House of Commons nor the people were quite clear as to 
the justice of that war, now that they began to think a lit- 
tle more about the story of the Spanish match. But the 
King rushed into it hotly, raised money by illegal means 
to meet its expenses, and encountered a miserable failure 
at Cadiz, in the very first year of his reign. An expedition 
to Cadiz had been made in the hope of plunder, but as it 
was not successful, it was necessary to get a grant of money 
from the Parliament; and when they met, in no very com- 
plying humour, the King told them, “to make haste to let 
him have it, or it would be the worse for themselves.” 

Not put in a more complying humour by this, they im- 
peached the King’s favourite, the Duke of Buckingham, as 
the cause (which he undoubtedly was) of many great pub- 
lic grievances and wrongs. The King, to save him, dis- 
solved the Parliament without getting the money he wanted ; 
and when the Lords implored him to consider and grant a 
little delay, he replied, “No, not one minute.” He then 
began to raise money for himself by the following means 
among others.

He levied certain duties called tonnage and poundage 
which had not been granted by the Parliament, and could 
lawfully be levied by no other power; he called upon the 
seaport towns to furnish, and to pay all the cost for three 
months of, a fleet of armed ships ; and he required the peo- 
ple to unite in lending him large sums of money, the repay- 
ment of which was very doubtful. If the poor people re- 
fused, they were pressed as soldiers or sailors ; if the gentry 
refused, they were sent to prison. Five gentlemen, named 
Sir Thomas Darnel, John Corbet, Walter Earl, John 
Heveningham, and Everard Hampden, for refusing 
were taken up by a warrant of the King’s privy council, 
and were sent to prison without any cause but the King’s 
pleasure being stated for their imprisonment. Then the 
question came to be solemnly tried, whether this was not a 
violation of Magna Charta, and an encroachment by the 
King on the highest rights of the English people. His 
lawyers contended No, because to encroach upon the rights 
of the English people would be to do wrong, and the King 
could do no wrong. The accommodating judges decided in 
favour of this wicked nonsense; and here was a fatal divi- 
sion between the King and the people. 

For all this, it became necessary to call another Parlia- 
ment. The people, sensible of the danger in which their 
liberties were, chose for it those who were best known for 
their determined opposition to the King; but still the 
King, quite blinded by his determination to carry every- 
thing before him, addressed them when they met, in a 
contemptuous manner, and just told them in so many words 
that he had only called them together because he wanted 
money. The Parliament, strong enough and resolute 
enough to know that they would lower his tone, cared little 
for what he said, and laid before him one of the great doc- 
uments of history, which is called the Petition of Right, 
requiring that the free men of England should no longer be 
called upon to lend the King money, and should no longer 
l)e pressed or imprisoned for refusing to do so ; further, that 
the free men of England should no longer be seized by the 
King’s special mandate or warrant, it being contrary to 
their rights and liberties and the laws of their country. 
At first the King returned an answer to this petition, in 
which he tried to shirk it altogether; but, the House of 
Commons then showing their determination to go on with

the impeachment of Buckingham the King in alarm returned 
an answer, giving his consent to all that was required of 
him. He not only afterwards departed from his word and 
honour on these ‘points, over and over again, but, at this 
very time, he did the mean and dissembling act of publish- 
ing his first answer and not his second — merely that the 
people might suppose that the Parliament had not got the 
better of him. 

That pestilent Buckingham, to gratify his own wounded 
vanity, had by this time involved the country in war with 
France, as well as with Spain. For such miserable causes 
and such miserable creatures are wars sometimes made! 
But he was destined to do little more mischief in this 
world. One morning, as he was going out of his house to 
his carriage, he turned to speak to a certain Colonel Fryer 
who was with him ; and he was violently stabbed with a 
knife, which the murderer left sticking in his heart. This 
happened in his hall. He had had angry words up-stairs, 
just before, with some French gentlemen, who were imme- 
diately suspected by his servants, and had a close escape 
from being set upon and killed. In the midst of the noise, 
the real murderer, who had gone to the kitchen and might 
easily have got away, drew his sword and cried out, “ I am 
the man ! ” His name was John Felton, a Protestant and 
a retired officer in the army. He said he had had no per- 
sonal ill-will to the duke, but had killed him as a curse to 
the country. He had aimed his blow well, for Bucking- 
ham had only had time to cry out, “ Villain ! ” and then he 
drew out the knife, fell against a table, and died. 

The Council made a mighty business of examining John 
Felton about this murder, though it was a plain case enough, 
one would think. He had come seventy miles to do it, he 
told them, and he did it for the reason he had declared; if 
they put him upon the rack, as that noble Marquis of 
Dorset whom he saw before him, had the goodness to 
threaten, he gave that marquis warning, that he would ac- 
cuse him as his accomplice ! The King was unpleasantly 
anxious to have him racked, nevertheless ; but as the judges 
now found out that torture was contrary to the law of Eng- 
land — it is a pity they did not make the discovery a little 
sooner — John Felton was simply executed for the murder 
he had done. A murder it undoubtedly was, and not in 
the least to be defended: though he had freed England

from one of the most profligate, contemptible, and base 
court favourites to whom it has ever yielded. 

A very different man now arose. This was Sir Thomas 
Wentworth, a Yorkshire gentleman, who had sat in Par- 
liament for a long time, and who had favoured arbitrary 
and haughty principles, but who had gone over to the peo: 
pie’s side on receiving offence from Buckingham. The 
King, much wanting such a man — for, besides being natu- 
rally favourable to the King’s cause, he had great abilities 
— made him first a Baron, and then a Viscount, and gave 
him high employment, and won him most completely. 

A Parliament, however, was still in existence, and was 
not to be won. On the twentieth of January, one thousand 
six hundred and twenty-nine, Sir J ohn Eliot, a great man 
who had been active in the Petition of Right, brought for- 
ward other strong resolutions against the King’s chief in- 
struments, and called upon the Speaker to put them to the 
vote. To this the Speaker answered, “ he was commanded 
otherwise by the King,” and got up to leave the chair — 
which, according to the rules of the House of Commons 
would have obliged it to adjourn without doing anything 
more — when two members, named Mr. Hollis and Mr. 
Valentine, held him down. A scene of great confusion 
arose among the members; and while many swords were 
drawn and flashing about, the King, who was kept in- 
formed of all that was going on, told the captain of his 
guard to go down to the House and force the doors. The 
resolutions were by that time, however, voted, and the 
House adjourned. Sir John Eliot and those two mem- 
bers who had held the Speaker down, were quickly sum- 
moned before the Council. As they claimed it to be their 
privilege not to answer out of Parliament for anything they 
had said in it, they were committed to the Tower. The 
King then went down and dissolved the Parliament, in a 
speech wherein he made mention of these gentlemen as 
“ Vipers ” — which did not do him much good that ever I 
have heard of. 

As they refused to gain their liberty by saying they were 
sorry for what they had done, the King, always remarkably 
unforgiving, never overlooked their offence. When they 
demanded to be brought up before the Court of King’s 
Bench, he even resorted to the meanness of having them 
moved about from prison to prison, so that the writs issued

for that purpose should not legally find them. At last 
they came before the court and were sentenced to heavy 
fines, and to be imprisoned during the King’s pleasure. 
When Sir John Eliot’s health had quite given way, and he 
so longed for change of air and scene as to petition for his 
release, the King sent back the answer (worthy of his 
Sowship himself) that the petition was not humble enough. 
When he sent another petition by his young son, in which 
he pathetically offered to go back to prison when his health 
was restored, if he might be released for its recovery, the 
King still disregarded it. When he died in the Tower, 
and his children petitioned to be allowed to take his body 
down to Cornwall, there to lay it among the ashes of his 
forefathers, the King returned for answer, “Let Sir John 
Eliot’s body be buried in the church of that parish where 
he died.” All this was like a very little King indeed, I 
think. 

And now, for twelve long year’s, steadily pursuing his 
design of setting himself up and putting the people down, 
the King called no Parliament; but ruled without one If 
twelve thousand volumes were written iii his praise (as 
a good many have been) it would still remain a fact, im- 
possible to be denied, that for twelve years King Charles 
the First reigned in England unlawfully and despotically, 
seized upon his subjects’ goods and money at his pleasure, 
and punished according to his unbridled will all who ven- 
tured to oppose him. It is a fashion with some people to 
think that this King’s career was cut short; but I must 
say myself that I think he ran a pretty long one. 

William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, was the 
King’ 8 right-hamd man in the religious part of the putting 
down of the people’s liberties. Laud, who was a sincere 
man, of large learning but small sense — for the two things 
8omtimes go together in very different quantities — though 
a Protestant, held opinions so near those of the Catholics, 
that the Pope wanted to make a Cardinal of him, if he 
would have accepted that favour. He looked upon vows, 
robes, lighted candles, images, and so forth, as amazingly 
important in religious ceremonies; and he brought in an 
immensity of bowing and candle-snuffing. He also regard- 
ed archbishops and bishops as a sort of miraculous persons, 
and was inveterate in the last degree againBt any who 
thought otherwise. Accordingly, he offered up thanks

to Heaven, and was in a state of much pious pleasure, 
when a Scotch clergyman named Leighton, was pilloried, 
whipped, branded in the cheek, and had one of his ears cut 
off and one of his nostrils slit, for calling bishops trumpery 
and the inventions of men. He originated on a Sunday 
morning the prosecution of William Prynne, a barrister 
who was of similar opinions, and who was fined a thousand 
pounds; who was pilloried; who had his ears out off on 
two occasions— one ear at a time— and who was imprisoned 
for life. He highly approved of the punishment of Doctor 
Bastwick, a physician; who was also fined a thousand 
pounds ; and who afterwards had his ears cut off, and was 
imprisoned for life* These were gentle methods of persua- 
sion, some will tell you : I think, they were rather calcu- 
lated to be alarming to the people. 

In the money part of the putting down of the people’s 
liberties, the King was equally gentle, as some will tell 
you : as I think, equally alarming. He levied those duties 
of tonnage and poundage, and increased them as he thought 
fit. He granted monopolies to companies of merchants on 
their paying him for them, notwithstanding the great com- 
plaints that had, for years and years, been made on the 
subject of monopolies. He fined the people for disobeying 
proclamations issued by his Sowship in direct violation of 
law. He revived the detested Forest laws, and took pri- 
vate property to himself as his forest right. Above all, he 
determined to have what was called Ship Money ; that is 
to say, money for the support of the fleet — not only from 
the seaports, but from all the counties of England : hav- 
ing found out that, in some ancient time or other, all the 
counties paid it. The grievance of this ship money being 
somewhat too strong, John Chambers, a citizen of London, 
refused to pay his part of it. For this the Lord Mayor 
ordered John Chambers to prison, and for that John Cham- 
bers brought a suit against the Lord Mayor. Lord Say, 
also, behaved like a real nobleman, and deolared he would 
not pay. But, the sturdiest and best opponent of the ship 
money was John Hampden, a gentleman of Buckingham- 
shire, who had sat among the 16 vipers” in the House of 
Commons when there was such a tiling, and who had been 
the bosom friend of Sir John Eliot. This case was tried 
before the twelve judges in the Court of Exchequer, and 
again the King’s lawyers said it was impossible that ship

money could be wrong, because the King could do no 
wrong, however hard he tried — and he really did try very 
hard during these twelve years. Seven of the judges said 
that was quite true, and Mr. Hampden was bound to pay : 
five of the judges said that was quite false, and Mr. Hamp- 
den was not bound to pay. So, the King triumphed (as 
he thought), by making Hampden the most popular man in 
England ; where matters were getting to that height now, 
that many honest Englishmen could not endure their coun- 
try, and sailed away across the seas to found a colony in 
Massachusetts Bay in America. It is said that Hampden 
himself and his relation Oliver Cromwell were going 
with a company of such voyagers, and were actually on 
board ship, when they were stopped by a proclamation, 
prohibiting sea captains to carry out such passengers with- 
out the royal license. But 0 ! it would have been well for 
the King if he had let them go ! 

This was the state of England. If Laud had been a mad- 
man just broke loose, he could not have done more mischief 
than he did in Scotland. In his endeavours (in which he 
was seconded by the King, then in person in that part of 
his dominions) to force his own ideas of bishops, and his 
own religious forms and ceremonies, upon the Scotch, he 
roused that nation to a perfect frenzy. They formed a sol- 
emn league, which they called The Covenant, for the pres- 
ervation of their own religious forms ; they rose in arms 
throughout the whole country ; they summoned all their 
men to prayers and sermons twice a day by beat of drum ; 
they sang psalms, in which they compared their enemies to 
all the evil spirits that ever were heard of ; and they sol- 
emnly vowed to smite them with the sword. At first the 
King tried force, then treaty, then a Scottish Parliament 
which did not answer at all. Then he tried the Earl of 
Strafford, formerly Sir Thomas Wentworth; who, as 
Lord Wentworth, had been governing Ireland. He, too, 
had carried it with a very high hand there, though to the 
benefit and prosperity of that country. 

Strafford and Laud were for conquering the Scottish peo- 
ple by force of arms. Other lords who were taken into 
council, recommended that a Parliament should at last be 
called ; to which the King unwillingly consented. So, on 
the thirteenth of April, one thousand six hundred and 
forty, that then strange sight, a Parliament, was seen at

Westminster. It is caUed the Short Parliament, for it 
lasted a very little while. While the members were all 
looking at one another, doubtful who would dare to speak, 
Mr. Pym arose and set forth all that the King had done 
unlawfully during the past twelve years, and what was the 
position to which England was reduced. This great exam- 
ple set, other members took courage and spoke the truth 
freely, though with great patience and moderation. The 
King, a little frightened, sent to say that if they would 
grant him a certain sum on certain terms, no more ship 
money should be raised. They debated the matter for two 
days ; and then, as they would not give him all he asked 
without promise or inquiry, he dissolved them. 

But they kuew very well that he must have a Parliament 
now; and he began to make that discovery too, though 
rather late in the day. Wherefore, on the twenty-fourth 
of September, being then at York with an army collected 
against the Scottish people, but his own men sullen and 
discontented like the rest of the nation, the King told the 
great Council of the Lords, whom he had called to meet 
him there, that he would summon another Parliament to 
assemble on the third of November. The soldiers of the 
Covenant had now forced their way into England and had 
taken possession of the northern counties, where the coals 
are got. As it would never do to be without coals, and as 
the King’s troops could make no head against the Covenant- 
ers so full of gloomy zeal, a truce was made, and a treaty 
with Scotland was taken into consideration. Meanwhile 
the northern counties paid the Covenanters to leave the 
coals alone, and keep quiet. 

We have now disposed of the Short Parliament. We 
have next to see what memorable things were done by the 
Long one. 

SECOND PART. 

The Long Parliament assembled on the third of Novem- 
ber, one thousand six hundred and forty-one. That day 
week the Earl of Strafford arrived from York, very sensible 
that the spirited and determined men who formed that Par- 
liament were no friends towards him, who had not only 
deserted the cause of the people, but who had on all occa- 
sions opposed himself to their liberties. The King told 
him, for his comfort, that the Parliament “ should not hurt

one hair of his head . 99 Bat, on the very next day Mr. 
Pym, in the House of Commons, and with great solemnity, 
impeached the Earl of Strafford as a traitor. He was im- 
mediately taken into custody and fell from his proud 
height. 

It was the twenty-second of March before he was brought 
to trial in Westminster Hall ; where, although he was very 
ill and suffered great pain, he defended himself with such 
ability and majesty, that it was doubtful whether he would 
not get the best of it. But on the thirteenth day of the 
trial, Pym produced in the House of Commons a copy of 
some notes of a council, found by young Sib Hakby Va ne 
in a red velvet cabinet belonging to his father (Secretary 
Vane, who sat at the council-table with the earl), in which 
Strafford had distinctly told the King that he was free 
from all rules and obligations of government, and might do 
with his people whatever he liked ; and in which he had 
added — “ You have an army in Ireland that you may em- 
ploy to reduce this kingdom to obedience.” It was not 
clear whether by the words “ this kingdom,” he had really 
meant England or Scotland ; but the Paliament contended 
that he meant England, and this was treason. At the 
same sitting of the House of Commons it was resolved to 
bring in a bill of attainder declaring the treason to have 
been committed : in preference to proceeding with the trial 
by impeachment, which would have required the treason to 
be proved. 

So, a bill was brought in at once, was carried through the 
House of Commons by a large majority, and was sent up to 
the House of Lords. While it was still uncertain whether 
the House of Lords would pass it and the King consent to 
it, Pym disclosed to the House of Commons that the King 
and Queen had both been plotting with the officers of the 
army to bring up the soldiers and control the Parliament, 
and also to introduce two hundred soldiers into the Tower 
of London to effect the earPs escape. The plotting with 
the army was revealed by one George Goring, the son of 
a lord of that name : a bad fellow who was one of the origi- 
nal plotters, and turned traitor. The King had actually 
given his warrant for the admission of the two hundred 
men into the Tower, and they would have got in too, but 
for the refusal of the governor — a sturdy Scotchman of the 
name of Balfour— to admit them. These matters being

S23 


made public, great numbers of people began to riot outside 
the Houses of Parliament, and to cry out for the execution 
of the Earl of Strafford, as one of the King’s chief instru- 
ments against them. The bill passed the House of Lords 
while the people were in this state of agitation, and was 
laid before the King for his assent, together with another 
bill declaring that the Parliament then assembled should 
not be dissolved or adjourned without their own consent. 
The King — not unwilling to save a faithful servant, though 
he had no great attachment for him — was in some doubt 
what to do; but he gave his consent to both bills, although 
he in his heart believed that the bill against the Earl of 
Strafford was unlawful and unjust. The Earl had written 
to him, telling him that he was willing to die for his sake. 
But he had not expected that his royal master would take 
him at his word quite so readily ; for, when he heard his 
doom, he laid his hand upon his heart, and said, “ Put not 
your trust in Princes ! ” 

The King, who never could be straightforward and plain, 
through one single day or through one single sheet of paper, 
wrote a letter to the Lords, and sent it by the young Prince 
of Wales, entreating them to prevail with the Commons 
that “ that unfortunate man should fulfil the natural course 
of his life in a close imprisonment.” In a postscript to the 
very same letter, he added, “ If he must die, it were char- 
ity to reprieve him till Saturday.” If there had been any 
doubt of his fate, this weakness and meanness would have 
settled it. The very next day, which was the twelfth of 
May, he was brought out to be beheaded on Tower Hill. 

Archbishop Laud, who had been so fond of having peo* 
pie’s ears cropped off and their noses slit, was now con- 
fined in the Tower too ; and when the earl went by his win- 
dow to his death, he was there, at his request, to give him 
his blessing. They had been great friends in the King’s 
cause, and the earl had written to him in the days of their 
power that he thought it would be an admirable thing to 
have Mr. Hampden publicly whipped for refusing to pay 
the ship money. However, those high and mighty doings 
were over now, and the earl went his way to death with 
dignity and heroism. The governor wished him to get into 
a coach at the Tower gate, for fear the people should tear 
him to pieces ; but he said it was all one to him whether he 
died by the axe or by the people’s hands. So, he walked,

with a firm tread and a stately look, and sometimes pulled 
off his hat to them as he passed along. They were pro- 
foundly quiet. He made a speech on the scaffold from 
some notes he had prepared (the paper was found lying 
there after his head was struck off), and one blow of the 
axe killed him, in the forty-ninth year of his age. 

This bold and daring act, the Parliament accompanied by 
other famous measures, all originating (as even this did) in 
the King’s having so grossly and so long abused his power. 
The name of Delinquents was applied to all sheriffs and 
other officers who had been concerned in raising the ship 
money, or any other money, from the people, in an unlaw- 
ful manner; the Hampden judgment was reversed; the 
judges who had decided against Hampden were called upon 
to give large securities that they would take such conse- 
quences as Parliament might impose upon them; and one 
was arrested as he sat in High. Court, and carried off to 
prison. Laud was impeached; the unfortunate victims 
whose ears had been cropped and whose noses had been 
slit, were brought out of prison in triumph ; and a bill was 
passed declaring that a Parliament should be called every 
third year, and that if the King and the King’s officers did 
not call it, the people should assemble of themselves and 
summon it, as of their own right and power. Great illu- 
minations and rejoicings took place over all these things, 
and the country was wildly excited. That the Parliament 
took advantage of this excitement and stirred them up by 
every means, there is no doubt; but you are always to re- 
member those twelve long years, during which the King had 
tried so hard whether he really could do any wrong or 
not. 

All this time there was a great religious outcry against 
the right of the Bishops to sit in Parliament; to which the 
Scottish people particularly objected. The English were 
divided on this subject, and, partly on this account and 
partly because they had had foolish expectations that the 
Parliament would be able to take off nearly all the taxes, 
numbers of them sometimes wavered and inclined towards 
the King. 

I believe myself, that if, at this or almost any other pe- 
riod of his life, the King could have been trusted by any 
man not out of his senses, he might have saved himself 
and kept his throne. But, on the English army being dis-

banded, he plotted with the officers again, as he had done 
before, and established the fact beyond all doubt by put- 
ting his signature of approval to a petition against the Par- 
liamentary leaders, which was drawn up by certain officers. 
When the Scottish army was disbanded, he went to Edin- 
burgh in four days — which was going very fast at that 
time — to plot again, and so darkly too, that it is difficult 
to decide what his whole object was. Some suppose that 
he wanted to gain over the Scottish Parliament, as he did 
in fact gain over, by presents and favours, many Scottish 
lords and men of power. Some think that he went to get 
proofs against the Parliamentary leaders in England of 
their having treasonably invited the Scottish people to 
come and help them. With whatever object he went to 
Scotland, he did little good by going. At the instigation 
of the Earl of Montrose, a desperate man who was then 
in prison for plotting, he tried to kidnap three Scottish 
lords who escaped. A committee of the Parliament at 
home, who had followed to watch him, writing an account 
of this Incident, as it was called, to the Parliament, the 
Parliament made a fresh stir about it; were, or feigned to 
be, much alarmed for themselves; and wrote to the Earl 
of Essex, the commander-in-chief, for a guard to protect 
them. 

It is not absolutely proved that the King plotted in Ire- 
land besides, but it is very probable that he did, and that 
the Queen did, and that he had some wild hope of gaining 
the Irish people over to his side by favouring a rise among 
them. Whether or no, they did rise in a most brutal and 
savage rebellion; in which, encouraged by their priests, 
they committed such atrocities upon numbers of the Eng- 
lish, of both sexes and of all ages, as nobody could believe, 
but for their being related on oath by eye-witnesses. 
Whether one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand 
Protestants were murdered in this outbreak, is uncertain; 
but, that it was as ruthless and barbarous an outbreak as 
ever was known among any savage people, is certain. 

The King came home from Scotland, determined to make 
a great struggle for his lost power. He believed that, 
through his presents and favours, Scotland would take no 
part against him; and the Lord Mayor of London received 
him with such a magnificent dinner that he thought he must 
have become popular again in England. It would take a

good many Lord Mayors, however, to make a people, and 
the King soon found himself mistaken. 

Not so soon, though, but that there was a great opposi- 
tion in the Parliament to a celebrated paper put forth by 
Pym and Hampden and the rest, called “The Remon- 
strance,” which set forth all the illegal acts that the King 
had ever done, but politely laid the blame of them on his 
bad advisers. Even when it was passed and presented to 
him, the King still thought himself strong enough to dis- 
charge Balfour from his command in the Tower, and to put 
in his place a man of bad character; to whom the Commons 
instantly objected, and whom he was obliged to abandon. 
At this time, the old outcry about the Bishops became 
louder than ever, and the old Archbishop of York was so 
near being murdered as he went down to the House of 
Lords — being laid hold of by the mob and violently knocked 
about, in return for very foolishly scolding a shrill boy 
who was yelping out “ No Bishops ! ” — that he sent for all 
the Bishops who were in town, and proposed to them to 
sign a declaration that, as they could no longer without 
danger to their lives attend their duty in Parliament, they 
protested against the lawfulness of everything done in their 
absence. This they asked the King to send to the House 
of Lords, which he did. Then the House of Commons im- 
peached the whole parly of Bishops and sent them off to 
the Tower. 

Taking no warning from this; but encouraged by there 
being a moderate party in the Parliament who objected to 
these strong measures, the King, on the third of January, 
one thousand six hundred and forty-two, took the rashest 
step that ever was taken by mortal man. 

Of his own accord and without advice, he sent the At- 
torney-General to the House of Lords, to accuse of treason 
certain members of Parliament who as popular leaders were 
the most obnoxious to him; Lord Kimbolton, Sir Ar- 
thur Haselrig, Denzil Hollis, John Pvm (they used 
to call him King Pym, he possessed such power and looked 
so big), John Hampden, and William Strode. The 
houses of those members he caused to be entered, and their 
papers to be sealed up. At the same time, he sent a mes- 
senger to the House of Commons demanding to have the 
five gentlemen who were members of that House immedi- 
ately produced. To this the House replied that they should

appear as soon as there was any legal charge against them, 
and immediately adjourned. 

Next day, the House of Commons send into the City to 
let the Lord Mayor know that their privileges are invaded 
by the King, and that there is no safety for anybody or 
anything. Then, when the five members are gone out of 
the way, down comes the King himself, with all his guard 
and from two to three hundred gentlemen and soldiers, of 
whom the greater part were armed. These he leaves in the 
hall; and then, with his nephew at his side, goes into the 
House, takes off his hat, and walks up to the Speaker’s 
chair. The Speaker leaves it, the King stands in, front of 
it, looks about him steadily for a little while, and says he 
has come for those five members. No one speaks, and then 
he calls John Pym by name. No one speaks, and then he 
calls Denzil Hollis by name. No one speaks, and then 
he asks the Speaker of the House where those five 
members are? The Speaker, answering on his knee, nobly 
replies that he is the servant of that House, and that he has 
neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak, anything but what 
the House commands him. Upon this, the King, beaten 
from that time ever more, replies that he will seek them him- 
self, for they have committed treason; and goes out, with 
his hat in his hand, amid some audible murmurs from the 
members. 

No words can describe the hurry that arose out of doors 
when all this was known. The five members had gone for 
safety to a house in Colemen-street, in the City, where 
they were guarded all night; and indeed the whole city 
watched in arms like an army. At ten o'clock in the 
morning, the King already frightened at what he had done, 
came to the Guildhall, with only half a dozen lords, and 
made a speech to the people, hoping they would not shelter 
those whom he accused of treason. Next day, he issued a 
proclamation for the apprehension of the five members; but 
the Parliament minded it so little that they made great 
arrangements for having them brought down to Westmin- 
ster in great state, five days afterwards. The King was so 
alarmed now at his own imprudence, if not for his own 
safety, that he left his palace at Whitehall, and went away 
with his Queen and children to Hampton Court. 

It was the eleventh of May, when the five members were 
carried in state and triumph to Westminster. They were

taken by water. The river could not be seen for the boats 
on it; and the live members were hemmed in by barges full 
of men and great guns, ready to protect them, at any cost. 
Along the Strand a large body of the train-bands of Lon- 
don, under their commander, Skippon, marched to be ready 
to assist the little fleet. Beyond them, came a crowd who 
choked the streets, roaring incessantly about the Bishops 
and the Papists, and crying out contemptuously as they 
passed Whitehall, “ What has become of the King? ” With 
this great noise outside the House of Commons, and with 
great silence within, Mr. Pym rose and informed the 
House of the great kindness with which they had been re- 
ceived in the City. Upon that, the House called the sher- 
iffs in and thanked them, and requested the train-bands, 
under their commander Skippon, to guard the House of 
Commons every day. Then, came four thousand men ou 
horseback out of Buckinghamshire, offering their services 
as a guard too, and bearing a petition to the King, com- 
plaining of the injury that had been done to Mr. Hamp- 
den, who was their county man and much beloved and 
honoured. 

When the King set off for Hampton Court, the gentle- 
men and soldiers who had been with him followed him out 
of town as far as Kingston-upon-Thames; next day. Lord 
Digby came to them from the King at Hampton Court, in 
his coach and six, to inform them that the King accepted 
their protection. This, the Parliament said, was making 
war against the kingdom, and Lord Digby fled abroad. The 
Parliament then immediately applied themselves to getting 
hold of the military power of the country, well knowing 
that the King was already trying hard to use it against 
them, and that he had secretly sent the Earl of Newcastle 
to Hull, to secure a valuable magazine of arms and gun- 
powder that was there. In those times, every county had 
its own magazines of arms and powder, for its own train - 
bands or militia; so, the Parliament brought in a bill claim- 
ing the right (which up to this time had belonged to the 
King) of appointing the Lord Lieutenants of counties, who 
commanded these train-bands; also, of having all the forts, 
castles, and garrisons in the kingdom, put into the hands 
of such governors as they, the Parliament, could confide in. 
It also passed a law depriving the Bishops of their votes. 
The King gave his assent to that bill, but would not

A CHILD’S HISTORY OP ENGLAND. 329 

abandon the right of appointing the Lord Lieutenants, 
though he said he was willing to appoint such as might be 
suggested to him by the Parliament. When the Earl of 
Pembroke asked him whether he would not give way on 
that question for a time, he said, “ By God ! not for one 
hour! ” and upon this he and the Parliament went to war. 

His young daughter was betrothed to the Prince of 
Orange. On pretence of taking her to the country of her 
future husband, the Queen was already got safely away to 
Holland, there to pawn the Crown jewels for money to 
raise an army on the King’s side. The Lord Admiral be- 
ing sick, the House of Commons now named the Earl of 
Warwick to hold his place for a year. The King named 
another gentleman; the House of Commons took its own 
way, and the Earl of Warwick became Lord Admiral with- 
out the King’s consent. The Parliament sent orders down 
to Hull to have that magazine removed to London; the 
King went down to Hull to take it himself. The citizens 
would not admit him into the town, and the governor 
would not admit him into the castle. The Parliament re- 
solved that whatever the two Houses passed, and the King 
would not consent to, should be called an Ordinance, and 
should be as much a law as if he did consent to it. The 
King protested against this, and gave notice that these or- 
dinances were not to be obeyed. The King/attended by 
the majority of the House of Peers, and by many members 
of the House of Commons, established himself at York. 
The Chancellor went to him with the Great Seal, and the 
Parliament made a new Great Seal. The Queen sent over 
a ship full of arms and ammunition, and the King issued 
letters to borrow money at high interest. The Parliament 
raised twenty regiments of foot and seventy-five troops 
of horse; and the people willingly aided them with their 
money, plate, jewellery, and trinkets — the married women 
even with their wedding-rings. Every member of Parlia- 
ment who could raise a troop or a regiment in his own part 
of the country, dressed it according to his taste and in his 
own colours, and commanded it. Foremost among them 
all, Oliver Cromwell raised a troop of horse — thoroughly 
in earnest and thoroughly well armed — who were, perhaps, 
the best soldiers that ever were seen. 

In some of their proceedings, this famous Parliament 
passed the bounds of previous law and custom, yielded to

and favoured riotous assemblages of the people, and acted 
tyrannically in imprisoning some who differed from the 
popular leaders. But again, you are always to remember 
that the twelve years during which the King had had his 
own wilful way, had gone before; and that nothing could 
make the times what they might, could, would, or should 
have been, if those twelve years had never rolled away. 

* 

THIRD PART. 

I shall not try to relate the particulars of the great civil 
war between King Charles the First and the Long Parlia- 
ment, which lasted nearly four years, and a full account of 
which would till many large books. It was a sad thing 
that Englishmen should once more be fighting against Eng- 
lishmen on English ground; but, it is Borne consolation to 
know that on both sides there was great humanity, forbear- 
ance, and honour. The soldiers of the Parliament were 
far more remarkable for these good qualities than the sol- 
diers of the King (many of whom fought for mere pay 
without much caring for the cause) ; but those of the nobil- 
ity and gentry who were on the King’s side were so brave, 
and so faithful to him, that their conduct cannot but com- 
mand our highest admiration. Among them were great 
numbers of Catholics, who took the royal side because the 
Queen was so strongly of their persuasion. 

The King might have distinguished some of these gallant 
spirits, if he had been as generous a spirit himself, by 
giving them the command of his army. Instead of that, 
however, true to his old high notions of royalty, he en- 
trusted it to his two nephews, Prince Rupert and Prince 
Maurice, who were of royal blood and came over from 
abroad to help him. It might have been better for him if 
they had stayed away; since Prince Rupert was an impet- 
uous hot-headed fellow, whose only idea was to dash into 
battle at all times and seasons, and lay about him. 

The general-in-chief of the Parliamentary army was the 
Earl of Essex, a gentleman of honour and an excellent sol- 
dier. A little while before the war broke out, there had 
been some rioting at Westminster between certain officious 
law students and noisy soldiers, and the shopkeepers and 
their apprentices, and the general people in the streets. 
At that time the King’s friends called the orowd, Round*

heads, because the apprentices wore short hair; the crowd, 
in return, called their opponents Cavaliers, meaning that 
they were a blustering set, who pretended to be very mili- 
tary These two words now began to be used to distin- 
guish the two sides in the civil war. The Royalists also 
called the Parliamentary men Rebels and Rogues, while 
the Parliamentary men called them Malignants, and spoke 
of themselves as the Godly, the Honest, and so forth. 

The war broke out at Portsmouth, where that double 
traitor Goring had again gone over to the King and was 
besieged by the Parliamentary troops. Upon this, the 
King proclaimed the Earl of Essex and the officers serving 
under him, traitors, and called upon his loyal subjects to 
meet him in arms at Nottingham on the twenty-fifth of 
August. But his loyal subjects came about him in scanty 
numbers, and it was a windy gloomy day, and the Royal 
Standard got blown down, and the whole affair was very 
melancholy. The chief engagements after this, took place 
in the vale of the Red Horse near Banbury, at Brentford, 
at Devizes, at Chalgrave Field (where Mr. Hampden was 
so sorely wounded while fighting at the head of his men, 
that he died within a week), at Newbury (in which battle 
Lord Falkland, one of the best noblemen on the King’s 
side, was killed), at Leicester, at Naseby, at Winchester, 
at Marston Moor near York, at Newcastle, and in many 
other parts of England and Scotland. These battles were 
attended with various successes. At one time, the King 
was victorious; at another time, the Parliament. But 
almost all the great and busy towns were against the King; 
and when it was considered necessary to fortify London, 
all ranks of people, from labouring men and women, up to 
lords and ladies, worked hard together with heartiness and 
good will. The most distinguished leaders on the Parlia- 
mentary side were Hampden, Sir Thomas Fairfax, and, 
above all, Oliver Cromwell, and his son-in-law Iketon. 

During the whole of this war, the people, to whom it was 
very expensive and irksome, and to whom it was made the 
more distressing by almost every family being divided — 
some of its members attaching themselves to one side and 
some to the other — were over and over again most anxious 
for peace. So were some of the best men in each cause. 
Accordingly, treaties of peace were discussed between com- 
missioners from the Parliament and the King; at York, at

Oxford (where the King held a little Parliament of his 
own), and at Uxbridge. But they came to nothing. In 
all these negotiations, and in all his difficulties, the King 
showed himself at his best. He was courageous, cool, self- 
possessed, and clever; but, the old taint of his character 
was always in him, and he was never for one siugle mo- 
ment to be trusted. Lord Clarendon, the historian, one of 
his highest admirers, supposes that he had unhappily prom- 
ised the Queen never to make peace without her consent, 
and that this must often be taken as his excuse. He never 
kept his word from night to morning. He signed a cessa- 
tion of hostilities with the blood-stained Irish rebels for 
a sum of money, and invited the Irish regiments over, to 
help him against the Parliament. In the battle of Naseby, 
his cabinet was seized and was found to. contain a corre- 
spondence with the Queen, in which he expressly told her 
that he had deceived the Parliament — a mongrel Parlia- 
ment, he called it now, as an improvement on his old term 
of vipers — in pretending to recognise it and to treat with 
it; and from which it further appeared that he had long 
been in secret treaty with the Duke of Lorraine for a for- 
eign army of ten thousand men. Disappointed in this, he 
sent a most devoted friend of his, the Earl of Glamor- 
gan, to Ireland, to conclude a secret treaty with the Cath- 
olic powers, to send him an Irish army of ten thousand men; 
in return for which he was to bestow great favours on the 
Catholic religion. And, when this treaty was discovered 
in the carriage of a fighting Irish Archbishop who was killed 
in one of the many skirmishes of those days, he basely de- 
nied and deserted his attached friend, the earl, on his being 
charged with high treason; and-— even worse than this — had 
left blanks in the secret instructions he gave him with his 
own kingly hand, expressly that he might thus save himself. 

At last, on the twenty-seventh day of April, one thou- 
sand six hundred and forty-six, the King found himself in 
the city of Oxford, so surrounded by the Parliamentary 
army who were closing in upon him on all sides that he felt 
that if he would escape he must delay no longer. So, that 
night, having altered the cut of his hair and beard, he was 
dressed up as a servant and put upon a horse with a cloak 
strapped behind him, and rode out of the town behind one 
of his own faithful followers, with a clergyman of that 
country who knew the road well, for a guide. He rode

towards London as far as Harrow, and then altered his 
plans and resolved, it would seem, to go to the Scottish 
camp. The Scottish men had been invited over to help the 
Parliamentary army, and had a large force then in Eng* 
land. The King was so desperately intriguing in every- 
thing he did, that it is doubtful what he exactly meant by 
this step. He took it, anyhow, and delivered himself up 
to the Earl of Leven, the Scottish general-in-chief, who 
treated him as an honourable prisoner. Negotiations be- 
tween the Parliament on the one hand and the Scottish 
authorities on the other, as to what should be done with 
him, lasted until the following February. Then, when the 
King had refused to the Parliament the concession of that 
old militia point for twenty years, and had refused to Scot- 
land the recognition of its Solemn League and Covenant, 
Scotland got a handsome sum for its army and its help, 
and the King into the bargain. He was taken, by certain 
Parliamentary commissioners appointed to receive him, to 
one of his own houses, called Holmby House, near Althorpe, 
in Northamptonshire. 

While the civil war was still in progress, John Pym died, 
and was buried with great honour in Westminster Abbey — 
not with greater honour than he deserved, for the liberties 
- of Englishmen owe a mighty debt to Pym and Hampden. 
The war was but newly over when the Earl of Essex died, 
of an illness brought on by his having overheated himself 
in a stag hunt in Windsor Forest. He, too, was buried in 
Westminster Abbey, with great state. I wish it were not 
necessary to add that Archbishop Laud died upon the 
scaffold when the war was not yet done. His trial lasted 
in all nearly a year, and, it being doubtful even then 
whether the charges brought against him amounted to trea- 
son, the odious old contrivance of the worst kings was re- 
sorted to, and a bill of attainder was brought in against 
him. He was a violently prejudiced and mischievous per- 
son ; had had strong ear-cropping and nose-splitting pro- 
pensities, as you know; and had done a world of harm. 
But he died peaceably, and like a brave old man. 

FOURTH PART. 

When the Parliament had got the King into their hands, 
they became very anxious to get rid of their army, in which' 
Oliver Cromwell had begun to acquire great power; not

only because of his courage and high abilities, but because 
he professed to be very sincere in the Scottish sort of Pu- 
ritan religion that was then exceedingly popular among the 
soldiers. They were as much opposed to the Bishops as 
to the Pope himself; and the very privates, drummers, and 
trumpeters had such an inconvenient habit of starting up 
and preaching long-winded discourses, that I would not 
have belonged to that army on any account. 

So, the Parliament, being far from sure but that the 
army might begin to preach and fight against them now it 
had nothing else to do, proposed to disband the greater 
part of it, to send another part to serve in Ireland against 
the rebels, and to keep only a small force in England. 
But, the army would not consent to be broken up, except 
upon its own conditions; and, when the Parliament 
showed an intention of compelling it, it acted for itself in 
an unexpected manner. A certain comet, of the name of 
Joice, arrived at Holmby House one night, attended by 
four hundred horsemen, went into the King’s room with 
his hat in one hand and a pistol in the other, and told the 
King that he had come to take him away. The King was 
willing enough to go, and only stipulated that he should 
be publicly required to do so next morning. Next morn- 
ing, accordingly, he appeared on the top of the steps of the 
house, and asked Cornet Joice before his men and the guard 
set there by the Parliament, what authority he had for 
taking him away? To this Cornet Joice replied, “The 
authority of the army.” “ Have you a written commis- 
sion? ” said the King, Joice, pointing to his four hundred 
men on horseback, replied, “That is my commission.” 
“ Well,” said the King, smiling, as if he were pleased, “I 
never before read such a commission; but it is written in 
fair and legible characters. This is a company of as hand- 
some proper gentlemen as I have seen a long while.” He 
was asked where he would like to live, and he said at New- 
market, So, to Newmarket he and Comet Joice and the 
four hundred horsemen rode; the King remarking, in the 
same smiling way, that he could ride as far at a spell as 
Comet Joice, or any man there. 

The King quite believed, I think, that the army were his 
friends. He said as much to Fairfax when that general, 
Oliver Cromwell, and Ireton, went to persuade him to re- 
turn to the custody of the Parliament He preferred to

when the army moved meaner: and nearer London to fright- 
en the Parliament ;into yielding ta their demands, they took, 
the King with, them*: It was a deplorable thing that Eng- 
land should be at the .mercy of a great body of soldiers' 
with arms in their hands; but the Ring certainly favoured 
them at this important time of his life, as compared with 
the more lawful power that tried to control him. It must 
lie added, however,* that they treated him, as yet, more re- 
spectfully and kindly than the Parliament had done. They, 
allowed him to be attended by his .own servants, to be, 
splendidly entertained at various houses, and to see his 
children — at Cavesham House, near Readingr— for two 
days. Whereas, the Parliament had been rather hard with 
him, and had only allowed him to ride oat and play at 
bowls.! ' ' •• • . ; 

It is much to be believed that , if the King could have 
been tvustdd, &ren atthis time, he might have been saved. 
Even Oliver Cromwell expressly said that he did believe that 
no man oould enjoy his poSsessionsin peace, unless, the King 
had hisj rights. Hie was not unfriendly toward the : King;

saw the King* often; he frequently walked and talked yrith 
him in the long galleries and pleasaint gardens of the Pal* 
ace at Hampton Court, whither he was now removed; and 
in all this risked something of his influence with the army. 
But, the King was in secret hopes of help from the Scottish, 
people; and the moment he was encouraged to join them 
he began to be coolto his new friends, the army, and to tell 
the officers r that Huey could not possibly do without him. 
At the very time, too, when hie was promising to make

the King’s most faithful followers that the King could not 
be trusted, and that he would not be answerable if any- 
thing amiss were to happen to him. Still, even after that, 
he kept a promise he had made to the King, by letting him 
know that there was a plot with a certain portion of the 
army to seize him. I believe that, in fact, he sincerely 
wanted the King to escape abroad, and so to be got rid of 
without more trouble or danger. That Oliver himself had 
work enough with the army is pretty plain; for some of 
the troops were so mutinous against him, and against those 
who acted with him at this time, that he found it neces- 
sary to have one man shot at the head of his regiment to 
Overawe the rest. 

The King, when he received Oliver’s warning, made his 
escape from Hampton Court; after some indecision and 
Uncertainty, he went to Carisbrooke Castle in the Isle of 
Wight. At hist, he was pretty free there; but, even 
there, he earned on a pretended treaty with the Parlia- 
ment, while he was really treating with commissioners from 
Scotland to send an army into England to take his part. 
When he broke off this treaty with*the Parliament (having 
settled with Scotland) and was treated as a prisoner, his 
treatment was not changed too soon, for he had plotted to 
escape that very night to a ship sent by the Queen, which 
was lying off the island. 

He was doomed to be disappointed in his hopes from 
Scotland. The agreement he had made with the Scottish 
Commissioners was not favourable enough to the religion 
of that country to please the Scottish clergy; and they 
preached against it. The consequence was, that the army 
raised in Scotland and sent over, was too small to do much ; 
and that, although it was helped by a rising of the Royal- 
ists in England and by good soldiers from Ireland, it could 
make no head against the Parliamentary army under such 
men as Cromwell and Fairfax. The King’s eldest son, the 
Prince of Wales, came over from Holland with nineteen 
ships (a part of the English fleet having gone over to him) 
to help his father; but nothing came of his voyage, and he 
was fain to return. The most remarkable event of this 
second civil war was the cruel execution by the Parliamen- 
tary General, of Sir Charles Lucas and Sir Gnoses 
Lisle, two grand Royalist generals, who had bravely de- 
fended Oolchester under every disadvantage of famine ami

distress for nearly three months. When Sir Charles Lncas 
was shot, Sir George Lisle kissed his body, and said to the 
soldiers who were to shoot him, “ Come nearer, and make 
sure of me. v “ I warrant you, Sir George,” said one of the 
soldiers, “we shall hit you.” “Ay?” he returned with a 
smile, “ but I have been nearer to you, my friends, many 
a time, and you have missed me.” 

The Parliament, after being fearfully bullied by the army 
— who demanded to have seven members whom they dis- 
liked given up to them — had voted that they would have 
nothing more to do with the King. On the conclusion, 
however, of this second civil war (which did not last more 
than six months), they appointed commissioners to treat 
with him. The King, then so far released again as to be 
allowed to live in a private house at Newport in the Isle of 
Wight, managed his own part of the negotiation with 1 a 
sense that was admired by all who saw him, and gave up, 
in the end, all that was asked of him — even yielding 
(which he had steadily refused, so far) to the temporary 
abolition of the bishops, and the transfer of their Church 
land to the Crown. Still, with his old fatal vice upon 
him, when his best friends joined the commissioners in 
beseeching him to yield all those points as the only means 
of saving himself from the army, he was plotting to escape 
from the island; he was holding correspondence with his 
friends and the Catholics in Ireland, though declaring that 
he was not; and he was writing, with his own hand, that in 
what he yielded he meant nothing but to get time to escape. 

Matters were at this pass when the army, resolved to 
defy the Parliament, marched up to London. The Parlia- 
ment, not afraid of them now, and boldly led by Hollis, 
voted that the King’s concessions were sufficient ground for 
settling the peace of the kingdom. Upon that, Colonel 
Rich and Colonel Pride went down to the House of Com- 
mons with a regiment of horse soldiers and a regiment of 
foot; and Colonel Pride, standing in the lobby with a list 
of the members who were obnoxious to the army in his 
hand, had them pointed out to him as they came through, 
and took them all into custody. This proceeding was after- 
wards called by the people, for a joke, Pride’s Purge. 
Cromwell was in the North, at the head of his men, at the 
time, but when he came home, approved Of what had been

Wihat with imprisoning some member® and oadsing oth- 
ers to stay away, the army had now reduced the. House of 
Common® to some fifty or so* These soon voted that it 
was treason in a king to make war . against his parliament 
and his people, and sent an Ordinance* up to the House of 
Lords for the King's- being tried as A traitioii : The House 
of Lords, then sixteen in number, to a man rejected it. 
Thereupon, the Commons made ah. ordinance o£ fch^ir own, * 
that they were the supreme/ government, of the country, 
and would bring the King to trial. i . 

The King had been taken for security to a place called 
Hurst Castle: & lonely howsloh. a rook m fthe sea, con- 
nected. with the coast of Hampshire by .a rough* road two 
miles long at low water. . Thence,, he ; Was (Ordered! to be 
removed to Windsor^ thenee, after bp ingi ibut Siudely used 
there, and having none but soldiers to Wait upon him At 
table, he was brought up to Saint Jameses* Palace in Lon- 
don, and told that his trial.was appointed fbr next day. 

On Saturday, the twentieth of January, ofce thousand 
six hundred and forty-nine, this, memorable trial began. 
The House * of Commons had, settled that one hundred and 
thirty-five persons should form the Court, and these were 
taken from tlie House itself, from among- the officers of the 
army, and from among the lawyers and citizens* John 
Bradshaw, serjeant-at-law, was appointed president. The 
place was Westminster Hall. : At the* upper ehdy in a red 
velvet chair, sat the president, with his hat (lined with 
plates of iron for his protection) on his head. The rest 
of the Court sat J( on side benches, also wearing their hats. 
The King's seat waa covered with .velvet, like that of 
the president, and was opposite to it. He was brought 
from Saint James's to Whitehall, and from Whitehall he 
came by water to hiB trial. 

When lie came[ in, he looked round very steadily on the 
Court, and on the great number Of* spectators, and then sat 
down; presently he - got up and looked round again. On 
the indictment “ against Charles Stuart, for high treason , ” 
being read, he smiled several < times, and he denied . the au- 
thority of th$ Court, saying that there oodld be no Parlia- 
ment withpuA a House of Lotrds, and that he saw no House 
of Lord® there. Also, that the King ought to be there, 
aud that he saw; no King in the King - a right place. Brad- 
shaw replied, that the Court was satisfied with its authority,

and that its authority Mrcri God’s authority and the king* 
dom’s. 'He then adjourned th6 Court to the following 
Monday;* On that day, the trial was resumed, and went 
on all the week. When the Saturday came, as the King 
passed forward : to his placed in the* Hall, some soldiers and 
others cried for • ft justice! ” and execution on him. That 
day, too, Bradshaw* dike an angry Sultan* wiore a red robe, 
instead bf the : black robe' h£ had worn before. The King 
was sentenced to 1 death that day. h£ front out, one 
solitary toldier said, “God bfess you* Sir! ” \ Fori this, his 
officer struck him. > The King said he thought the punish- 
ment exceeded the offence. The* silvel- head of his walking- 
stick had fallen oil while he leaned upon it, at one time of 
the trial. The 1 aisoident < seemed to disturb ham, as if he 
thought it ominous of the falling of his, owii 1 head ; and he 
admitted as much* nbw it was all over*. 

Being taken badk >tot Whitehall, he sent' to the House of 
Commons, saving! that hs the time of his execution might 
be nigh* he wished he might be allowed to see his darling 
children. It was granted. On the Monday he was taken 
back to Said t James’s; and his two children then in Eng- 
land, the Princess ELizabbtK thirteen years old, and the 
Duke op Gloucester nine years old, weiA brought to take 
leave of him, fium Sibn Houses, near Brentford. It was E 
sad and touching scene*; when he kissed and fondled those 
poor children,* and made a little present of two diamond 
seals 'to the Princess, and gave them tender messages to 
their mother (who little deserved them, for she had a lover 
of her own whom she' married Soon afterwards), and told 
them that he died “for the laws and liberties of the land.” 
I am bound to 8f\y that I don’t think he did, but I dare say 
he believed sol - i! 

There were ambassadors ffbm Holland that day, to inter* 
cede for the unhappy King, whom you and I both wish the 
Parliament had 1 Spared; but they got no answer. The 
Scottish commissioners interceded too ; so did the Prince 
of Wales, by a letter in which he bfferecL as the next heir 
to the throne, tb accept any conditions- from the Parlia- 
ment ; so did 'the Queen, by letter likewise, i Notwithstand* 
ing all, the warrant for the execution was this day signed. 
There is a story that as Olifrer Cromwell went to the table 
with the pen in his hand tb put his signature to it, he drew 
his pen across itlie f ace of one ; of i the commissioners, who

was standing near, and marked it with ink. That com- 
missioner had not signed his own name yet, and the story 
adds that when he came to do it he marked Cromwell's face 
with ink in the same way. 

The King slept well, untroubled by the knowledge that 
it was his last night on earth, and rose on the thirtieth of 
January, two hours before day, and dressed himself care- 
fully. He put on two shirts lest he should tremble with 
the cold, and had his hair very carefully combed. The 
warrant had been directed to three officers of the army, 
Colonel Hacker, Colonel Hunks and Colonel Phateb. 
At ten o’clock, the first of these came to the door and 
said it was time to go to Whitehall. The King, who had 
always been a quick walker, walked at his usual speed 
through the Park, and called out to the guard, with his 
accustomed voice of command, “ March on apace 1 ” When 
he came to Whitehall, he was taken to his own bedroom, 
where a breakfast was set forth. As he had taken the Sac- 
rament, he would eat nothing more ; but, at about the time 
when the church bells struck twelve at noon (for he had to 
wait, through the scaffold not being ready), he took the 
advice of the good Bishop Juxon who was with him, and 
ate a little bread and drank a glass of claret. Soon after 
he had taken this refreshment, Colonel Hacker oame to 
the chamber with the warrant in his hand, and called for 
Charles Stuart. 

And then, through the long gallery of Whitehall Palace, 
which he had often seen light and gay and merry and 
crowded, in very different times, the fallen King passed 
along, until he came to the centre window of the Banquet- 
ing House, through which he emerged upon the scaffold, 
which was hung with black. He looked at the two execu- 
tioners, who were dressed in black and masked; he looked 
at the troops of soldiers on horseback and on foot, and all 
looked up at him in silence; he looked at the vast array of 
spectators, filling up the view beyond, and turning all their 
faces upon him; he looked at his old Palace of Saint 
James’s; and he looked at the block. He seemed a little 
troubled to find that it was so low, and asked, “ if there 
were no place higher? ” Then, to those upon the scaffold, 
he said “ that it was the Parliament who had begun the 
war, and not he ; but he hoped they might be guiltless too, 
as ill instruments had gone between them. In one respect, 0

he said, “ he suffered justly ; and that was because he had 
permitted an unjust sentence to be executed on another.” 
In this he referred to the Earl of Strafford. 

He was not at all afraid to die ; but he was anxious to 
die easily. When some one touched the axe while he was 
speaking, he broke off and called out, “ Take heed of the 
axe ! take heed of the axe ! ” He also said to Colonel 
Hacker, “ Take care that they do not put me to pain.” He 
told the executioners, “ I shall say but very short prayed, 
and then thrust out my hands ” — as the sign to strike. 

He put his hair up, under a white satin cap which the 
bishop had carried, and said, “ I have a good cause and a 
gracious God on my side.” The bishop told hhn that he 
had but one stage more to travel in this weary world, and 
that, though it was a turbulent and troublesome stage, it 
was a short one, and would carry him a great way— all the 
way from earth to Heaven. The King’s last word, as he 
gave his cloak and the George— the decoration from his 
breast — to the bishop, was, “ Remember ! ” He then 
kneeled down, laid his head on the block, spread out his 
hands, and was instantly killed. One universal groan 
broke from the crowd ; and the soldiers, who had sat on 
their horses and stood in their ranks immovable as statues, 
were of a sudden all in motion, clearing the streets. 

Thus, in the forty-ninth year of his age, falling at the 
same time of his career as Strafford had fallen in his, per- 
ished Charles the First. With all my sorrow for him, I 
cannot agree with him that he died “ the martyr of the 
people ; ” for the pebple had been martyrs to him, and to 
his ideas of a King’s rights, long before. Indeed, I am 
afraid that he was but. a bad judge of martyrs ; for he had 
called that infamous Duke of Buckingham “ the Martyr of 
his Sovereign.” 


CHAPTER XXXIV. 

ENGLAND UNDER OLIVER CROMWELL.

Charles the .First was executed, the House of Commons 
passed an act declaring it treason in any one to proclaim 
the Frince of Wales— or anybody else— |Cing of England.

Soon Afterwards, it declared that the House of Lords was 
useless an d dangerous, and ought to be abolished ; and di- 
rected that the late Kiug*s statue should, be taken down 
from the Royal Exchange iu the City and j other , public 
places- Haying, laid hold of some, famous Royalists who 
had escaped from prison, and having beheaded the Duke 
op Hamilton, Loan Holland* and. Lord Caj»el, in Pal- 
ace Yard (all of whom died very courageously)!, they then 
appointed a Council of State to govern the country. It 
consisted of forty-one members, of whom live were peers. 
Bradshaw was made presidents The House of Commons 
also readmitted members* who had .opposed the King's 
death, and made up its numbers to about a hundred and 
fifty. ■ , • 

But, it still had an army of more than forty thousand 
men to deal with, and a very hard task it was to manage 
them. Before the King’s .execution* • the army had ap- 
pointed some of its officers to. remonstrate between them 
and the Parliament ; and now. the common soldiers began 
to take that office upon themselves. The regiments under 
orders for Ireland mutinied ; One ti'oop of horse; in the city 
of London seized their own flag, and refused to obey orders. 
For this, the ringleader was shot: which did not mend the 
matter, for, both his comrades and the people made a pub- 
lic funeral for him, arid accompanied the body to the grave 
with sound of trumpets and with a gloomy procession of 
persons carrying bundles of rosemary 1 steeped in blood. 
Oliver was the only man to deal with sitoh difficulties as 
these, and he soon cut them ^hort by bursting at midnight 
into the town of Buiford, near Salisbury, wliere the muti- 
neers were sheltered, taking, four hundred of them prison- 
ers, and shooting a number of them l by sentence of court- 
martial. The soldiers soon found, as all men did, that 
Oliver was not a man to be trifled with. And there was 
an end of the mutiny. 

The Scottish Parliament di^ not Jcnpy (^Jiv^r yet; so, on 
hearing of the King’s execution, it proclaimed the Prince 
of Wales King Charles, the* Secopd, .on* qqtyditjpp, qf his re- 
specting the Solemn League and Covenant. Charles was 
abroad at that time, and so was Montrose, from whose help 
he had hopes enough to keep him holding oU .and off with 
commissioners from Scotland, just as his father, might have 
done. These hopes were* soon at an end y for, Montrose,

having raised a few hundred exiles in Germany, and landed 
with them in Scotland, found that the people there, instead: 
of joining him, deserted the country at his approach. He 
was soon taken prisoner and Carried to Edinburgh. There 
he was received with every possible insult, and carried to* 
prison in a cart, his officers going two and two* before him. 
He was sentenced by the Parliament to be hanged on a gal- 
lows thirty feet high, to f have his head set on a spike in 1 
Edinburgh, and his limbs distributed in other places, ao-r 
cording to the old b&fbdrouS manner. - He said he had 
always acted under the Royal ordters^ and only wished he 
had limbs enough to be distributed through Christendom, 
that it might be the more widely known how loyal he had 
been. He went to the scaffold in a bright and brilliant 
dress, and made a bold end at thirty^eight years of age* 
The breath Was scarcely out of his* body when Charles 
abandoned his memory ^ and denied that he' had ever given 
him orders to rise in his behalf.- O the family failing was 1 
strong in that Charles then 1 *> r 

Oliver had been appointed by the Parliament to* com- 
mand the army in Ireland, where he took a terrible ven- 
geance for the sanguinary rebellion, and made tremendous 
havoc, particularly in the siege of Drogheda, where no 
quarter was given, and where he found at ieaBt a thousand 
of the inhabitants shut up together 'in the : great church : 
every one of whom was killed by his soldiers, usually known 
as Oliver’s Ironsides. There were numbers of f liars and 
priests among them, and Oliver gruffly ^rrote home in Ms 
despatch that these were u knocked* on the head ” like the 
rest. ' ' * 1 

But, Charles having got over to Scotland where the men 
of the Solemn League and Covenant’ led' him a prodigiously 
Hull life and made him very weary with lojsg sermons and 
grim Sundays, the Parliament called the redoubtable Oliver 
home to knock the Scottish men od the head for setting up 
that Prince. Oliver left his son-in-law, Helton, as general’ 
in Ireland in his stead (he'died there afterwards),. and he 
imitated the example of his fatherdn-law with Such’ good 
will that he brought the couhtry*to subjection, anddaid'it 
at the feet of the Parliament. 'In the -end, they passed 
an act for the settlement of. Ireland, generally! pardoning 
all the common people, but exempting from this grace such 
of the wealthier sort as had been concerned in the r rebellion*

or in any killing of Protestants, or who refused to lay down 
their arms. Great numbers of Irish were got out of the 
country to serve under Catholic powers abroad, and a quan- 
tity of land was declared to have been forfeited by past 
offences, and was given to people who had lent money to 
the Parliament early in the war. These were sweeping 
measures; but if Oliver Cromwell had had his own way 
fully, and had stayed in Ireland, he would have done more 
yet. 

However, as I have said, the Parliament wanted Oliver 
for Scotland ; so, home Oliver came, and was made Com- 
mander of all the Forces of the Commonwealth of England, 
and in three days away he went with sixteen thousand sol- 
diers to fight the Scottish men. Now, the Scottish men, 
being then — as you will generally find them now — mighty 
cautious, reflected that the troops they had were not used 
to war like the Ironsides, and would be beaten in an open 
fight. Therefore they said, “ If we lie quiet in our trenches 
in Edinburgh here, and if all the farmers come into the 
town and desert the country, the Ironsides will be driven 
out by iron hunger and be forced to go away.” This was, 
no doubt, the wisest plan ; but as the Scottish clergy would 
interfere with what they knew nothing about, and would 
perpetually preach long sermons exhorting the soldiers to 
come out and fight, the soldiers got it in their heads that 
they absolutely must come out and fight. Accordingly, in 
an evil hour for themselves, they came out of their safe 
position. Oliver fell upon them instantly, and killed three 
thousand, and took ten thousand prisoners. 

To gratify the Scottish Parliament, and preserve their 
favour, Charles had signed a declaration they laid before 
him, reproaching the memory of his father and mother, 
and representing himself as a most religious Prince, to 
whom the Solemn League and Covenant was as dear as life. 
He meant no sort of truth in this, and soon afterwards gal- 
loped away on horseback to join some tiresome Highland 
friends, who were always flourishing dirks and broad- 
swords. He was overtaken and induced to return ; but this 
attempt, which was called “The Stall;,” did him just so 
much service, that they did not preach quite such long ser- 
mons at him afterwards as they had done before. 

On the first of January, one thousand six hundred and 
fifty-one, the Scottish people crowned him at Scone. He

immediately took the chief command of an army of twenty 
thousand men, and marched to Stirling. His hopes were 
heightened, I dare say, by the redoubtable Oliver being ill 
of an ague ; but Oliver scrambled out of bed in no time, 
and went to work with such energy that he got behind the 
Royalist army and cut it off from all communication with 
Scotland. There was nothing for it then, but to go on 
to England ; so it went on as far as Worcester, where the 
mayor and some of the gentry proclaimed King Charles 
the Second straightway. His proclamation, however, was 
of little use to him, for very few Royalists appeared ; and, 
on the very same day, two people were publicly beheaded 
on Tower Hill for espousing his cause. Up came Oliver 
to Worcester too, at double quick speed, and he and his 
Ironsides so laid about them in the great battle which was 
fought there, that they completely beat the Scottish men, 
and destroyed the Royalist army ; though the Scottish men 
fought so gallantly that it took five hours to do. 

The escape of Charles after this battle of Worcester did 
him good service long afterwards, for it induced many of 
the generous English people to take a romantic interest in 
him, and to think much better of him than he ever deserved. 
He fled in the night, with not more than sixty followers, 
to the house of a Catholic lady in Staffordshire. There, 
for his greater safety, the whole sixty left him. He 
cropped his hair, stained his face and hands brown as if 
they were sunburnt, put on the clothes of a labouring coun- 
tryman, and went out in the morning with his axe in his 
hand, accompanied by four wood-cutters who were brothers, 
and another man who was their brother-in-law. These 
good fellows made a bed for him under a tree, as the 
weather was very bad ; and the wife of one of them brought 
him food to eat ; and the old mother of the four brothers 
came and fell down on her knees before him in the wood, 
and thanked God that her sons were engaged in saving his 
life. At night, he came out of the forest and went on to 
another house which was near the river Severn, with the 
intention of passing into Wales ; but the place swarmed 
with soldiers, and the bridges were guarded, and all the 
boats were made fast. So, after lying in a hayloft covered 
over with hay, for some time, he came out of his place, 
attended by Colonel Careless, a Catholic gentleman who 
had met him there, and with whom he l>ay hid, all

day, up' in the shady branches of a fine old oak. ' It was 
lucky foi* the King that it Was September-time, and that 
the leaves had hot begun to fall, Since he and the colonel, 
perched up in' this tree, Could Catch gliinpses of the soldiers 
riding hbdut below, and Could hear the crash in the wood 
ds they Went about beatiug the boUglis. 

After this, he walked and walked until his feet were all 
blistered; and, having been concealed all one day in a 
house Which wks searched' by the troopers while he was 
there ; 1 Went ‘with Lord WrnWoT, another of his good 
frietods, to a' place called ‘Bentley, where one Miss Lane, a 
Protestant lady, had obtained a 'pass to be allowed to ride 
throu'^h the 1 guards to see a relation of hers near Bristol. 
Disguised As a servant, he rode in the saddle before this 
young lady to the house of Sir John Winter, while Lord 
Wilmot rode there boldly, like a plain : country gentleman, 
with dogs at his heCls. It happened that Sir John Win- 
ter’s butler had' been servant in Richmond Palace, and 
knCW Charted the moment he set eyes upon him ; but, the 
biVtler was faithful and kept the secret. As no ship could 
be found to carry him abroad, it was planned that he should 
go — still travelling with Miss Lane as her servant — to 
another house, at Trent near Sherborne in Dorsetshire ; and 
then Miss Lane and her cousin, Mr. Lascelles, who had 
gone on horseback beside her all the Way, went home. I 
hope Miss Lane was going to marry that cousin, for I am 
sure she must have been a brave kind girl. If I had been 
that cousin,' I should certainly have loved Miss Lane. 

When' Charle’s, lonely for the loss 1 of Miss Lane, was safe 
at Trent,- a ; ship was ’ hired at Lyme, the master of which 
engaged to take two gentlemen to France. In the evening 
of the Same day, the King— now riding as servant before 
another young lady — set off for a public-house at a place 
called CharmoiVth, where the captain of the vessel was to 
take him on board. But, the captain's wife,' being afraid 
of her husband getting ' into trouble; locked him up and 
would not let him sail. Then they went away to Bridport ; 
and, coming to the inn there, found the stable-yard full of 
soldiers who were on the look-out for Charles, and who 
talked about him while they drank. He had such presence 
of mind, that he led the horses of his party through the 
yard as any other servant might have done, and said, 
“Come ‘out of the way, you soldiers; let us have room to

pass here ! ” As he werit Alohg, ; he met a half-tipty ostlery 
who rubbed his eyes and said to him, “ Why; I was^formetly 
servant to Mr. Potter at Exeter,, and surely I have some- 
times seen yon there, young irian? ” He ^certainly had, for 
Charles had lodged thdre. < His ready answer was, “ Ah, I 
did live with him . once 9 but 1 haVeno time to talk now. 
We’ll have a pot of beer together when I come back.” 

From this dangerous place he returned to Trent, and lay 
there concealed several days.;- Then he escaped to Heale, 
near Salisbury; where, in the house of a widow lady, he 
was hidden live days, until the master of a collier lying off 
Shoreham in Sussex, undertook to convey a “gentleman” 
to France. On the night of the fifteenth of October, ac- 
companied by two colonels and a merchant, the King rode 
to Brighton, then a little fishing village, to give the captain 
of the ship a supper before going . oh board ; but, so many 
people knew him, that this captain knew him too, and not 
only he, but the landlord and landlady also. Before he 
went away, the landlord oariie behind his chair, kissed his 
hand, and said he hoped to live to be a lord and to see his 
wife a lady; at which Charles laughed; . They had had a 
good supper by this time, arid plenty 6 f smoking. and drink- 
ing, at which the King was a first-rate hand ; so, the cap- 
tain assured him that he would stand by him, and he did. 
It was agreed that the captain should pretend to sail to 
Deal, and that Charles should address the sailors and say 
he was a gentleman in debt who was running away from 
his creditors, and that he' hoped they would join him in 
persuading the captain to '{put him ashore in France. As 
the King acted his part very well indeed, and gave! the 
sailors twenty shillings to drink, they begged the* captain 
to do what such a worthy gentleman asked. He pretended 
to yield to their entreaties, arid the .King got safe to 
Normandy. 

Ireland bdingnow subdued, and Scotland kfept quiet by 
plenty of forts and soldiers put there by Olivei*, the Parlia^ 
menfc would have gone on quietly enough, as far as fighting 
with any foreign enemy went, but for. getting into, trouble -

ships as the Dutch) to strike his flag, Blake fired a rag-

in g broadside instead, and beat off Van Tromp ; who, in the 
autumn, came back again with seventy ships, and chal- 
lenged the bold Blake — who still was only half as strong 
— to fight him. Blake fought him all day; but, finding 
that the Dutch were too many for him, got quietly off at 
night. What does Van Tromp upon this, but goes cruising 
and boasting about the Channel, between the North Fore- 
land and the Isle of Wight, with a great Dutch broom tied 
to his masthead, as a sign that he could and would sweep 
the English off the sea! Within three months, Blake low- 
ered his tone though, and his broom too; for, he and two 
other bold commanders, Dean and Monk, fought him three 
whole days, took twenty-three of his ships, shivered his 
broom to pieces, and settled his business. 

Things were no sooner quiet again, than the army began 
to complain to the Parliament that they were not govern- 
ing the nation properly, and to hint that they thought they 
could do it better themselves. Oliver, who had now made 
up his mind to be the head of the state, or nothing at all, 
supported them in this, and called a meeting of officers and 
his own Parliamentary friends, at his lodgings in White- 
hall, to consider the best way of getting rid of the Parlia- 
ment. It had now lasted just as many years as the King’s 
unbridled power had lasted, before it came into existence. 
The end of the deliberation was, that Oliver went down to 
the House in his usual plain black dress, with his usual 
grey worsted stockings, but with an unusual party of sol- 
diers behind him. These last he left in the lobby, and 
then went in and sat down. Presently he got up, made 
the Parliament a speech, told them that the Lord had done 
with them, stamped his foot and said, “ You are no Parlia- 
ment. Bring them in ! Bring them in ! ” At this signal 
the door flew open, and the soldiers appeared. “ This is 
not honest,” said Sir Harry Vane, one of the members. 
“ Sir Harry Vane ! ” cried Cromwell ; u O, Sir Harry Vane ! 
The Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane!” Then he 
pointed out members one by one, and said this man was a 
drunkard, and that man a dissipated fellow, and that man 
a liar, and so on. Then he caused the Speaker to be walked 
out of his chair, told the guard to clear the House, called 
the mace upon the table — which is a sign that the House 
is sitting — “a fool’s bauble,” and said, “here, carry it 
away!” Being obeyed in all these orders, he quietly

looked the door, pat the key in his pocket, walked back to 
Whitehall again, and told his friends, who were still assem- 
bled there, what he had done. 

They formed a new Council of State after this extraor- 
dinary proceeding, and got a new Parliament together in 
their own way : which Oliver himself opened in a sort of 
sermon, and which he said was the beginning of a perfect 
heaven upon earth. In this Parliament there sat a well- 
known leather-seller, who had taken the singular name of 
Praise God Barebones, mid from whom it was called, for a 
joke, Barebones’s Parliament, though its general name was 
the Little Parliaments As it soon appeared that it was 
not going to put Oliver in the first place, it turned out to 
be not at all like the beginning of heaven upon earth, and 
Oliver said it really was not to be borne with. So he 
cleared off that Parliament in much the same way as he 
had disposed of the other ; and then the council of officers 
decided that he must be made the supreme authority of the 
kingdom, under the title of the Lord Protector of the Com- 
monwealth. 

So, on the sixteenth of December; one thousand six hun- 
dred and fifty-three, a great procession was formed at Oli- 
ver’s door, and he came out in a black velvet suit and a 
big pair of boots, and got into his coach and went down to 
Westminster, attended by the judges, and the lord mayor, 
and the aldermen, and all the other great and wonderful 
personages of the country. There, in the Court of Chancery, 
he publicly accepted the office of Lord Protector. Then he 
was sworn, and the City sword was handed to him, and the 
seal was handed to him, aiid all the other things were handed 
to him which are usually handed to Kings and Queens on 
state occasions. When Oliver had handed them all back, 
he was quite made and completely finished off as Lord Pro- 
tector; and several of the Ironsides preached about it at 
great length, all the evening.

Oliver Cromwell — whom the people long ealled Old 
Noll— in accepting the office of Protector, had bound him- 
self by a certain paper which was handed to him, called “ the 
Instrument,” to summon a Parliament, consisting of between 
four and five hundred members, in the election of which

neither the Royalists not the C&tholios were to have any 
share. He had also pledged himself that this Parliament 
should not be dissolved without its own consent until it 
had. sat five months* •' * . 

. , When this Parliament met^ Oliver made a speech to them 
of three hours loug, very wisely advising them what to do 
for the credit and happiness of the country. To keep down 
the more violent members, he required them to sign a recog- 
nition of what they were forbidden by " the Instrument ” 
to do; which was, chiefly, to. take the power from one sin- 
gle person at the head of the state or to bommand the army. 
Then he dismissed them to go to work. With his usual 
vigour and resolution he Went to work himself with some 
frantic preachers — who .were rafchei* overdoing their ser- 
mons in calling him a villain and a tymnt^-by shutting up 
their ehapels^ and sending a few of theiti off to prison. 

There was not at that time, in England or anywhere else, . 
a man so able to. govern the country as Oliver Cromwell. 
Although he ruled with a' strong hand, and levied a very 
heavy tax on the Royalists (but not until they had plotted 
against his life), he ruled wisely j and as the times required. 
He caused England to be so respected, abroad, that I wish 
some lords and gentlemen who have governed it under 
kings and queens in later days would have taken a leaf out 
of Oliver Cromwell’s book. He sent bold. Admiral Blake 
to the Mediterranean Sea, to make the Duke of Tuscany 
pay sixty thousand pounds for injuries he had clone to Brit- 
ish sulqeots, and spoliation he had committed on English 
merchants. He further despatched, him and his fleet to 
Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, to have eveiy English ship 
and every English man delivered up to him that had been 
taken by pirates in those parts. All this was gloriously 
done ; and it began to be thoroughly well known, all over 
the world, that England. was governed by a man in earnest, 
who would not allow the English name to be insulted or 
slighted anywhere. 

These were not all hi^ foreign triumphs. He sent a fleet 
to sea against the Dutch ; and the two powers, each with 
one hundred ships upon its 6ide, met in the English Chan- 
nel off 'the North Foreland; where the fight lasted all day 
long. Dean was killed in this fight; but Monk, who com- 
manded in the same ship with him, threw his cloak over 
his body, that the sailors might not know of his death, and

be disheartened. Nor were they.. The English broadsides 
so exceedingly astonished the Dutch that they sheered off 
at last, though the redoubtable Van Tromp tired upon them 
with his own guns for deserting their flag. Soon after- 
wards, the two fleets engaged again, off the coast of Holt- 
land. There, the valiant Van Tromp was shot through 
the heart, and the Dutch gave in, and peace was made. 

Further than this, Oliver resolved not to. bear the domi^ 
neering and bigoted conduct of Spain, which country not 
only claimed a right to all the gold and silver that could 
be found in South America, and treated the ships of all 
other countries who visited those regions* as pirates, but 
put English subjects into the horrible Spanish . prisons of 
the Inquisition. So, Oliver told the Spanish ambassador 
that English ships must be, free to go wherever they would, 
and that English merchants must ndt be thrown into those 
same dungeons, no, not for the pleasure of all the priests 
in Spain. To this, the Spanish ambassador replied that 
the gold and silver country* and the Holy Inquisition, were 
his King’s two eyes, neither of which he could submit to 
have put out. Very well* said Oliver, then, he was afraid 
he (Oliver) must damage those two eyes direofcly. 

So, another' fleet wks despatched under two commanders*, 
Penn and Vexabi.es, for Hispaniola; where, however, the 
Spaniards got the better of the fight. Consequently, the 
fleet came ' home 1 again, after taking Jamaica on the way. 
Oliver, indignant with the two commanders who had; not 
done what -bold Admiral Blake would have done, clapped 
them, both • into prison, declared war against . Spain* and 
made a treaty with Fraude, in virtue of which it was; to 
shelter the Kiilg and liis brother the Duke; of York no 
longer. Then, he- sent a fleet abroad under bold Admiral 
Blake, which brought the King of Portugal to his senses 
just to keep 1 its hand inland then engaged a Spanish fleet, 
sunk four great ships, and took two more, laden with silver 
to the value of two millions of pounds; which dazzling 
prize was brought from Portsmouth to. Loudon in waggons, 
with the populace of all the towns and villages through 
which the Waggons passed, shouting with all their 'might. 
After this victory, bold Admiral Blake availed; away to the 
port of Santa Cruz to cut off the Spanish treasurer-ships 
coming from Mexico. There, he found, them, ten in. num- 
ber, with seven otherd to take care of them, and a big castle,

arid seven batteries, all roaring and blazing away at him 
with great guns. Blake cared no more for great guns than 
for pop-guns — no more for their hot iron balls than for 
snow-balls. He dashed into the harbour, captured and 
burnt every one of the ships, and came sailing out again 
triumphantly, with the victorious English flag flying at his 
masthead. This was the last triumph of this great com- 
mander, who had sailed and fought until he was quite worn 
out. He died, as his successful ship was coming into Ply- 
mouth Harbour amidst the joyful acclamations of the peo- 
ple, and was buried in state in Westminster Abbey. Not 
to- lie there, long. 

Over and above all this, Oliver found that the Vaudois, 
or Protestant people of the valleys of Lucerne, were inso- 
lently treated by the Catholic powers, and were even put 
to death for their religion, in an audacious and bloody 
manner. Instantly, he informed those powers that this 
Was a thing which Protestant England would not allow ; 
and he speedily carried his point, through the might of his 
great name, and established their right to worship God in 
peace after their own harmless manner. 

Lastly, his English army won such admiration in fight- 
ing with the French against the Spaniards, that, after 
they had assaulted the town of Dunkirk together, the 
French King in person gave it up to the English, that it 
might be a token to them of their might and valour. 

There were plots enough against Oliver among the fran- 
tic religionists (who called themselves Fifth Monarchy 
Men), and among the disappointed Republicans. He had 
a difficult game to play, for the Royalists were always ready 
to side with either party against him. The " King over 
the water,” too, as Charles was called, had no scruples 
about plotting with any one against his life ; although there 
is reason to Buppose that he would willingly have married 
one of his daughters, if Oliver would have had such a son- 
indaw. There was a certain Colonel Saxby of the army, 
once a great supporter of Oliver’s but now turned agaiust 
him, who was a grievous trouble to him through all this 
part of his career ; and who came and went between the 
discontented in England and Spain, and Charles who pnt 
himself in alliance with Spain on being thrown off by 
France. This man died in prison at last ; but not until 
there had been very serious plots between the Royalists

and Republicans, and an actual rising of them in England,' 
when they burst into the city of Salisbury on a Sunday 
night, seized the judges who were going to hold the assizes* 
there next day, and would have hanged them but for the* 
merciful objections of the more temperate of their number. 
Oliver was so vigorous and shrewd that he soon ptit this 
revolt down, as he did most other conspiracies; and it 
was well for one of its chief managers — that same Lord 
Wibnot who had assisted in Charles’s flight, and was no W 
Earl op Rochester — that he made his escape. Oliver 
seemed to have eyes and ears everywhere, and secured such 
sources of information as his enemies little dreamed of. 
There was a chosen body of six persons, called the Sealed 
Knot, who were in the closest and most secret confidence 
of Charles. One of the foremost of these very men, a Snt 
Richard Willis, reported to Oliver everything that passed 
among them, and had two hundred a year for it. 

Miles Syndarcomb, also of the old army, was another 
conspirator against the Protector. He and a man named* 
Cecil, bribed one of his Life Guards to let them have good 
notice when he was going out — intending to shoot him from 
a window. But, owing either to his caution or his good 
fortune, they could never get an aim at him. Disappointed 
in this design, they got into the chapel in Whitehall, with 
a basketful of combustibles, which were to explode by means 
of a slow match in six hours ; then, in the noise and confu- 
sion of the fire, they hoped to kill Oliver. But, the Life 
Guardsman himself disclosed this plot; and they were 
seized, and Miles died (or killed himself in prison) a little 
while before he was ordered for execution. A few such 
plotters Oliver caused to be beheaded, a few more to be 
hanged, and many more, including those who rose in iarms 
against him, to be sent as slaves to the West Indiesi If 
he were rigid, he was impartial too, in asserting the laws 
of England. When a Portuguese nobleman, the brother 
of the Portuguese ambassador, killed a London citizen in 
mistake for another man with whom he had had a quarrel, 
Oliver caused him to be tried before a jury of Englishmen 
and foreigners, and had him executed in spite of the en- 
treaties of all the ambassadors in London. 

One of Oliver’s own friends, the Duke op Oldenbttrgh, 
in sending him a present of six fine coach-horses, was very 
near doing more to please the Royalists them fell the plot 4

tars put together One day, Oliver went with his coach, 
drawn by these six horses, into Hyde Park, to dine with 
his : secretary and some of his other gentlemen under the 
trees there. After dinner, being merry, he took it into his 
head to put his friends inside and to drive them home: a 
postilion riding one Of the foremost horses, as the custom 
was. On account of Oliver’s being too free with the whip, 
the six fine horses went off at a galop, the postilion got 
thrown, and Oliver fell Upon the coach-pole and narrowly 
escaped being shot by his own pistol, which got entangled 
With his clothes in the harness, and went off. He was 
dragged some distance by the foot, until his foot came out 
of the shoe, and then he came safely to the ground under 
the broad body of the coach, and was very little the worse. 
The gentlemen inside were only bruised, and the discon- 
tented people of all parties were much disappointed. 

The rest of the history of the Protectorate of Oliver 
Cromwell is a history of his Parliaments. His first one 
not pleasing him at all, he waited until the five months 
were out, and then dissolved it. The next was better 
suited to his views; and from that he desired to get — if he 
could with safety to himself — the title of King. He had 
had this in his mind some time : whether because he thought 
that the English people, being more used to the title, were 
more likely to obey it; or whether because he really wished 
to be a king himself, and to leave the succession to that 
title in his family, is far from clear. He was already as 
high, in England and in all the world, as he would ever 
be> and I doubt if he eared: for the mere name. However, 
a paper, called the “ Humble Petition and Advice, 99 was 
presented to him by the House of Commons, praying him 
to take a high title and to appoint his successor. That he 
Would have taken the title of Kiug there is no doubt, but 
for the strong opposition rtf the army. This induced him 
to forbear, and to assent only to the other points of the 
petition. Upon which occasion there was another grand 
show in Westminster Hall, when the Speaker of the House 
of Crtmmons formally invested him with a purple robe 
lined with ermine, and presented him with a splendidly 
bound Bible, aiul pitt a golden sceptre in his hand. The 
next time the- Parliament met, he called a House of Lords 
of sixty members, as the petition gave him power to do; 
but as that Parliament did. not please him either, aud would

not proceed to the business of the country, lie jumped into* 
a coach one morning, took six Guards with him, and sent 
them to the rightabout. I wish this had been a warning 1 
to Parliaments to avoid long speeches, and do more work. 

It was the month of August, one thousand six hundred 
and fifty-eight, when Oliver Cromwell's favourite daughter, 
Elizabeth Claypolb (who had lktely lost her youngest 
son), lay very ill, and his mind was greatly troubled, be-- 
cause he loved her dearly. Another of his daughters was 
married to Lord Falconberg, another to the grandson of 
the Earl of Warwick, and he had made his son Richard one 1 
of the Members of the Upper House. He was very kind 
and loving to them' all, being a good father and a- good 
husband, but he loved this daughter the best of the family,* 
and went down to Hampton Court to see her, atnd could 
hardly be induced to stir from her sick room until she died; 
Although his religion had been of a gloomy kind, his dis- 
position had been always cheerful. He had been fond of 
music in his home, and had kept open table once a week 
for all officers of the army not below the rank of captain, 
and had always preserved in his house a quiet sensible dig+ 
nity. He encouraged men of genius and learning, and* 
loved to have them about him. Miltok Was one of his 
great friends. He was good humoured too, with the no- 
bility, whose dresses and manners were Very different from 
his ; and to show them what good information he had, he 
would sometimes jokingly tell them when they were his 
guests, where *they had last drunk the health of the “ King 
over the water,” and would recommend them to be morel 
private (if they could) another time. But he had lived in 
busy times, had borne the weight of heavy State affairs, 
and had often gone in feat of his life. He was ill of the 
gout and ague; and when the death of his beloved child 
came upon him in addition, he sank, never to raise his 
head again. He told his physicians on the twenty-fourth: 
of August that the Lord had asfeured him ‘that he wks not 
to die in that illness, and that he wbuM ceitainly get bet- 
ter. ThiB was only his sick fancy, for 'on the third of Sep- 
tember, which was the anniversary of the great battle of 
Worcester, and the day of the yea t Which he called his 
fortunate day, he died, in the sixtieth year of his age. Ho 
had been delirious, and had lain insensible some hours, but 
he had been overheard to murmur a very good prayer the

day before. The whole country lamented his death. If 
you want to know the real worth of Oliver Cromwell, and 
his real services to his country, you can hardly do better 
than compare England under him, with England umjer 
Charles the Second. 

He had appointed his son Richard to succeed him, and 
after there had been, at Somerset House in the Strand, a 
lying in state more splendid than sensible — as all such 
vanities after death are, I think — Richard became Lord 
Protector. He was an amiable country gentleman, but had 
none of his father’s great genius, and was quite unfit for 
such a post in such a storm of parties. Richard’s Protec- 
torate, which only lasted a year and a half, is a history of 
quarrels between the officers of the army and the Parlia- 
ment, and between the officers among themselves ; and of 
a growing discontent among the people, who had far too 
many long sermons and far too few amusements, and wanted 
a change. At last, General Monk got the army well into 
his own hands, and then in pursuance of a secret plan he 
seems to have entertained from the time of Oliver’s death, 
declared for the King’s cause. He did not do this openly ; 
but, in his place in the House of Commons, as one of the 
members for Devonshire, strongly advocated the proposals 
of one Sir J qhn Greenville, who came to the House with 
a letter from Charles, dated from Breda, and with whom 
he had previously been in secret communication. There 
had been plots and counterplots, and a recall of the last 
members of the Long Parliament, and an end of the Long 
Parliament, and risings of the Royalists that were made 
too soon ; and most men being tired out, and there being 
no one to head the country now great Oliver was dead, it 
was readily agreed to welcome Charles Stuart. Some of 
the wiser and better members said — what was most true — 
that in the letter from Breda, he gave no real promise to 
govern well, and that it would be best to make him pledge 
himself beforehand as to what he should be bound to do for 
the benefit of the kingdom. Monk said, however, it would 
be all right when he came, and he could not come too 
soon. 

So, everybody found out all in a moment that the coun- 
try must be prosperous and happy, having another Stuart 
to condescend to reign over it; and there was a prodigious 
firing off of guns, lighting of bonfire*, ringing of bells, aud

throwing up of caps. The people drank the King’s health 
by thousands in the opeu streets, and everybody rejoiced. 
Down came the Arms of the Commonwealth, up went 
the Hoyal Arms instead, and out came the public money. 
Fifty thousand pounds for the King, ten thousand pounds 
for his brother the Duke of York, live thousand pounds for 
his brother the Duke of Gloucester. Prayers for these 
gracious Stuarts were put up in all the churches ; commis- 
sioners were sent to Holland (which suddenly found out 
that Charles was a great man, and that it loved him) to in- 
vite the King home ; Monk and the Kentish grandees weut 
to Dover, to kneel down before him as he landed. He 
kissed and embraced Monk, made him ride in the coach 
with himself and his brothers, came on to London amid 
wonderful shoutings, and passed through the. army at Black- 
heath on the twenty-ninth of May (his birthday), in the 
year one thousand six hundred and sixty. Greeted by 
splendid dinners under tents, by flags and tapestry stream- 
ing from all the houses, by delighted crowds in all the 
streets, by troops of noblemen and gentlemen in rich 
dresses, by City companies, train-bands, drummers, trum- 
peters, the great Lord Mayor, and the majestic Aldermen, 
the King went on to Whitehall. On entering it, he com- 
memorated his Restoration with the joke that it. really 
would seem to have been his own fault that he had not 
come long ago, since everybody told him that he had always 
wished for him with all his heart. 


CHAPTER XXXV. 

ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE SECOND, CALLED 
THE MERRY MONARCH. 

There never were such profligate times in England as 
under Charles the Second. Whenever you see his portrait, 
with his swarthy ill-looking face and great nose, you may 
fancy him in his Court at Whitehall, surrounded by some 
of the very worst vagabonds in the kingdom (though they 
were lords and ladies), drinking, gambling, indulging in 
vicious conversation, and committing every kind, of profli*

galle excess. It has been a fashion to call Charles the Sec- 
ond “ The Merry Monarch.” Let me try to give you a 
general idea of some of the merry things that were done, 
in the merry days when this merry gentleman sat upon his 
merry throne, in merry England. 

The first merry proceeding was — of course — to declare 
that he was one of the greatest, the wisest, and the noblest 
kings that ever shone, like the blessed sun itself, on this 
benighted, earth. The next merry and pleasant piece of 
business was, for the Parliament, in the humblest manner, 
to give him one million' two hundred thousand pounds a 
year, and to settle upon him for life that old disputed ton- 
nage and poundage which had been so bravely fonght for. 
Then, General Monk, being made Earl of Albemarle, 
and a few other Royalists similarly rewarded, tlio law went 
to work to see what was to be done to those persons (they 
were called Regicides) who had been concerned in making 
a martyr of the late King. Ten of these were merrily exe- 
cuted; that is to say, six of the judges, one of the council, 
Colonel Hacker and another officer who had commanded the 
Guards, and Hugh Peters, a preacher who had preached 
against the martyr with all his heart* These executions 
were so extremely merry, that every horrible circumstance 
which Cromwell had abandoned was revived with appalling 
cruelty. The hearts of the sufferers were tom out of their 
living bodies ; their bowels were burned before their faces ; 
the executioner cut jokes to the next- victim* as he rubbed 
his filthy hands together, that were reeking with the blood 
of the last ; and the heads of the dead were drawn on 
sledges with the living to the place of suffering. Still, 
even so merry a monarch could not force one of these dying 
men to say that he was sorry for what he had done. Nay, 
the most memorable thing said among them was, that if 
the thing were to do again they Would do it. 

Sir Harry Vane, who had furnished the evidence against 
Strafford, and was one of the most stannch of the Republi- 
cans, was also tried, found guilty, and ordered for execu- 
tion. When he came upon the scaffold on Tower Hill, 
after conducting his own defence with great power, his 
botes of what he had meant to say to the people were torn 
away from him, and the drums and trumpets were ordered 
to sound lustily and drown his voice ; tor, the people had 
been so much impressed by what the Regicides had calmly

A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND 


said with their last breath, that it was the custom how, to 
have the drums and trumpets always under the scaffold, 
ready to strike up. Vane said no more than this : “ It is h 
bod cause which cannot bear the wofads of a dying min l n 
and bravely died. ' 

These merry scenes were succeeded by another, perhaps 
even -merrier. On the anniversary of the late Ring’s death; 
the bodies of Oliver Oram welly Ireton, and Bradshaw were 
torn out of their graves in Westminster Abbey * dragged to 
Tyburn, hanged there on a gallows all day long, and then 
beheaded.* Imagine the head of Oliver Cromwell set upon a 
pole to be stared at by a brutal crowd* not onie of whom 
would have dared to look the living Oliver in the face for 
half a moment! Think, after you have read this feign* 
what England was under Oliver Cromwell who was torn 
out of his grave, and what it was Under this merry monarch 
who sold it, like a merry Judas, over and over again. 

Of course, the remains of Oliver’s Wife -and daughter 
were not to be spared either, though they had been most 
excellent women. The base clergy Of that time gave up 
their bodies, whioh had befcn buried in the Abbey, and— id 
the eternal disgrace of England— they were thrown ItiiSo a 
pit, together with the mouldering bones of Pym and of the 
brave and bold old Admiral Blake. 

The clergy acted this disgraceful paft because they hoped 
to get the nonconformists, or dissenters* thoroughly put 
down in this reign, and to have but one prayer-book and 
one service for all kinds of people, tio matter what their 
private opinions were. This was 1 pretty well* 1 ihihk, for 
a Protestant Church, which had displaced the Romish 
Ohuroh because people had a right to their own opinions in 
religious matters. However* they* carried it* with a high 
band, and a prayer-book was agreed upon, : } in which the 
extremest opinions of Archbishop Laud wexd not forgotten. 
An Act was passed, too, preventing any dissenter froni 
bolding any office tinder any corporation; * So, the regulaf 
clergy in their triumph were soon as merry as the King. 
The army being by this time disbanded; and the King 
crowned, everything was to go on easily for evermore. 

I must say a word here about' the King’s family. Hb 
had not been' long upon the throne when ' his ‘brother the 
Duke of Oloucester, aftd his sister the Friitcess of Ori 4 
ange, died within a few months- of each other, of smalL

pox. His remaining sister, the Princess Henrietta, mar- 
ried the Duke of Orleans, the brother of Louis the 
Fourteenth, King of France. His brother James, Duke 
of York, was made High Admiral, and by-and-bye became 
a Catholic. He was a gloomy sullen bilious sort of man, 
with a remarkable partiality for the ugliest women in the 
country. He married, under very discreditable circum- 
stances, Anne Hydb> the daughter of Lord Clarendon, 
then the King’s principal minister — not at all a delicate 
minister either, but doing much of the dirty work of a very 
dirty palace. It became important now that the King him - 
self should be married ; and divers foreign Monarchs, not 
very particular about the character of their son-in-law, pro- 
posed their daughters to him. The King of Portugal 
offered his daughter, Catherine of Braganza, and fifty 
thousand pounds : in addition to which, the French King, 
who was favourable to that match, offered a loan of another 
fifty thousand. The King of Spain, on the other hand, 
offered any one out of a dozen of Princesses, and other 
hopes of gain. But the ready money carried the day, and 
Catherine came over in state to her merry marriage. 

The whole Court was a great flaunting crowd of de- 
bauched men and shameless women ; and Catherine’s merry 
husband insulted and outraged her in every possible way, 
until she consented to receive those worthless creatines as 
her very good friends, and to degrade herself by their com- 
panionship. A Mrs. Palmer, whom the King made Lady 
Castlemaine, and afterwards Duchess of Cleveland, was 
one of the most powerful of the bad women about the 
Court, and had great influence with the King nearly all 
through his reign. Another merry lady named Moll Da- 
vies, a dancer at the theatre, was afterwards her rival. 
So was Nell Gwyn, first an orange girl and then an actress, 
who really had good in her, and of whom one of the worst 
things I know is, that actually she does seem to have been 
fond of the King. The first Duke of St. Albans was 
this orange girl’s child. In like manner the son of a merry 
waiting-lady, whom the King created Duchess of Ports- 
mouth, became the Duke of Richmond. Upon the whole 
it is not so bad a thing to be a commoner. 

The Merry Monarch was so exceedingly merry among 
these merry ladies, and some equally merry (and equally 
infamous) lords and gentlemen, that he soon got through

his hundred thousand pounds, and then, by way of raising 
a little pocket-money, made a merry bargain * He sold 
Dunkirk to the French King for five millions of livres. 
When I think of the dignity to which Oliver Cromwell 
raised England in the eyes of foreign powers, and when I 
think of the manner in which he gained for England this 
very Dunkirk, 1 am much inclined to consider that if the 
Merry Monarch had been made to follow his father for this 
action, he would have received his just deserts. 

Though he was like his father in none of that father’s 
greater qualities, he was like him in being worthy of no 
trust. When he sent that letter to the Parliament, from 
Breda, he did expressly promise that all sincere religious 
opinions should be respected. Yet he was no sooner firm 
in his power than he consented to one of the worst Acts of 
Parliament ever passed. Under this law, every minister 
who should not give his solemn asseilt to the Prayer-Book 
by a certain day, was declared to be a minister no longer, 
and to be deprived of his church. The consequence of this 
was that some two thousand honest men were taken from 
their congregations, and reduced to dire poverty and dis- 
tress. It was followed by another outrageous law, called 
the Conventicle Act, by which any person above the age of 
sixteen who was present at any religious service not accord- 
ing to the Prayer-Book, was to be imprisoned three months 
for the first offence, six for the second, and to be trans- 
ported for the third. This Act alone tilled the prisons, 
which were then most dreadful dungeons, to overflow- 
ing. 

The Covenanters in Scotland had already fared no bet- 
ter. A base Parliament, usually known as the Drunken 
Parliament, in consequenoe of its principal members being 
seldom sober, had been got together to make laws against 
the Covenanters, and to force all men to be of one mind in 
religious matters. The Marquis of Argyx-e, relying on 
the King’s honour, had given himself up to him; but, he 
was wealthy, and his enemies wanted his wealth. He was 
tried for treason, on the evidence of some private letters in 
which he had expressed opinions — as well he might — more 
favourable to the government of the late Lord Protector 
than of the present merry and religious King. He was 
executed, as were two men of mark among the Covenanters ; 
and Sharp, a traitor who had once been the friend of the

Presbyterians and betrayed them, was made Archbishop of 
Skint Andrew's, to teach the Scotch how to like bishops. 

Things being in this merry state at home, the Merry 
Monarch undertook a war with the Dutch ; principally be- 
cause thfey interfered with an African company, established 
with the two objects, of buying gold-dust and slaves, of 
which the Duke of York was a leading member.. After 
some preliminary hostilities, the said duke sailed to the 
coast of Holland with a fleet of ninety-eight vessels of war, 
and four fire-ships. This engaged with the Dutch fleet, 
of no fewer than one hundred and thirteen ships. In the 
great battle between the two forces, the Dutch lost eighteen 
ships, four admirals, and seven thousand men. But, the 
English on shore were in no mood of exultation when they 
heard the news. 

For, this was the! year and the time of the Great Plague 
in Lbndon. Dhring:the winter of one thousand Bix hun- 
dred and sixty-four it had been whispered about, that some 
few people hqd died here and therd of the disease called 
the Plague* in some of the unwholesome suburbs around 
London: .News was not published at that time as it is 
now, and some people believed these rumours, aiid some 
disbelieved them, and they were soon forgotten. But, in 
the month of May, one thousand six hundred and sixty- 
five, it began to be said all -over the totfn that the disease 
had burst out with great violence in Saint Giles’s, and that 
the people were dying in great numbers. This soon turned 
out to be awfully true>. The roads out. of London were 
choked up by people endeavouring to escape from the in- 
fected city* and large sums were paid for any kind of con- 
veyance. The disease soon spread so fast, that it was 
necessary to shut up the houses in which sick people were, 
and to i cat them off from communication with the living. 
Everyone of these houses was marked on the outside of 
the door with a Ted cross, and the words, Lord, have mercy 
upou ut!. The streets were all deserted, grass grew in the 
public, way sj. and there was a dreadful silence in the air. 
Wlien ni&ht came on* dismal rumblings used to be heard,

performed over them; all men being afraid to Btayfbr a 
moment on the brink of the ghastly graves; In the gen- 
eral fear, children ran away from their parents, ind parents 
from their children. Some who were taken ill; died alone, 
without any help. Some were stabbed or strangled by 
hired nurses who robbed them of all their money, and stole 
the very beds on which they lay. Some went mad, dropped 
from the windows, ran through the streets, and ill their 
pain and frenzy flung themselves into the river. ; 1 

These were not all the horrors of* the- time. The wicked 
and dissolnte, in wild desperation, sat in the ta Verbs sing- 
ing roaring songs, and were striokeh as they drank, and 
went out and died. The fearful and superstitions persuaded 
themselves that they saw" supernatural < sights— burning 
swords in the sky, gigantic arms- ahd darts. Others pre- 
tended that at nights vast crowds of ghosts : walked round 
and round the dismal pits. One madman, naked, and car-- 
lying a brazier full of burning coals upon his head, stalked 
through the streets, crying out that hd was k Prophet, com : 
missioned to denounce the vengeance of the Lord on wicked 
London. Another always went to and fro, exclaiming, 
“Yet forty days, and London Shall' be destroyed ! ” A‘ 
third awoke the echoes in the dismal streets, by night ahd 
by day, and made the blood of the sick run cold, by calling 
out incessantly, in a deep hoarse voice, “O, the great and 
dreadful God ! ” 

Through the months of July and August and September, 
the Great Plague raged more and mere. Great fires were 
lighted in the streets, in the hope of stopping the infec- 
tion; but there was a plague of rain too, and it beat the 
fires out. At last, the winds which usually arise at that 
time of the year which is called the equinox, when day and 
njght are of equal length all over the world, began to blow, 
and to purify the wretched town- The deaths began to de- 
crease, the red crosses slowly to disappbar, the fugitives to 
return, the shops to open, pale frightened faces to be* seen 
in the streets. The Plague had been tneVery part, of Eng-

iflg tp their merry ways. So little humanity did the gov- 
ernment learn from the late affliction, that one of the first 
tilings the Parliament did Tfhen it met at Oxford (being as 
yet afraid to come to London), was to make a law, called 
the Five Mile Act, 'expressly directed against those poor 
ministers who, in time of the Plague, had manfully come 
back to comfort the unhappy people* This infamous law, 
by forbidding them to teach in any school, or to come 
within five miles of any city, town, or village, doomed 
them to starvation and death. 

The fleet had been at sea, and healthy. The King of 
France was now. in alliance with the Dutch, though his 
navy was chiefly employed in looking on while the English 
and Dutch fought* The Dutch gained one victory; and 
the English gained another and a greater; and Prince Ru- 
pert, one of the English admirals, was out in the Channel 
one windy night, looking for the French Admiral, with the 
intention of giving him something more to do than he had 
had yet, when the gale increased to a storm, and blew him 
into Saint Helen’s. That, night was the third of Septem- 
ber, one thousand six hundred and sixty-six, and that wind 
fanned the Great Fire of London. 

It broke out at a baker’s shop near London Bridge, on 
the spot on which, the Monument now stands as a remem- 
brance of those raging flames. It spread and spread, and 
burned and burned, for three days. The nights were 
lighter than the days ; in the daytime there was an immense 
cloud of smoke, and in the, night-time there was a great 
tower of fire mounting up into the sky, which lighted the 
whole country landscape for ten miles round. Showers of 
hot ashes rose into the air and fell on distant places ; flying 
sparks carried the conflagration to great distances, and 
kindled it in twenty new spots at a timfe; church steeples 
fell down with tremendous crashes ; houses crumbled into 
cinders by the hundred and the thousand. The summer 
had been intensely hot and dry, the streets were very 
narrow, and the houses mostly built of wood and plaster. 
Nothing could stop the tremendous fire* bat the want of 
more houses to burn; nor did it stop until the whole way 
from the Tower to Temple Bar was a desert, composed of 
the ashes of thirteen thousand houses and eighty-nine 
churches. 

This was a terrible visitation at the time* and occasioned

great loss and suffering to the two hundred thousand burnt-* 
out people, who were obliged to lie in the fields under the 
open night sky, or in hastily-made huts of mud and straw, 
while the lanes and roads were rendered impassable by 
carts which had broken down as they tried, to save their 
goods. Rut the Fire was a great blessing to the City after- 
wards, for it arose from its ruins very much improved — 
built more regularly, more widely, more: cleanly and care- 
fully^ and therefore much more healthily. It might be far 
more healthy than it is, but there are some people in it still 
—even now, at this time, nearly two hundred years later — 
so selfish, so pig-headed, and bo ignorant, that I doubt if 
even another Great Fire would warm them up to do their 
duty. 

The Catholics were accused of having wilfully set Lon- 
don in flames ; one poor Frenchman, who had been mad for 
years, even accused himself of having with his own hand 
fired the first house. There is no reasonable doubt, how- 
ever, that the fire was accidental. An inscription on the 
Monument long attributed it to the Catholics ; but it is re- 
moved now, and was always a malicious and stupid untruth. 

SECONO PART. 

That the Merry Monarch might be very merry indeed, in 
the merry times when his people were suffering under pes- 
tilence and fire, he drank and gambled and flung away 
among his favourites the money which the Parliament had 
voted for the war. The consequence of this was that the 
stout-hearted English sailors were merrily starving of want, 
and dying in the streets ; while the Dutch, under their ad- 
mirals De Witt and De Rutter, came into the river 
Thames, and up the river Medway as far as Upnor, burned 
the guard-ships* silenced the weak batteries, and did what 
they would to the English coast for six whole weeks. , Most 
of the English ships that could have prevented : them had 
neither powder nor shot on board 5 in this merry reign, 
public officers malde themselves as merry as the' King did 
with the public money ; and when it was entrusted to them 
to spend in national defences or preparation^, they put it 
into their own pockets with the merriest grace in the world. 

Lord Clarendon had, by this time, run as long U course

kings. He was impeached by his political opponents, but 
unsuccessfully. The King then commanded him to with- 
draw from England and retire to France, which he did, after 
defending himself in writing. He was no great loss at 
home, and died abroad some seven years afterwards. 

There then came into power a ministry called the Cabal 
Ministry, because it. was composed of Lord Clifford, the 
Earl of Arlington, the Duke of Buckingham (a great 
rascal, and the King’s most powerful favourite), Lord 
Ashley, and the Duke of Lauderdale, c. a. b. a. l. 
As the French were making conquests in Flanders, the hrst 
Cabal proceeding was to make a treaty with the Dutch^ for 
uniting with Spain to oppose the French. It was no sooner 
made than the Merry Monarch, who always wanted to get 
money without being accountable to a Parliament for his 
expenditure, apologised to the King of France for having 
had anything to do with it, and concluded a secret treaty 
with him, making himself his infamous pensioner to the 
amount of two millions of livres down, and three millions 
more a year; and engaging to desert that very Spain, to 
make war against those very Dutch, and to declare himself 
a Catholic when a convenient time should arrive. This 
religious King had lately been crying to his Catholic brother 
on the subject of his strong desire to be a Catholic ; and now 
he merrily concluded this treasonable conspiracy agaihst 
the country he governed, by undertaking to become one as 
soon as he safely could. For all of which, though he had 
had ten merry heads instead of one, he richly deserved to 
lose them by the headsman’s axe. 

As his one merry head might have been far from safe, if 
these things had been known, they were kept very quiet, 
and war was declared by France and England against the 
Dutch. But, a very uncommon man, afterwards most im- 
portant to English history and to the religion and liberty 
of this land, arose among them, and for many long years 
defeated the whole projects of France. This was William 
of Nassau, Prince of Orange, son of the last Prince of 
Orange of the same name, who married the daughter of 
Charles the First of England. He was a young man at 
this time; only jnst of age ; but he was brave, oool, intrepid, 
and wise. His father had been so detested that, upon his 
death; the Dutch had abolished the authority to which this 
son would have otherwise succeeded (Stadtholder it was

called), and placed the chief power in the hands of John 
dk Witt, who, educated this young prince. Now, the 
Prince became very popular, and John de Witt’s brother 
Cornelius was sentenced to banishment on a false accusa- 
tion of conspiring to kill him. John went to the prison 
where be was, to take him away to exile, in his coach ; and 
a great mob who collected on the occasion, then and there 
cruelly murdered both the brothers. This left the govern- 
ment in the hands of the Prince, who was really the choice 
of the nation; and from this time he exercised it with the 
greatest vigour, against the whole power of France, under 
its famous generals Cowni and Turjsnnb, and in support 
qf the Protestant religion. It was full seven years before 
this war ended in a treaty of peace made at Nimeguon, and 
its details would occupy a very considerable spaoe. It is 
enough to say that William of Orange established a famous 
character with the whole world; and that the Merry Mon- 
arch, adding to and improving on hie former baseness, 
bound himself to do everything the King of France liked, 
and nothing the King of France did not like, for a pension 
of one hundred thousand pounds a year, which was af- 
terwards doubled. Besides this, the King of France, by 
means of his corrupt ambassador~who wrote accounts of 
his proceedings in England, which are not always to be be- 
lieved, I think— bought our English members of -Parlia- 
ment, as he wanted them. So, in point of fact, during a 
considerable portion of this merry reign, the King of France 
was the real King of this country. 

But there was a better time to come, and it was to come 
(though his royal uncle little thought so) through that very 
William, Prince of Orange. He came over to England, 
saw Mary, the elder daughter of the Duke of York, and 
married her, We shall see by-and-bye what came of that 
marriage, and why it is never to be forgotten. 

This daughter was a Protestant, but her mother died a 
Catholic. She and her sister Anne, also a Protestant, 
were the only survivors of eight children. Anne after- 
wards married Gbokob, Prince of Denmark, brother ^ 
the King of that country.

supposing that he was even good humoured (exc* 
he had everything bis own way), or that lie was b 
iied and honourable, I will mention here what wa$

a member of the House of Commons, Sir John Coventry. 
He made a remark in a debate about taxing the theatres, 
which gave the King offence. The King agreed with his 
illegitimate son, who had been born abroad, and whom 
he had made Duke op Monmouth, to take the following 
merry vengeance. To waylay him at night, fifteen armed 
men to one, and to slit his nose with a penknife. Like 
master, like mam The King’s favourite, the Duke of 
Buckingham, was strongly suspected of setting on an assas- 
sin to murder the Duke op Ormond as he was returning 
home from a dinner; and that duke’s spirited son, Lord 
Ossory, was so persuaded of his guilt, that he said to him 
at Court, even as he stood beside the King, “ My lord, I 
know very well that you are at the bottom of this late 
attempt upon my father. But I give you warning, if he 
ever come to a violent end, his blood shall be upon you, 
and wherever I meet you I will pistol youf I will do bo, 
though I find you standing behind the King’s ehair; and I 
tell you this in his Majesty’s presence, that you may be 
quite sure of my doing what I threaten.” Those were 
merry times indeed. 

There was a fellow named Blood, who was seized for 
making, with two companions, an audacious attempt to 
steal the crown, the globe, and sceptre, from the place 
where the jewels were kept in the Tower. This robber, 
who was a swaggering ruffian, being taken, declared that 
he was the man who had endeavoured to kill the Duke of 
Ormond, and that he had meant to kill the King too, but 
was overawed by the majesty of his appearance, when he 
might otherwise have done it, as he was bathing at Batter- 
sea. The King being but an ill-looking fellow, I don’t be- 
lieve a word of this. Whether he tras flattered, or whether 
he knew that Buckingham had really set Blood on to mur- 
der the duke, is uncertain. But it is quite certain that he 
pardoned this thief, gave him an estate of five hundred a 
year in Ireland (which had had the honour of giving him 
birth), and presented him at Court to the debauched lords 
and the shameless ladies, who made a great deal of him — 
as I have no doubt they would have made of the devil him- 
self, if the King had introduced him. 

Infamously pensioned as he was, the King still wanted 
money, and consequently was obliged to call Parliaments. 
In these, the great object of the Protestants was to thwart

tye Catholic Duke ofYork, who . married a second timer, 
his new wife being a young lady only fifteen years old, 
the Catholic sister of the Dure of Modena. In. this they 
were seconded by the Protestant dissenters, though to their 
own disadvantage : since, to exclude Catholics from power, 
they, were even willing to exclude themselves. The King’s 
object was to , pretend to be a Protestant, while he was 
really a Catholic; to swear to the bishops that he was der 
voutly attached to the English Church, while he knew he 
had bargained it away, to the King of France; and, by 
cheatiug and deceiving them, and all who were attached to 
royalty, to become despotic and be powerful enough to con- 
fess what a rascal he was. Meantime, the King of France, 
knowing his merry pensioner well, intrigued with the 
King’s opponents in Parliament, as well as with the King 
and his friends. 

The fears that the country had of the Catholie religion 
being restored, .if the Duke of York should come to the 
throne, and the low cunning of. the King in pretending to 
share their alarms, led to some very terrible results. A 
certain Dr. Tonge, a dull clergyman in the City, felLinto 
the hands of a certain Titus Oates, a most inf amous char- 
acter, who pretended to have acquired ^amoiig the Jesuits 
abroad a r knowledge Of a great plot for the murder of the 
King, and the re-establishment of the Catholic religion. 
Titus Oates, being produced by this unlucky Dr. Tonge and 
solemnly examined before the Council, contradicted, himself 
in a thousand ways, told the most ridiculous and improba- 
ble stories, and implicated Codeican, the Secretary of the 
Duchess of York. Now, although what he charged against 
Coleman was not true, and although you and I know very 
well that the real dangerous Catholic plot was that * ohe 
with the King of France of which the Merry Monarch was 
himself the, head, there happened to be found among Cole- 
man’s papers, some letters, in which he did praise the days 
of Bloody Queen Mary, and abuse, the Protestant, religion. 
This was great good fortune for Titus, as it seemed to con- 
firm him; but better still was in store. , Sib. Edmundbdry 
Godfrey, the magistrate who had first examined him, be* 
ing unexpectedly found dead near PrimrOee Hill, was con- 
fidently believed to haVB been killed by the Catholics. I 
think there is.no doubt that he had been melancholy mad, 
and that he killed himself; but he had a* great Protestant

funeral, and Titus was called the Saver of the Nation, and 
received a pension of twelve hundred pounds a year. 

As soon as Oates’s wickedness had met with this success, 
up Started another villain, named* William Bedloe, who, 
attracted by a reward of five hundred pounds offered for 
the apprehension of the murderers of Godfrey, came for- 
ward and charged two Jesuits and some other persons with 
having committed it at the Queen’s desire. Oates, going 
into partnership with this new informer, had the audacity 
to accuse the poor Queen herself of high treason. Then 
appeared a third informer, as bad as either of the two, and 
accused a Catholic banker named Stayley of having said 
that the King was the greatest rogue in the world (which 
would not have been far from the truth), and that he 
would kill him with his own hand. This banker, being at 
once tried and executed, Coleman and two others were tried 
and executed. Then, a miserable wretch named Prance, 
a Catholic silversmith, being accused by Bedloe, was tor- 
tured into confessing that he had taken part in Godfrey’s 
murder, and into accusing three other men of having com- 
mitted it. Then, five Jesuits were accused by Oates, Bed- 
loe, and Prance together, and were all found guilty, and 
executed on the same kind of contradictory and absurd evi- 
dence. The Queen’s physician and three monks were next 
put on their trial; but Oates and Bedloe had for the time 
gone far enough, and these four were acquitted. The pub- 
lic mind, however, was so full of a Catholic plot, and so 
strong against the Duke of York, that James consented to 
obey a written order from his brother, and to go with his 
family to Brussels, provided that his rights should never be 
sacrificed in his absence to the Duke of Monmouth. The 
House of Commons, not satisfied with this as the King 
hoped, passed a bill to exclude the duke from ever succeed- 
ing to the throne. In return, the King dissolved the Par- 
liament. He had deserted his old favourite, the Duke of 
Buckingham, who was now in the opposition. 

To give any sufficient idea of the miseries of Scotland in 
this merry reign, would occupy a hundred pages. Because 
the people would net have bishops, and were resolved to 
stand by their solemn League and Covenant, such cruelties 
were inflicted upon them as make the blood run cold. Fe- 
rocious dragoons galloped through the country to punish 
the peasants for deserting the churches; sons were hanged

up at their fathers’ doors for refusing to disclose Where 
their fathers were concealed; wires were tortured to death 
for not betraying their hnsbands; people were taken out of 
their fields and gardens, and shot on the public roads with* 
out trial; lighted matches were tied to the fingers of pris- 
oners, and a most horrible torment called the Boot was in* 
vented, and constantly applied, whieh ground and mashed 
the victims’ legs with iron wedges. Witnesses were tor- 
tured as well as prisoners. All the prisons were full; all 
the gibbets were heavy with bodies; murder and plunder 
devastated the whole country. In spite of all, the Cove- 
nanters were by no means to be dragged into the churches, 
and persisted in worshipping God as they thought right. 
A body of ferocious Highlanders, turned upon them from 
the mountains of their own country, had no greater effect 
than the English dragoons under Grahams of Claver- 
house, the most cruel and rapacious of all their enemies, 
whose name will ever be cursed through the length and 
breadth of Scotland. Archbishop Sharp had Over aided 
and abetted all these outrages. But he fell at last; for, 
when the injuries of the Scottish people were at their 
height, he was seen, in his coach-and-six coming across a 
moor, by a body of men, headed by one John Balfour, 
who were waiting for another of their oppressors. Upon 
this they cried out that Heaven had delivered him into 
their hands, and killed him with many wounds. If ever a 
man deserved such a death, I think Archbishop Sharp did. 

It made a great noise directly, and the Merry Monarch 
— strongly suspected of having goaded the Scottish people 
on, that hO might have an excuse for a greater army than 
the Parliament were willing to give him — sent down his 
son, the Duke of Monmouth, as commander-in-chief, with 
instructions to attack the Scottish rebels, or Whigs as they 
were called, whenever he came up with them. Marching 
with ten thousand men from Edinburgh, he found them, in 
number four or five thousand, drawn up at Both well Bridge, 
.by the Clyde. They were soon dispersed; and Monmouth 
showed a more humane character towards them, than he 
had shown towards that Member of Parliament whose nose 
he had caused to be slit with a penknife. But the Duke of 
Lauderdale was their bitter foe, and sent Claverhouse to 
finish them. 

As the Duke of York became more and more unpopular,

the Duke of Monmouth became more and more popular. 
It would have been decent in the latter not to have voted 
in favour of the renewed: bill for the exclusion of James 
from the throne; but he did so, much to the King’s amuse* 
ment, who used to sit in the House of Lords by the fire, 
hearing the debates, which he said were as good as a play. 
The House of Commons passed the bill by a large majority, 
and it was carried up to the House of Lords by Lord Rus- 
sell, one of the best of the leaders on the Protestant side. 
It was rejected there, chiefly because the bishops helped the 
King to get rid of it; and the fear of Catholic plots revived 
again. There had been another got up, by a fellow out of 
Newgate, named Dangerfield, which is more famous than 
it deserves to be, under the name of the Meal-Tub Plot. 
This jail-bird having been got out of Newgate by a Mrs. 
Cellier, a Catholic nurse, had turned Catholic himself, 
and pretended that he knew of a plot among the Presbyte- 
rians against the King’s life. This was very pleasant 
to the Duke of York, who hated the Presbyterians, who 
returned the compliment. He gave Dangerfield twenty 
guineas, and sent him to the King his brother. But 
Dangerfield, breaking down altogether in his charge, and 
being sent back to Newgate, almost astonished the duke 
out of his five senses by suddenly swearing that the Catho- 
lic nurse had put that false design into his head, and that 
what he Teally knew about, was, a Catholic plot against the 
King; the evidence of which would be found in some 
papers, concealed in a meal-tub in Mrs. Cellier’ s house. 
There they were, of course — for he had put them there 
himself — and so the tub gave the name to the plot. But, 
the nurse was acquitted on her trial, and it came to 
nothing. 

Lord Ashley, the Cabal, was now Lord Shaftesbury, and 
was strong against the succession of the Duke of York. 
The House of Commons, aggravated to the utmost extent, 
as we may well suppose, by suspicions of the King’s con- 
spiracy with the King of France, made a desperate point 
of the exclusion still, and were bitter against the Catholics 
generally. So unjustly bitter were they, I grieve to say, 
that they impeached the venerable Lord Stafford, a Catholic 
nobleman seventy years 1 old, of a design to kill the King. 
The witnesses were that atrocious Oates and two ■■other 
birds of the same feather. He was found

denpe quite as foolish as it was false, and was beheaded 
on Tower Hill. . The people were opposed to him when he 
first appeared upon the scaffold; but, when he had ad- 
dressed them and shown them how innocent he was. and 
how wickedly he was sent there, their better nature was 
aroused, and they said, “ We believe you, my Lord. . God 
bless you, my Lord ! ” 

The House of Commons refused to let the King have any 
money until he should consent to the Exclusion Bill; but, 
as he could get it and did get it from his master the King 
of France, he could afford to hold them very cheap. He 
called a Parliament at Oxford, to which he went down with 
a great show of being armed and protected as if he were in 
danger of his life, and to which the opposition members 
also went armed and protected, alleging that they were in 
fear of the Papists, who were numerous among the King’s 
guards. However, they Went On with the Exclusion Bill, 
and were so earnest upon it that they would have carried 
it again, if the King .had not popped his crown and state 
robes into a sedan-chair, bundled himself into it along with 
them, hurried down to the chamber where the House of 
Lords met, and dissolved the Parliament. After which ho 
scampered home, and the members of Parliament scampered 
home too, as fast as their legs could carry them* : 

The Puke of York, then residing.in Scotland, had, under 
the law which excluded Catholics from publio trust, no 
right whatever to publio employment. Nevertheless, he 
was openly employed as the King’s representative in Scot-: 
land, and there gratified his sullen and cruel, nature to fiia 
heart’s content by directing the dreadful cruelties against 
the Covenanters. There wore , two ministers named Car- 
gill and Cameron who had escaped from the battle of 
Both well Bridge, and who returned to Scotland, and raised 
the miserable^ but still brave and unsubdued Covenanters 
afresh, under the name of Cameronians. , As Cameron pubr 
licly posted a declaration that the King was a forsworn 
tyrant, no mercy was shown, to his unhappy followers after 
he was slain in battle. The Duke of York, who was , par- 
ticularly fond of the Boot and derived great pleasure from 
having it applied, offered their lives to some of these peo- 
ple, if they would ory on the scaffold “ God save the King ! ”, 

But their relations, frie*^ 0 **ymen„ had been. so.

they preferred to die, and did die. The duke then obtained 
his merry brother's permission to hold a Parliament in 
Scotland, which first, with most shameless deceit, confirmed 
the laws for seeming the Protestant religion against Pop- 
ery, and then declared that nothing must or should prevent 
the succession of the Popish duke. After this double-faced 
beginning, it established an oath which no human being 
could understand, but which everybody was to take, as a 
proof that his religion was the lawful religion. The Earl 
of Argyle, taking it with the explanation that he did not 
consider it to prevent him from favouring any alteration 
either in the Church or State which was not inconsistent 
with the Protestant religion or with his loyalty, was tried 
for high treason before a Scottish jury of which the Mar- 
quis op Montrose was foreman, and was found guilty. 
He escaped the scaffold, for that time, by getting away, in 
the disguise of a page, in the train of his daughter, Lady 
Sophia Lindsay. It was absolutely proposed, by certain 
members of the Scottish Council, that this lady should be 
whipped through the streets of Edinburgh. But this was 
too much even for the duke, who had the manliness then 
(he had very little at most times) to remark that English- 
men were not accustomed to treat ladies in that manner. 
In those merry times nothing could equal the brutal ser- 
vility of the Scottish fawners, but the conduct of similar 
degraded beings in England. 

After the settlement of these little affairs, the duke re- 
turned to England, and soon resumed his place at the Coun- 
cil, and his office of High Admiral — all this by his broth- 
er’s favour, and in open defiance of the law. It would 
have been no loss to the country, if he had been drowned 
when his ship, in going to Scotland to fetch his family, 
struck on a sand-bank, and was lost with two hundred souls 
on board. But he escaped in a boat with some friends; 
and the sailors were so brave and unselfish, that, when 
they saw him rowing away, they gave three cheers, while 
they themselves were going down for ever. 

The Merry Monarch, having got rid of his Parliament, 
went to work to make h’ nself despotic, with all speed. 
Having had the villany to order the execution of Olivku 
Plunket, Bishop of Armagh, falsely accused of a plot to 
establish Popery in that country by means of a French 
aruiy — the very thing this royal traitor was himself trying

to do at home — and having tried to ruin Lord Shaftesbury, 
and failed — he turned his hand to controlling the corpora- 
tions all over the country ; because, if he could only do 
that, he could get what juries he chose, to bring in perjured 
verdicts, and could get what members he chose, returned 
to Parliament. These merry times produced, and made 
Chief Justice of the Court of King’s Bench, a drunken ruff- 
ian of the name of Jeffreys; a red-faced swollen bloated 
horrible creature, with a bullying roaring voice, and a 
more savage nature perhaps than was ever lodged in any 
human breast. This monster was the Merry Monarch’s 
especial favourite, and he testified his admiration of him 
by giving him a ring from his own finger, which the peo- 
ple used to call J udge Jeffreys’s Bloodstone. Him the King 
employed to go about and bully the corporations, beginning 
with London; or, as Jeffreys himself elegantly called it, 
u to give them a lick with the rough side of his tongue.” 
And he did it so thoroughly, that they soon became the 
basest and most sycophantic bodies in the kingdom — except 
the University of Oxford, which, in that respect, was quite 
pre-eminent and unapproachable. 

Lord Shaftesbury (who died soon after the King’s fail- 
ure against him), Lord William Bussell, the Duke of 
Monmouth, Lord Howard, Lord Jersey, Algernon* 
Sidney, John Hampden (grandson of the great Hampden), 
and some others, used to hold a council together after tbs 
dissolution of the Parliament, arranging what it might be 
necessary to do, if the King carried his Popish plot to the 
utmost height. Lord Shaftesbury having been much the 
most violent of this party, brought two violent men into* 
their secrets — Rumsey, who had been a soldier in the Re- 
publican army; and West, a lawyer. These two knew an 
old officer of Cromwell’s, called Rumbold, who had mar- 
ried a maltster’s widow, and so had come into possession of 
a solitary dwelling called the Bye House, near Hoddesdon, 
in Hertfordshire. Rumbold said to them what a capital 
place this house of his would be from which to shoot at the 
King, who often passed there going to and fro from New- 
market. They liked the idea, and entertained it. But,* 
one of their body gave information ; and they, together 
with Shepherd a wine merchant, Lord Russell, Algernon 
Sidney. Lord Essex, Lord Howard, and Hampden, were

. Lord Russell might have easily escaped, but scorned to 
do so, being innocent of any wrong ; Lord Essex might 
have easily escaped, but scorned to do so, lest his flight 
should prejudice Lord Russell. But it weighed upon his 
mind that he had brought into their council, Lord Howard 
— who now turned a miserable traitor — against a great dis- 
like Lord Russell had always had of him. He cotild not 
bear the reflection, and destroyed himself before Lord Rus- 
sell was brought to trial at the Old Bailey. 

He knew very well that he had nothing to hope, having 
always been manful in the Protestant cause against the two 
false brothers, the one on the throne, and the other stand- 
ing next to it. He had a wife, one of the noblest and best 
of women, who acted as his secretary on his trial, who 
comforted him in his prison, who supped with him on the 
night before he died, and whose love and virtue and devo- 
tion have made her name imperishable. Of course, he was 
found guilty, and was: sentenced to be beheaded in Lincoln's 
Inn-fields, not many yards from his own house. When he 
had parted from his children on the evening before his 
death, his wife still stayed with him until ten o'clock at 
night; and when their final separation in this world was 
over, and he, had kissed her maUy times, he still sat for a 
long while in his prison, talking of her goodness. Hearing 
the rain fall fast at that time, he calmly said, “ Such a 
rain to-morrow will spoil a great show, which is a dull 
thing on a rainy day." At midnight he went to bed, and 
slept till four ; even when his servant called him, he fell 
asleep again while his clothes were being made ready. He 
rode to the scaffold in his own carriage, attended by two 
famous clergymen, Tillotson and Burnet, and sang a 
psalm to himself very softly, as he went along. He was as 
quiet and as steady as if he had been going out for an or- 
dinary ride. After saying that he was surprised to see so 
great a crowd, he laid down his head upon the block, as if 
upon the pillow of his bed, and had it struck off at the 
second blow. His noble wife was busy for him even then ; 
for that true-hearted lady printed and widely circulate d his 
last words, of which he hail given her a copy They made 
the blood of all the honest men in England boil. 

The University of Oxford distinguished itself 01 1 
same day by pretending to believe that the accusation 
against Lord Russell was true, and by calling the King,

in a written paper, the Breath of their Nostrils and the 
Anointed of the Lord. This paper the Parliament after- 
wards caused to be burned by the common hangman ; which 
I am sorry for, as I wish it had been framed and glazed 
and hung up in some public place, as a monument of base- 
ness for the scorn of mankind. 

Next, came the trial of Algernon Sidney, at which Jef- 
freys presided, like a great crimson toad, sweltering and 
swelling with rage. “I pray God, Mr. Sidney,” said this 
Chief Justice of a merry reign, after passing sentence, “ to 
work in you a temper fit to go to the other world, for I see 
you are hot fit for this.” “My lord,” said the prisoner, 
composedly holding out his arm, “feel my pulse, and see if 
I be disordered. I thank Heaven I never was in better 
temper than I am now.’ ; Algernon Sidney was executed 
on Tower Hill, on the seventh of December, oue thousand 
six hundred and eighty-three. He died a hero, and died, 
in his own words, “ For that good old cause in which he 
had been engaged from his • youth, and for which God had 
so often and so wonderfully declared himself.” 

The Duke of Monmouth had been making his uncle, the 
Duke of York, very jealous, by going about the country in 
a royal sort of way, playing at the people’s games, becom- 
ing godfather to their children, and even touching for the 
King’s evil, or stroking the faces of the Sick to cure them 
— though, for the matter of that, I should say he did them 
about as much good as any crowned king could, have done. 
His father had got him to write a letter, confessing his 
having had a part in the conspiracy, for which Lord.Rus- 
sell had been beheaded ; but he was ever a weak man, and 
as soon as he had written it, he was ashamed of it and got 
it back again. For this, he was banished to the Netherr 
lands ; but he soon returned and had an interview with his 
father, unknown to his uncle. It would seem that he was 
coming into the Merry Monarch’s favour again, and that 
the Duke of York was sliding out of it, when Death ap- 
peared to the merry galleries at Whitehall, and astonished 
the debauched lords and gentlemen, and the shameless 
ladies, very considerably. 

On Monday, the second of February, one thousand six 
hundred and eighty-five, the merry pensioner and servant 
of the King of France fell down in a fit of apoplexy. By 
the Wednesday his case was hopeless, and on the Thursday

he was told 60. As he made a difficulty about taking the 
sacrament from the Protestant Bishop of Bath, the Duke 
of York got all Who were present away from the bed, and 
asked his brother, in a whisper, if he should send for 
a Catholic priest? The Bang replied, “For God’s sake, 
brother, do ! ” The duke smuggled in, up the back stairs, 
disguised in a wig and gown, a priest named Huddleston, 
who had saved the King’s life after the battle of Worces- 
ter; telling him that this worthy man in the wig had onoe 
saved his body, and was now come to save his soul. 

The Merry Monarch lived through that night, and died 
before noon on the next day, which was Friday, the sixth. 
Two of the last things he said were of a human sort, and 
your remembrance will give him the full benefit of them. 
When the Queen sent to say she was too unwell to attend 
him and to ask his pardon, he said, “Alas! poor woman, 
ske beg my pardon! I beg hers with all my heart. Take 
back that answer to her.” And he also said, in reference 
to Nell Gwyn, “Do not let poor Nelly starve.” 

He died in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty- 
fifth of his reign. 


CHAPTER XXXVI. 

ENGLAND UNDER JAMES THE SECOND, 

Kino James the Second was a man so very disagree- 
able, that even the best of historians has favoured his 
brother Charles, as becoming, by comparison, quite a pleas- 
ant character. The one object of his short reign was to 
re-establish the Catholic religion in England; and this he 
doggedly pursued with such a stupid obstinacy, that his 
career very soon came to a close. 

The first thing he did, was, to assure his Council that he 
would make it his endeavour to preserve the Government, 
both in Church and State, as it was by law established; 
and that he would always take care to defend and support 
the Church. Great public acclamations were raised over 
this fail* speech, and a great deal was said, from the pul- 
pits and elsewhere, about the word of a king whifth vrgs 
never broken, by credulous people who little sftpfSMAtiMk

he had formed a secret Council for Catholie affairs, of 
which a mischievous Jesuit, called Father Petr®, was 
one of the ohief members. With tears of joy in his eyes, 
he received, as the beginning of his pension from the Ring 
of France, five hundred thousand livres; yet, with a mix- 
ture of meanness and arrogance that belonged to his con- 
temptible character, he was always jealous of making some 
show of being independent of the King of France, while he 
pocketed his money. As~notwithstandin g his publishing 
two papers in favour of Popery (and not likely to do it 
much service, I should think) written by the King, his 
brother, and found in his strong-box ; and his open display 
of himself attending mass — the Parliament was very obse- 
quious, and granted him a large sum of money, he began 
his reign with a belief that he could do what he pleased, 
and with a determination to do it. 

Before we proceed to its principal events, let us dispose 
of Titus Oates. He was tried for perjury, a fortnight af- 
ter the coronation, and besides being very heavily fined, 
was sentenced to stand twice in the pillory, to be whipped 
from Aldgate to Newgate one day, and front Newgate to 
Tyburn two days afterwards, and to stand in the pillory 
five tunes a year as long as he lived. This fearful sentence 
was actually inflicted on the rascal. Being unable to stand 
after his first flogging, he was dragged on a sledge from 
Newgate to Tyburn, and flogged as he was drawn along. 
He was so strong a villain thatihe did npt die under the 
torture, but lived to be afterwards pardoned and rewarded, 
though not to be ever believed in any more. Dangerfield, 
the only other one of that crew left alive, was not eo fortu- 
nate. He was almost killed by a whipping from Newgate 
to Tyburn, and, as if that were not punishment enough, a 
ferocious barrister of Gray's Inn gave him a poke in the 
eye with his cane, which caused his death ; for which the 
ferocious barrister was deservedly tried and executed. 

As soon as James was on the throne, Argyle and Mon- 
mouth went from Brussels to Rotterdam, and attended a 
meeting of Scottish exiles held therfc, to concert measures 
for a rising in England. It was agreed that Argyle Bhonld 
effect a landing in Scotland, and Monmouth in England; 
and that two Englishmen should be sent with Argyle to be 
in his confidence, and two Scotchmen with the Duke of 
Monmouth*

Argyle was the first to act upon this contract. But, two 
of his men being taken prisoners at the Orkney Islands, the 
Government became aware of his intention, and was able 
to aict against him with such vigour as 1 6 prevent his rais- 
ing more than two or three thousand Highlanders, although 
he sent a fiery cross, by trusty messengers, from clan to 
clan and from glen to glen, as the custom then was when 
those wild people were to be excited by their chiefs. As 
he was moving towards Glasgow with his small force, he 
was betrayed by some of his followers, taken, and carried, 
with his hands tied behind his back, to his old prison in 
Edinburgh Castle. James ordered him to be executed, on 
his old shamefully unjust sentence, within three days ; and 
he appears to have been anxious that his legs Bhould haye 
been pounded with his old favourite the boot. However, 
the boot was not applied; he was simply beheaded, and his 
head was set upon the top pf Edinburgh Jail. One of 
those Englishmen who had been assigned to him was that 
old soldier Rumbold, the master of the Rye House. He 
was sorely wounded, and within a week after Argyle had 
suffered with great courage, was brought up for trial, lest 
he should die and disappoint the King< He, too, was exe- 
cuted, after defending himself with great spirit, and say- 
ing that he did not believe that God had made the greater 
part of mankind to carry saddles on their backs and bridles 
in their mouths, and to be ridden: by a few, booted and 
spurred for the purpose — in which I thoroughly agree with 
Rumbold. 

The Duke of Monmouth, partly through being detained 
and partly through idling his time away, was five or six 
weeks behind his friend when he landed at Lyme, in Dor- 
set: having at his right hand an unlucky nobleman called 
Lord Grey op Werk, who of himself would have ruined 
a far more promising expedition. He immediately set up 
his standard in the market-place, and proclaimed the King 
a tyrant, and a Popish usurper, and I know not what else; 
charging him, not only with what he had done, which was 
bad enough, but with what neither he nor anybody else 
had done, stich as setting fire to London, and poisoning 
the late King. Raising some four thousand men by these 
means, he marched on to Taunton, where there wear© many 
Protestant dissenters who were strongly opposed tip fle 
Catholics. Here, both the rich and poor tiurm * 1 mttto

receive him, ladies waved, a welcome to him from all the 
windows ashe passed along the streets, flowers were 
strewn in. his way, and overy compliment and honour that 
could be devised was showered upon him. Among the 
rest, twenty: young ladies came forward, in their best 
clothes, and in their brightest beauty, and gave him a. Bi- 
ble ornamented with their own fair hands, together with 
other presents. 

Encouraged by this homage, he proclaimed himself King, 
and went on to Bridgewater. But, here the Government 
troops, under the Earl op Feversham, were close at hand; 
and >he was so dispirited at finding that he made but few 
powerful friends after all, that it was a question whether 
he should disband his army and endeavour to escape. It 
was resolved, at the instance of that unlucky Lord Grey, to 
make a night attack on the King’s army, as it lay ent- 
carnped on the edge of a morass called Sedgemoor. The 
horsemen were commanded by the same unlucky lord, who 
was not a brave man. He gave up the battle almost at the 
first obstacle* — which was a deep drain ; and although the 
poor countrymen, who hjad turned out for Monmouth, 
fought bravely with scythes, poles, pitchforks, and such 
poor weapons as they had, they were soon dispersed by the 
trained soldiers, and fled in all directions. When the 
Duke of Monmouth himself fled, was not known in the con- 
fusion ; but the unlucky Lord Grey was taken early next 
day, and then another of the party was taken, who con* 
fessed that he had parted from the duke only four hcmrs 
before. Strict Search being made, he was found disguised 
as a peasant, hidden in a ditch under fern and nettles, with 
a few peas in his pocket which he had gathered in the fields 
to eat. The only other articles he had upon him were a 
few papers and little books: one of the latter being a 
strange jumble, in his own writing, of charms, songs, reci- 
pes, and prayers. He was completely broken. He wrote 
a miserable letter to the King, beseeching and entreating 
to be allowed to see him. When he was taken to London, 
and conveyed bound into the King’s presence, he crawled 
to him on his knees, and made a most degrading exhibi- 
tion. As James never forgave or relented towards anybody; 
he was not likely to soften towards the issuer of the Lyme 

p r/ w.i — so he told t 1 l; ant to prepare for death.

eighty-five, this unfortunate favourite of the people was 
brought out to die on Tower Hill, The crowd was im- 
mense, and the tops of all the houses were covered with 
gazers. He had seen his wife, the daughter of the Duke 
of Buccleuch, in the Tower, and had talked much of a lady 
whom he loved far better— the Laoy Harriet Went- 
worth— who was one of the last persons he remembered in 
this life. Before laying down his head upon the block he 
felt the edge of the axe, and told the executioner that he 
feared it was not sharp enough, and that the axe was not 
heavy enough. On the executioner replying that it was of 
the proper kind, the duke said, a I pray you have a care, 
and do not use me so awkwardly as you used my Lord 
Bussell.” The executioner, made nervous by this, and 
trembling, struck once and merely gashed him in the neck. 
Upon this, the Duke of Monmouth raised his head and 
looked the man reproachfully in the face. Then he struck 
twice, and then thrice, and then threw down the axe, and 
cried out in a voice of horror that he could not finish that 
work. The sheriffs, however, threatening him with what 
should be done to himself if he did not, he took it up again 
and struck a fourth time and a fifth time. Then the 
wretched head at last fell off, and James, Duke of Mon- 
mouth, was dead, in the thirty-sixth year of his age. He 
was a showy graceful man, with many popular qualities, 
and had found much favour in the open hearts of the Eng- 
lish. 

The atrocities, committed by the Government, which fol- 
lowed this Monmouth Rebellion, form the blackest and most 
lamentable page in English history. The poor peasants, 
having been dispersed with great loss, and their leaders 
having been taken, one Would think that the implacable 
King might have been satisfied. But no ; he let loose upon 
them, among other intolerable monsters, a Colonel Kirk, 
who had served against the Moors, and whose soldiers — 
called by the people Kirk’s lambs, because they bore a 
lamb upon their flag, as the emblem of Christianity — were 
worthy of their leader. The atrocities committed by these 
demons in human shape are far too horrible to be related 
here. It is enough to say, that besides most ruthlessly 
murdering and robbing them, and ruining them by making 
them buy their pardons at the price of all they possessed, 
it was one of Kirk’s favourite amusements, as he and his

officers sat drinking after dinner^ and toasting the King, to 
have batches of prisoners hanged outside the Windows for 
the company's diversion ; and that when their feet quiv- 
ered in the convulsions of death* he used to swear that 
they should have music to their dancing, and would order 
the drums to beat and the trumpets to play, 'the detesta* 
ble King informed him, as an acknowledgment of these 
services, that he was 4< Very well satisfied with his proceed* 
lugs.” But the King's great delight Was in the proceed- 
ings of Jeffreys, now a peer, who went down into the west, 
with four other judges, to try persons accused of having 
had any share in the rebellion. The King pleasantly 
called this “JeffreyS's campaign.” The people down in 
that part of the country remember it to this day as The 
Bloody Assize* 

It began at Winchester, where a poor deaf old lady, 
Mbs* Alicia Lirle, the widow of one of the judges of 
Charles the First (who had been murdered abroad by some 
Royalist assassins), was charged With having given shelter 
in her house to two fugitives from Sedgemoor. Three 
times the juiy refused to find her guilty, until Jeffreys 
bullied and frightened them into that false verdict. When 
he had extorted it fr6m them, he said, “ Gentlemen, if I 
bad been one of you, and she had been my own mother, I 
would have found her guilty 5 ” — as I dare say he would. 
He sentenced her to be burned alive, that Very afternoon. 
The clergy of the cathedral and some others Interfered in 
her favour, and she was beheaded within a week. As a 
high mark of his approbation, the King made Jeffreys 
Lord Chancellor ; and he then went on to Dorchester, to 
Exeter, to Taunton, and to Wells. It is astonishing, when 
we read of the enormous injustice and barbarity of this 
beast, to know that no one struck him dead on the judg- 
ment-seat. It was enodgh for any man or woman to be ac- 
cused by an enemy, before Jeffreys, to be found guilty of 
high treason. One man who pleaded not guilty, he ordered 
to be taken out of court upon the instant, and hanged; and 
this so terrified the prisoners in general that they mostly 
pleaded guilty at once. At Dorchester alone, in the course 
of a few days, Jeffreys hanged eighty people; besides 
whipping, transporting, imprisoning, and selling as slaves, 
great numbers. He executed, in all, two hundred and 
fifty, or three hundred*

These executions took place, among the neighbours and 
friends of the sentenced, iu thirty-six towns and villages. 
Their bodies were mangled, steeped in caldrons of boiling 
pitch and tar, and hung up by the roadsides, in the streets, 
over the very churches. The sight and smell of heads and 
limbs, the, hissing and bubbling of the infernal caldrons, 
and the tears and terrors of the people, were dreadful be- 
yond all description. * One rustic, who was forced to steep 
the remains in the black pot, was ever afterwards called 
“ Tom Boilman. ” The hangman has ever . since been called 
Japk Ketch, because a man of that name Went hanging and 
hanging, all day long, in the train of Jeffreys. You will 
hear much of the horrors of the great French Revolution. 
Many and terrible they were, there is no doubt ; but I know 
of nothing worse, done by the maddened people of France 
in that awful time, than was done by the highest judge in 
England, with the express approval of the King of England, 
in The Bloody Assize. 

Nor was even this all. : Jeffreys was as fond of money 
for himself as of misery for others, and he sold pardons 
wholesale to fill his pockets. The King ordered, at one 
time, a thousand prisoners to be given to certain of his 
favourites, iu order that they might bargain with them for 
thpir pardons. The yotmg ladies: of TauutOn who had pre-» 
seated the Bible, were bestowed upon the maids of honour 
at court ; and those precious ladies made very hard bar- 
gains with them indeed. When The Bloody Assize was at 
its most dismal height, the King was diverting himself .with 
horse-races in the very place where Mrs. Lisle had been 
executed. When Jeffreys had done his worst, and came 
home again, he was particularly complimented in the Royal 
Gazette ; and when the King heard that through drunken- 
ness and raging he was very ill, hds odious Majesty re- 
marked that such another man could not easily be found 
in England. Besides all this, a former sheriff of London, 
named Cok^ish, was hanged within sight of his own house, 
after an abominably conducted trial, for having had a share 
in the Rye House Plot, on evidence given by Rumsey, 
which that villain was obliged to confess was directly 
opposed to the evidence he had given on the trial of Lord 
Russell. And on the very same day, a worthy widow, 
named Elizabeth Gaunt, was burned alive at Tyburn, for 
having sheltered a wretch who himself gave eVidende against

hands, so that the- flames should reach her quickly; and 
nobly said,’ with her last breath, that she had obeyed the 
sacred command of God* togiv© refuge tb the outcast, and 
not to betray the wanderet. 

After all this hanging, beheading; burning* boiling, mu- 
tilating, exposing, robbing, transporting, and selling into 
slavery, of his \inhappy subjects* the King not unnaturally 
thought that he could: do whatever h© would; So, he went 
to work to change the ieligkjn of the country with all pos- 
sible speed ; and what he did was this*

lic employments^by his own power of dispensing, with the 
penalties* He tried it in cm© case, :and> eleven of the

kept in their places and sanctioned. He revived the hated 
Ecclesiastical Commission, to get rid of Compton, Bishop 
of London* who manfully opposed him. He sblicited ithe 
Pope to favour England with an ambassador* which the 
Pope ( who was a sensible man then) rather unwillingly did. 
He flourished Father Petre before the eyes of the people 
on all possible occasions. He favoured' the establishment 
of convents in several parts of iLoudoh. He was delighted 
to have the streets, and eved the Court itself, filled' with 
Monks and Friars in the habitd of their orders. He con- 
stantly endeavoured to make Catholics of the Protestants 
about him. He held private interviews, which he called 
“ closetings,” with those Members of Parliament who held 
offices, to persuade them to consent to the design he had in 
view. When, they did nbt consent, they were removed, 
or resigned of themselves, and their places were given to 
Catholics. He displaced ; Protestant officers from the army, 
by every means in his power* and got Catholics into their 
places too.. He tried the same thing with the corporations, 
and also (though not so successfully) with the Lord Lieu* 
tenants of counties. To terrify the people into the endur- 
ance of all these measures, he kept an army of fifteen 
thousand men encamped on Hounslow Heath, where mass 
was openly performed in the General’s tent, and where 
priests wCnt among the soldiers endeavouring to persuade

them to become Catholics. For circulating a paper among 
those men advising them to be true to their religion, a 
Protestant clergyman, named Johnson, the chaplain of the 
late Lord Russell, was actually sentenced to stand three 
times in the pillory, and was actually whipped from New* 
gate to Tyburn. He dismissed his own brother-in-law 
from his Council because he was a Protestant, and made a 
Privy Councillor of the before-mentioned Father Petre. 
He handed Ireland over to Richard Talbot, Earl of 
Tyrconnbll, a worthless, dissolute knave, who played 
the same game there for his master, and who played the 
deeper game for himself of one day putting it under the 
protection of the French King. In going to these extremi- 
ties, every man of sense and judgment among the Catholics, 
from the Pope to a porter, knew that the King was a mere 
bigoted fool, who would undo himself and the cause he 
sought to advance; but he was deaf to all reason, and, 
happily for England ever afterwards, went tumbling off his 
throne in his own blind way. 

A spirit began to arise in the country, which the besotted 
blunderer little expected. He first found it out in the 
University of Cambridge. Having made a Catholic, a dean , 
at Oxford, without any opposition, he tried to make a monk 
a master of arts at Cambridge : which attempt the Univer- 
sity resisted, and defeated him. He then went back to his 
favourite Oxford. On the death of the President of Mag* 
daleu College, he commanded that there should he elected 
to succeed him, one Mr, Anthony Farmer, whose only 
recommendation was, that he was of the King’s religion. 
The University plucked up courage at last, and refused. 
The King substituted another man, and it still refused, re- 
solving to stand by its own eleotion of a Mr. Hough. The 
dull tyrant, upon this, punished Mr. Hough, and five-and- 
twenty more, by causing them to be expelled and declared 
incapable of holding any church preferment; then he pro- 
ceeded to what he supposed to be his highest step, but to 
what was, in fact, his last plunge headforemost in his tum- 
ble off his throne. 

He had issued a declaration that there should be no relig- 
ious tests or penal laws, in order to let in the Catholics 
more easily ; but the Protestant dissenters, unmindful of 
themselves, had gallantly joined the regular church in op- 
posing it tooth and nail. The King and Father Petre now

resolved to have this read, on a certain Sunday, in all ttie 
churches, and to order it to be circulated for that purpose 1 
by the bishops. The latter took counsel with the Arch* 
bishop of Canterbury, who was in disgrace; and they re* 
solved that the declaration should not be* read, and that 
they would petition the King against it. The Archbishop 
himself wrote out the petition, and six bishops went into the 
King’s bed-chamber the same night to present it, to his in- 
finite astonishment. Next day was the Sunday fixed for 
the reading, and it was only read by two hundred clergy- 
men out of ten thousand. The King resolved against all 
advice to prosecute the bishops in the Court of King’s 
Bench, and within three weeks they were summoned before 
the Privy Council* and committed to the Tower. As the 
six bishops were taken to that dismal place, by water, the 
people who were assembled in immense numbers fell upon 
their knees, and wept for them, and prayed for them. 
When they got to the Tower, the officers arid soldiers on 
guard besought them for their blessing. While they were 
confined there, the soldiers every day drank to their release 
with loud shouts. When they were brought up to the 
Court of King’s Bench for their trial, which the Attorney- 
General said was for the high offence of censuring the Gov- 
ernment, and giving tliedr opinion abont affairs of state, 
they were attended by similar multitudes, and surrounded 
by a throng of noblemen and gentlemen. When the jury 1 
went out at seven o’clock at night to consider of their ver- 
dict, everybody (except the King) knew that they would 
rather starve than yield to the King’s brewer, who was one 
of them, and wanted a verdict for his customer. When 
they came into court next morning, after resisting the 
brewer all night, and gave a verdict of not guilty, such a 
shout rose up in Westminster Hall as it had never heard 
before ; and it was passed on among the people away to 
Temple Bar, and away again to the Tower. It did not pass 
only to the east, but passed to the west too, until it reached 
the camp at Hounslow, where the fifteen thousand soldiers 
took it up and echoed it. And still, when the dull King, 
who was then with Lord Feversham, heard the mighty roar, 
asked in alarm what it Was, and was told that it Was “ noth- 
ing but the acquittal of the bishops,” he said, in his dogged 
way, “ Call you that nothing? It is so much, the worse for 
them,”

Between the petition and the trial, the Queen had given 
birth to a, son, which Father Petre rather thought was ow- 
ing to Saint Winifred- But I doubt if Saint Winifred had 
much to do with it as the King’s friend, inasmuch as the 
entirely new prospect of a Catholic successor (for both the 
King’s daughters were Protestants) determined the Earls 
of Shrewsbury, Danby, and Devonshire, Lord Lumley, 
the Bishop of London, Admiral Bussell, and Colonel 
Sidney, to invite the Prince of Orange over to England. 
The Boyal Mole, seeing his danger at last, made, in his 
fright, many great concessions, besides raising an army of 
forty thousand men ; but the Prince of Orange was not a 
man for James the Second to cope with. His preparations 
were extraordinarily vigorous, and his mind was resolved. 

For a fortnight after the Prince was ready to sail for 
England, a great wind from the west prevented the depart- 
ure of his fleet. Even when the wind lulled, and it did 
sail, it was dispersed by a storm, and was obliged to put 
back to refit. At last, on the first of November, one thou- 
sand six hundred and eighty-eight, the Protestant east 
wind, as it was long called, began to blow ; and on the 
third, the people of Dover and the people of Calais saw a 
fleet twenty miles long sailing gallantly by, between the 
two places. On Monday, the fifth, it anchored at Torbay 
in Devonshire, and the Prince, with a splendid retinue of 
officers and men, marched into Exeter. But the people in 
that western part of the country had suffered so much 
in The Bloody Assize, that they had lost heart. Few 
people joined him ; and he began to think of returning, and 
publishing the invitation he had received from those lords, 
as his justification for having come at all. At this erisis, 
some of the gentry joined him ; the Boyal army began to 
falter; an engagement was signed, by which all who set 
their hand to it declared that they would support one an- 
other in defence of the laws and liberties of the three King- 
doms, of the Protestant religibn, and of the Prince of 
Orange. From that time, the cadse received no check ; the 
greatest towns in England began, one after another, to de- 
clare for the Prince; and he knew that it was all safe with 
him when the University of Oxford offered to melt down 
its plate, if he wanted any money. 

By this time the King was running about in a pitiable 
way, touching people for the King’s evil in one place, re*

viewing his troops in Another, and bleeding from the hose 
in a third. The young Prinoe was sent to Portsmouth, 
Father Petre went off like a shot to France, and there was 
a general and swift dispersal of all the priests and friars. 
One after another, the’ King’s most important officers and 
friends deserted him and went over to the Prinoe. In the 
night, his daughter Anne fled from Whitehall Palace ; and 
the Bishop of London, who had once been a soldier, rode 
before her With a drawn sword ih his hand, and pistols at 
his saddle. “God help me,” cried the miserable King: 
“ my very children have forsaken me! ” In his wildness, 
after debating with such lords as were in London, whether 
he should or should not .Call a Parliament, and after nam- 
ing three of them to negotiate with the Prince, he resolved 
to fly to France. He had the little Prince of Wales brought 
back from Portsmouth; and the child and the Queen 
crossed the river to Lambeth in an Open boat, on a miser- 
able wet night, and got safely away. This was on the night 
of the ninth of December. 

At one o’clock on the morning of the eleventh, the 
King, who had, in the meantime, received a letter from the 
Prince of OrangU, stating his objects, got out of bed, told 
Lord Northumberland who lay in his room not to open 
the door until the usual hour in the morning, and went 
down the back stairs (the same, I suppose, by which the 
priest in the wig and gown had come up to his brother) and 
crossed the river in a small boat: sinking the great seal of 
England by the way. Horses having been provided, he 
rode, accompanied by Sir Edward Hales, to Feversham, 
where he embarked in a Custom House Hoy. The master 
of this Hoy, wanting more ballast, ran into the Isle of 
SheppytO get it, where the fishermen and smugglers crowd* 
ed about the boat, and informed the King of their suspi- 
cions that he was a “ hatchet-faced Jesuit.” As they took 
his money and would not let him go, he told them 1 who he 
was, and that the Prince of Orange wanted to take his life ; 
and he began to scream for a boat — and' then to cry, be* 
cause he had lost a piece of wood on his ride which he 
called a fragment of Our Saviours cross. He put himself 
into the hands of the Lord Lieutenant of the county, and 
his detention was made known to the Prince of Orange at 
Windsor— who, only wanting to rid nf him, and not 
caring where he went, so P ^y, was very

much disconcerted that they did not let him go. However, 
there was nothing for it but to have him brought back, 
with some state in the way of Life Guards, to Whitehall. 
And as soon as he got there, in his infatuation, he heard 
mass, and set a Jesuit to say grace at his public dinner. 

The people had been thrown into the strangest state of 
confusion by bis flight, and had taken it into their heads 
that the Irish part of the army were going to murder the 
Protestants. Therefore, they set the bells a ringing, and 
lighted watch-fires, and burned Catholic Chapels, and looked 
about in all directions for Father Petre and the Jesuits, 
while the Pope’s ambassador was running away in the dress 
of a footman. They found nq Jesuits; but a man, who 
had once been a frightened witness before Jeffreys in 
court, saw a swollen drunken face looking through a win- 
dow down at Wapping, which he well remembered. The 
face was in a sailor’s dress, but he knew it to be the face 
of that accursed Judge, and he seized him. The people, 
to their lasting honour, did not tear him to pieces. After 
knocking him about a little, they took him, in the basest 
agonies of terror, to the Lord Mayor, who sent him, at his 
own shrieking petition, to the Tower for safety. There, he 
died. 

Their bewilderment continuing, the people now lighted 
bonfires and made rejoicings, as if they had any reason to 
be glad to have the King back again. But, his stay was 
very short, for the English guards were removed from 
Whitehall, Dutch guards were marched up to it, and he 
was told by one of his late ministers that the Prince would 
enter London next day, and he had better go to Ham. 
He said, Ham was a cold damp place, and he would rather 
go to Rochester. He thought himself very cunning in this, 
as he meant to escape from Rochester to France. The 
Prince of Orange and his friends knew that, perfectly well, 
and desired nothing more. Bo, he went to Gravesend, in 
his royal barge, attended by certain lords, and watched by 
Dutch troops, and pitied by the generous people, who were 
far more forgiving than he had ever been, when they saw 
him in his humiliation. On the night of the twenty-third 
of December, not even then understanding that everybody 
wanted to get rid of him, be went out, absurdly, through 
his Rochester garden, down to the Medway# and got away 
to France# where he rejoined the Queen.

Thei-e had been a council in his absence, of the lords, and 
the authorities of London. When the Prince came, on the 
day after the King’s departure, he summoned the lords to 
meet him, and soon afterwards, all those who had served 
in any of the Parliaments of King Charles the Second. It 
was finally resolved by these authorities that the throne 
was vacant by the conduct of King James the Second ; that 
it was inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Prot- 
estant kingdom, to be governed by a Popish prince ; that 
the Prince and Princess of Orange should ' be ting and 
Queen during their lives and the life of the survivor of 
them ; and that their children should succeed them, if they 
had any. That if they had none, the Prineess Anne ana 
her children should succeed; that if she had none, the 
heirs of the Prince of Orange should succeed. 

On the thirteenth of January, one thousand six hundred 
and eighty-nine, the Prince and Princess, sitting on a 
throne in Whitehall, bound themselves to these conditions. 
The Protestant religion was established in England, and 
England’s great and glorious Revolution was complete. 


CHAPTER XXXVII. 

I have now arrived at the close of my little history. 
The events which succeeded the famous lie volution of 
one thousand six hundred and eighty-eight, would neither 
be easily related nor easily understood in such a book as 
this. 

William and Mary reigned together, five years. After 
the death of his good wife, William occupied the throne, 
alone, for seven years longer. During his reign, on the 
sixteenth of September, one thousand Seven hundred and 
one, the poor weak creature who had once been James the 
Second of England, died in France. In the meantime he 
had done his utmost f which was not much) to cause Will- 
iam 1 0 lie assassinated, and to regain his lost dominions. 
James’s son was declared, by the French King, the right- 
ful King of England and waB called in France, Thu Citkv- 
alier Saint GtaokeK, and in England Thx Pretender.

Scotland, took up, the Pretender’s cause from time to time— 
as if the country had not had Stuarts enough ! — and many 
lives were sacrificed, and much misery was occasioned. 
King William died on Sunday, the seventh of Mareh s one 
thousand seven hundred and two, pf the consequences of an 
accident occasioned by his horse stumbling with him. He 
was always a brave patriotic Prince, and a man of remark- 
able, abilities. . His manner was cold, and he made but few 
friends but he had truly loyed his queen. When he was 
dead, a lock of her hair, in a ring, was found tied with 
a blank ribbon round his left arm. 

, He; was succeeded by the Princess Anne, a popular 
Queen,, who reigned twelve years. In her, reign, in the 
month of May, one thousand seven hundred and seven, the 
Union between England and Scotland was effected, and 
the two countries were incorporated under the name of 
Great Britain. Then, from the year one thousand seven 
hundred and fourteen to, the year one thousand eight hun- 
dred and thirty, reigned the four Georgjss. 

It was iu the reign of George the Second, one thousand 
seven hundred and forty-five, that the Pretender did his 
last mischief, and made his last appearance. Being an old 
man by that time, he and the Jacobites — as his friends 
were called — put forward his son, Charles Edward, 
known as the j Young Ghe? alier . TJhe; Highlanders of Scot- 
land, an extremely troublesome and wrong-headed race on 
tfie subject of the Stuarts, espoused his .cause, and he 
joined them, and there was a Scottish rebellion to make 
him king,, in, which many gallant and devoted gentlemen 
lost their lives. Jt was a hard matter, for Charles Edward 
to escape abroad again, with a high price on his head; but 
the Scottish people were extraordinarily faithful to him, 
and,, after undergoing many romantic adventures, not un- 
like those of .Charles the Second, he escaped to France. A 
number of charming stories and delightful songs arose out 
of the Jacobite feelings, and belong to the Jacobite times. 
Otherwise I think the Stuarts were a public nuisance alto- 
gether. 

It was in the reign of George the Third that England lost 
North America, by persisting in taxing her without her 
own consent. That immense country, made independent 
under Washington and left to itself, became the United 
States; one of the greatest nations pf the earth* : Jn these

times in which I write, it is honourably remarkable for 
protecting its subjects, wherever they may travel, with a 
dignity and a determination which is a model for England. 
Between you and me, England has rather lost ground in 
this respect since the days of Oliver Cromwell. 

The Union of Great Britain with Ireland — which had 
been getting on very ill by itself — took place in the reign 
of George the Third, on the second of July, one thousand 
seven hundred and ninety-eight. 

William the Fourth succeeded George the Fourth, 
in the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty, and 
reigned seven years. Queen Victoria, his niece, the only 
child of the Duke of Kent, the fourth son of George the 
Third, came to the throne on the twentieth of June, one 
thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven. She was mar- 
ried to Prince Albert of Saxe Gotha on the tenth of Feb- 
ruary, one thousand eight hundred and forty. She is very 
good, and much beloved. So I end, like the crier, with

NOTES ON A CHILD’S HISTORY OF 
ENGLAND. 


The late Miss Mamie Dickens has stated that she re- 
membered only one occasion on which her father em- 
ployed an amanuensis. Miss Georgina Hogarth then acted 
in that capacity, and to her the novelist dictated nearly 
the whole of the “ Child’s History of England.” At this 
time Dickens was excessively busy, being simultaneously 
engaged upon “ Bleak House” and the editing of “ House- 
hold Words.” Mias Hogarth remembers that he dictated 
the “ History” to her f< while walking about the room, as a 
relief after his long sedentary imprisonment.” 

“A Child’s History of England” was written primarily 
for publication as a ferial in “ Household Words,” the 
instalments covering a period of nearly three years. A 
portion was prepared and the work finally completed, 
at Boulogne during the latter year, as indicated by a letter 
written to Forster in September, 1853: “I finished the 
little History, yesterday, and am trying to think of 
something for the Christmas Number” [of “ Household 
Words ”]. Kitton tells us that the author availed himself of 
Keightley’s “ History of England” as the basis of his own 
book, as evidenced by a copy of that work containing marks 
and marginal notes in Dickens’s autograph. The “ History ” 
— a theme altogether outside his usual range of author- 
ship — was compiled with the view of bringing it down to 
the comprehension of youth ; this assertion is borne out by 
the Dedication: “To my own dear children, whom I hope 
it may help, by and by, to read with interest larger and 
better books on the same , subject” 

In 1853, when quite a youth, Mr. Marcus Stone, R.A., 
was the recipient of a copy of “ A Child’s History of Eng- 
land” as a present from the author, who in a note inti-

In a letter to Douglas Jerrold, May 3rd, 1843, Dickens 
said: “ I am writing a little history of England for my boy, 
which I will send you when it is printed for him, though 
your boys are too old to profit by it.” This allusion 
was made ten years prior to the production of “ A Child’s 
History of England,” and had reference to an altogether 
different work, which was never completed.

THE OVERTURE. 

Day of the month and year, November the thirtieth, one 
thousand eight hundred and thirty-five. London Time by 
the great elockof Saint Paul’s, ten at night. Ail the lesser 
London Churches strain their metallic throats. Some, flip** 
paiitly begin before the hfeavy bell of the great cathedral ; 
some, tardily begin three, four, half a dozen, stroked behind 
it; all are insufficiently near accord, to leave a. resonance 
in the air, as if the winged father who devonrs- his children, 
had made a sounding sweep with his gigantic scythe ini fly- 
ing over the city. 

What is this clock lower than most of the rest, and nearer 
to the ear, that lags so far behind to-night as to strike into 
the vibration alone? This is the dock of the Hospital for 
Foundling ChiMren. Time was, when the Foundlings were 
received without question in a cradle at the gate. Time is, 
when inquiries are made respecting them, and they are 
taken as by favour frorii the mothers who relinquish all 
natural knowledge of /them and claim to them for evermore. 

The moon is at the full, and the night is fair with light 
eloud&. The day has been otherwise than, fair, for slush 
and mud, thickened with the droppings of - heavy fog, lae 
black in the streets. The veiled lady who flutters up and 
down near the postcm-gate of the Hospital for Foundling 
Children has need to be well shod to-night. 1 

She flutters to and fro, avoiding the stand of hackney- 
coaches, and often pajusing in the shadow of the wefeteha 
end of the great quadrangle wall, with her face turned tow- 
ards the gate. As above her there is the purity of tfhe 
moonlit sky, and below her there are the defilements of the 
pavement, so may she, haply, be divided in her mind be- 
tween two vistas of reflection or experience? At her foot- 
prints crossing and reeroasing one another have made a 
labyrinth in the mh*e, so may her track in life have h*. 
volved itself in an intricate and unravellable tangle?

aside, observes closely, sees that the gate is quietly closed 
again from within, and follows the young woman. 

Two or three streets have been traversed in silence before 
she, following close behind the 6bject of her attention, 
stretches out her hand and touches her. Then the young 
woman stops and looks round, startled. 

“You touched me last night, and, when I turned my 
head, you would not speak. Why do you follow me like a 
silent ghost? ” 

“ It was not,” returned the lady, in a low voice, “that I 
would not speak, but that I could not when I tried.” 

“ What do you want of me? I have never done you any 
harm? ” 

“Never.” 

“ Do I know you? ” 

“No.” 

“ Then what can you want of me? ” 

“Here are two guineas in this paper. Take my poor lit- 
tle present, and I will tell you.” 

Into the young woman’s face, which is honest and comely, 
comes a flush as she replies : “ There is neither grown per- 
son nor child in all the large establishment that I belong to 
who hasn’t a good word for Sally. I am Sally. Gould I 
be so well thought of, if I was to be bought? ” 

“ I do not mean to buy you; I mean only to reward you 
very slightly.” 

Sally firmly, but not urgently, closes and puts back the 
offering hand. “ If there is anythingthat I can do for you, 
ma’am, that I will not do for its own sake, you are much 
mistaken in me if you think that I will do it for money. 
What is it you want? ” 

“ You are one of the nurses or attendants at Hie Hospi- 
tal; I saw you leave to-night and last night.” 

“Yes, lam. I am Sally.” 

“ There is a pleasant patience in your face which makes 
me believe that very young children would take readily to 
you.” 

“ God bless ’em ! So they do.” 

The lady lifts her veil, and shows a face no older than 
the nurse’s. A faoe far more refined and capable tha n 
hers, but wild and worn with sorrow. 

“ I am the miserable mother of a baby lately received 
under your care. I have a prayer to make to you;”

Instinctively respecting the confidence which has drawn 
aside the veil, Sally — whose ways are all ways of simplicity 
and spontaneity — replaces it, and begins to cry. 

“ You will listen to my prayer? ” the lady urges. “ You 
will not be deaf to the agonised entreaty of such a broken 
suppliant as I am? ” . 

“Oh, dear, dear, dear!” cries Sally. “What shall I 
say, or can I say ! Don’t talk of prayers. Prayers are tq 
be put up to the Good Father of All, and not to nurses and 
such. And there! I am only to hold my place for half a 
year longer, till another young woman can be trained up to 
it. I am going to be married. I shouldn’t have been out 
last night, and I shouldn’t have been out to-night, but that 
my Dick (he is the young man I am going to be married to) 
lies ill, and I help his mother and sister . to watch , him. 
Don’t take on so, don’t take on so!” . 

“0 good Sally, dear Sally,” moans the lady, catching air 
her dress entreatingly. “ As you are hopeful and I am 
hopeless; as a fair way in life is before you, which can 
never, never, be before me; as you can aspire to become a 
respected wife, and as you can aspire to become a proud 
mother; as you are a living, loving woman, and must die? 
for God’s sake hear my distracted petition ! ” 

“Deary, deary, deary me!” cries Sally, her desperation 
culminating in the pronoun, “what am I ever to do? And 
there ! See how you turn my own words back upon mew I 
tell you I am going to be married; on purpose to make it 
clearer to you that I am going to leave, and therefore 
couldn’t help you if I would, Poor Thing, and you make it 
seem to my own self as if I was cruel in going to be > main 
ried and not helping you. It ain’t kind. Now, is it kind . 
Poor Thing? ” 

“ Sally ! Hear me, my dear. My entreaty is for no help 
in the future. It applies to what is past. It is only to be 
told in two words.” • 

“There! This is worse and worse,” cries Sally, “sup- 
posing that I understand what two words you meanj” 

“You do understand. What are the names they have 
given my poor baby? I ask no more than that. « I have 
read of the customs of the place. He has been christened 
in the chapel, and registered by some surname in the book.

called him?” ■ i » . .]

Down upon her knees in the foul mud of the bye-way 
into which they have strayed— an empty street without a 
thoroughfare, giving on the dark gardens of the Hospital — 
the lady would drop in her passionate entreaty, but that 
Sally prevents her, 

“Don’t! Don’t! You make me feel as if I was setting 
myself up to be good. Let me look in your pretty face 
again. Put your two hands in mine. Now, promise. 
You will never ask me anything more than the two words? ” 

“Never! Never!” 

“ You will never put them to a bad use, if I say them! ” 

“Never! Never!” 

“ Walter Wilding.” 

The lady lays her face upon the nurse’s breast, draws 
her close in her embrace with both arms, murmurs a bless- 
ing and the words, “ Kiss him for me ! ” and is gone. 

Day of the month and year, the first Sunday in October, 
one thousand eight hundred and forty-seven. London 
Time by the great clock of Saint Paul’s, half-past one in 
the afternoon. The clock of the Hospital for Foundling 
Children is well up with the Cathedral to-day. Service in 
the chapel is over, and the Foundling Children are at dinner. 

There are numerous lookers-on at the dinner, as the cus- 
tom is. There are two or three governors, whole families 
from the congregation, smaller groups of both sexes, indi- 
vidual stragglers of various degrees. The bright autumnal 
sun strikes freshly into the wards; and the heavy-framed 
windows through which it shines, and the panelled walls 
on which it strikes, are such windows and such walls as 
pervade Hogarth’s pictures. The girls’ refectory (includ- 
ing that of the younger children) is the principal attraction. 
Neat attendants silently glide about the orderly and silent 
tables; the lookers-on move or stop as the fancy takes them; 
comments in whispers on face such a number from such a 
window are not unfreqnent; many of the faces are of a 
character to fix attention. Some of the visitors from the 
outside public are accustomed visitors. They have estalv 
li&hed a speaking acquaintance with the occupants of par- 
ticular seats at the tables, and halt at those points to bend 
down and say a word or two. It is no disparagement to 
their kindness that those points are generally points where 
personal attractions are. The monotony of long spacious

rooms and the double lines of faces is agreeably relieved by 
these incidents, although so slight. 

A veiled lady, who has no companion, goes among the 
company; It would seem that curiosity and opportunity 
have never brought her there before. She has the air of 
being a little troubled by the sight, and, as she goes the 
length of the tables, it is with a hesitating step and an un- 
easy manner. At length she comes to the refectory of the 
boys. They are so much less popular than the girls that it 
is bare of visitors when she looks in at the doorway* 

But just withki the doorway, chances to stand, inspect- 
ing, an elderly female attendant : some order of matron or 
housekeeper. To whom the lady addresses natural ques- 
tions: As, how many boys? At what age are they usually 
put out in life? Do they often take a fancy to the sea? 
So, lower and lower in tone until the lady puts the ques- 
tion : “ Which is Walter Wilding? ” 

Attendant’s head shaken* Against the rules; 

“ You know which is Walter Wilding? ” 

So keenly does the attendant feel the closeness with 
which the lady’s eyes examine her face, that she keeps her 
own eyes fast upon the floor, lest by wandering in the right 
direction they should betray her. 

“ I know which is Walter Wilding,. but it is not my place, 
ma’am, to tell names to visitors.” 

“ But you can show ine without telling me*” ! 

The lady’s hand moves quietly to the attendant’s hand. 

Pause and silence. 

“ I am going to pass round the tables,” says the lady’s 
interlocutor, without seeming to address her. “ Follow me 
with your eyes. The boy that I stop and speak to, will not 
matter to you. But the boy that I touch, will be Walter 
Wilding. Say nothing more to me, and move a little away. ” 

Quickly acting on the hint, the lady passes on into the 
room, and looks about her. After a few moments, the at- 
tendant, in a staid official way, walks down outside the line 
of tables commencing on her left hand. She goes the whole 
length of the line, turns, and comes baek on the inside. 
Very slightly glancing in the lady’s direction, she stoops, 
bends forward, and speaks. The boy whom she addresses, 
liftB his head and replies. Good humouredly and easily, as 
she listens to what he says* she lays hqr hand upon the 
shoulder of the next boy on his right. That the action

may be well noted, she keeps her hand on the shonldei 
while speaking in return, and pats it twice or thrice before 
moving away. She completes her tour of the tables, touch- 
ing no one else, and passes out by a door at the opposite end 
of the long room. 

Dinner is done, and the lady, too, walks down outside 
the line of tables commencing on her left hand, goes the 
whole length of the line, turns, and comes back on the in- 
side. Other people have strolled in, fortunately for her, 
and stand sprinkled about. She lifts her veil, and, stop- 
ping at the touched boy, asks how old he is? 

“I am twelve, ma’am,” he answers, with his bright eyes 
fixed on hers. 

“ Are you well and happy? ” 

“Yes, ma’am.” 

“ May you take these sweetmeats from my hand? ” 

“If you please to give them to me.” 

In stooping low for the purpose, the lady touches the 
boy’s face with her forehead and with her hair. Then, 
lowering her veil again, she passes on, and passes out with- 
out looking back. 


ACT I. 

THE CURTAIN RISES. 

In a courtyard in the City of London, which was No 
Thoroughfare either for vehicles or foot-passengers; a 
courtyard diverging from a steep, a slippery, and a winding 
street connecting Tower-street with the Middlesex shore of 
the Thanles; stood the place of business of Wilding and 
Co. Wine Merchants. Probably, as a jocose acknowledg- 
ment of the obstructive character of this main approach, 
the point nearest to its base at which one could take the 
river (if so inodorously minded) bore the appellation Break- 
Neck-Stairs. The courtyard itself had likewise been de- 
scriptively entitled in old time, Cripple Comer. 

Years before the year one thousand eight hundred and 
sixty-one, people had left off taking boat at Break-Neck- 
Stairs, and watermen had ceased to ply there. The slimy 
little causeway had dropped into the river by a slow proc- 
ess of suicide, and two or three stumps of piles and a rusty 
iron mooring-ring were all that remained of the departed 
Break-Neck glories. Sometimes, indeed, a laden coal

barge would bump itself into the place, and certain labori- 
ous heavers, seemingly mud-engendered, would arise, de- 
liver the cargo in the neighbourhood, shove off, and vanish; 
but at most times the only commerce of Break-Neck- Stairs 
arose out of the conveyance of casks and bottles, both full 
and empty, both to and from the cellars of Wilding and 
Co. Wine Merchants. Even that commerce- *was but occa- 
sional, and through three-fourths of its rising tides the 
dirty indecorous drab of a river would come solitarily ooz- 
ing and lapping at the rusty ring, as if it had heard of the 
Doge and the Adriatic, and wanted to be married to the 
great conserver of its filthiness, the Right Honourable the 
Lord Mayor. 

Some two hundred and fifty yards on the right, up the 
opposite hill (approaching it from the low ground of Break- 
Neck- Stairs) was Cripple Comer. There was a pump in 
Cripple Comer, there was a tree in Cripple Corner. All 
Cripple Comer belonged to Wilding and Co. Wine Mer- 
chants. Their cellars burrowed under it, their mansion 
towered over it. It really had been a mansion in the days 
when merchants inhabited the City, and had a ceremonious 
shelter to the doorway without visible support, like the 
sounding-board over an old pulpit. It had also a number 
of long narrow strips of window, so disposed in its grave 
brick front as to render it symmetrically ugly. It had 
also, on its roof, a cupola with a bell in it* 

“ When a man at five-and-twenty can put his hat on, and 
can say ‘ this hat covers the owner of this property and of 
the business which is transacted on this property , 9 I con- 
sider, Mr. Bintrey, that, without being boastful, he may be 
allowed to be deeply thankful. I don’t know how it may 
appear to you, but so it appears to me.” 

Thus Mr. Walter Wilding to his man of law, in his own 
counting-house; taking his hat down from its peg to suit 
the action to the word, and hanging it up again when he 
had done so, not to overstep the modesty* of nature. 

An innocent, open-speaking, tinused-looking man, Mr. 
Walter Wilding, with a remarkably pink and white com- 
plexion, and a figure much too bulky for so young a man, 
though of a good stature. With crispy curling brown hair, 
and amiable bright blue eyes. An extremely communica- 
tive man : a man with whom loquacity was the irrestrainable 
outpouring of contentment and gratitude. Mr. Bintrey, on

eyes in a large overhanging bald head, who inwardly but 
intensely enjoyed the comicality of openness of speech, or 
hand, or heart, 

“Yes,” said Mr. Bintrey. “Yes, Ha, ha!” 

A decanter, two wine-glasses, and a plate of biscuits, 
stood on the desk, 

“ You like this forty-five year old port wine? ” said Mr. 
Wilding. 

“ Like it? ” repeated Mr. Bintrey. “ Rather, air ! ” 

“ It's from the best oomer of our beat forty-five year old 
bin,” said Mr. Wilding, 

“Thank you, sir,” said Mr. Bintrey. “It’s most excel- 
lent.” 

He laughed again, as he held up his glass and ogled 
it, at the highly ludicrous idea of giving away such 
wine. 

“ And now,” said Wilding, with a childish enjoyment in 
the discussion of affairs, “ I think we have got everything 
straight, Mr. Bintrey.” 

“Everything straight,” said Bintrey. 

“ A partner secured— 

“Partner secured,” said Bintrey. 

“ A housekeeper advertised for- ” 

“Housekeeper advertised for,” said Bintrey, “ 4 apply

“ My late dear mother's affairs wound up« ” 

“ Wound up,” said Bintrey. 

“ And all charges paid.” 

“And all charges paid,” said Bintrey, with a chuckle: 
probably occasioned by the droll circumstance that they had 
been paid without a haggle. 

“The mention of my late dear mother,” Mr. Wilding 
continued, his eyes filling with tears and his pocket-hand- 
kerchief drying them, “unmans me still, Mr. Bintrey

Wilding sobbed and dried his eyes, without attempt at iCQBr 
©ealment, during these remarks. 

Mr. Btotrey enjoyed his comical port, and said, after 
rolling it in his mouth : “ I .know the stpry/ 1 

“My late dear mother, Mr. Bintrey,” pursued the wine- 
merchaut, “ had been deeply deceived, and bad cruelly 
suffered. But on that subject my late dear mother’s lips 
were for ever sealed. By whom deceived, or under, what 
circumstances, Heaven only knows. My late -dear mother 
never betrayed her betrayer.” 

“.She had mack up iier mind*” said Mr. Burtrey^ again 
turning his wine on his palate, “ and she .could hold her 
peace.” An amused twinkle in his eyes pretty plainly 
added — “A devilish deal bettor than r you ever will ! ” 

“ 4 Honour, ’ ” said Mr. Wilding, sobbing as he quoted 
from the Commandments,, “ 4 itby father and thy mother, 
that thy days may be long in the laud.’ When I was in 
the Foundling, Mr. Bintrey, I was at such a loss how to 
do it, tli at I apprehended my days would be short in .the 
land. But 1 afterwards caane to honour my mother .deeply, 
profoundly. And I honour and revere, her memory. For 
seven happy years, Mi*. Bintrey,” pursued Wilding, still 
with the same innocent catching in Ids breath, and the 
same unabashed tears* “did my excellent mother article me 
to my predecessors dn this business, Bebbleson Nephew. 
Her affectionate forethought likewise apprenticed me to the 
Vintners’ Company* and made me in time a Free Vintner*

“ So now, Mr. Bintrey,” pursued Wilding, putting away 
his pocket-handkerchief* and smoothing his eyelids with 
his finders, “ now that I can no longer show my love and 
honour for the dear parent to whom my heart was myste- 
riously turned by Nature when she first spoke to me, a 
strange lady, I sitting at Our Sunday dinner-table in the 
Foundling, I can at least show that I am not ashamed of 
having been a Foundling, and that I, who never knew a 
father 1 of my own, wish to be a father to all in my employ- 
ment. Therefore,” continued Wilding, becoming enthusi- 
astic in his loquacity, “therefore, I want a thoroughly 
good housekeeper to undertake this dwelling-house of 
Wilding and Co. Wine Merchants, Cripple Corner, so that 
I may restore in it some of the old relations betwixt em- 
ployer and employed! So that I may live in it oh the spot 
where my money is made ! So that I may daily sit at the 
head Of the table at which the people in my employment 
Oat together, and may eat of the same roast and boiled, and 
drink of the same beer! So that the people in my employ- 
ment may lodge under the same roof with me ! So that we 

may one and all -I beg your pardon, Mr. Bintrey, but 

that old singing in .my head has suddenly come on, and I 
shall feel obliged if you will lead me to the pump.” 

Alarmed by the excessive pinkness of his client, Mr. 
Bintrey lost not a moment in leading him forth into the 
courtyard. It was easily done, for the counting-house in 
which they talked together opened on to it, at one side ot 
the dwelling-house. There, the attorney pumped with a 
will, obedient to a sign from the client, and the client 
laved his head and face with both hands, and took a hearty 
drink. After these remedies, he declared himself much 
better: 

“Don’t let your good feelings excite you,” said Bintrey, 
as they returned to the counting-house, and Mr. Wilding 
dried himself on a jack-towel behind an inner door. 

“No, no. I won’t,” he returned, looking out of the 
towel. “I won’t. ' I have not been confused, have I? ” 

* “Not at all. Perfectly clear.” * 

“Where did I leave off, Mr. Bintrey?” 

“Well, you left off — but I wouldn’t excite myself, if I 
was you, by taking it up again just yet.”' 

“ I’ll take care. I’ll take Care. The singing in my head 
came on at where, Mr. Bintrey? ”

“ At roast, and boiled, and beer,” answered the lawyer, *

“ Ah ! And one and all singmg in the head together—” ' 
■ “Do you know I really would not let my good feelings,, 
excite me, if I was you,” hinted the lawyer again, anx- . 
iously. “Try some more pump.” 

“No occasion, no occasion. All right, Mr. Bintrey. 
And one and all forming a kind of family! You see, Mr* 
Bintrey, I was hot used in my childhood to thalt sort of 
individual existence which most individuals have led, more 
or less, in their childhood. After that time I became ab- 
sorbed ih my 1 late dear mother. Having lost her, I, find 
that I am more fit for being one Of a body than one by my-

“ It is not I who am all-importaht in the case* but, you*”, 
returned' Bintrey. “ Consequently, how it may appear to 
me, is of very small importance.”

“ Who learn them together? ” asked the lawyer, rather 
shortly. ' 

“Employer and employed.” ' 

“Ay, ay!” returned Bintrey, mollified; as if he had 
half expected the answer to be, Lawyer and client* 
“That’s another thing.” 

“Not another thing, Mr. Bintrey! The same thing; A

tion without delay, so that my new partner may find tt 
fdunded when he enters on his partnership.” 

“All good be with it!” exclaimed Bin trey, rising. 
“May it prosper! Is Joey Ladle to take a share in Han- 
del, Mozart, Haydn, Kent, Purcell, Doctor Arne, Greene, 
and Mendelssohn? ” 

“I hope so.” 

“ I wish them all well out of it,” returned Bintrey, with 
much heartiness. “Good-bye, sir.” 

They shook hands and parted. Then (first knocking 
with his knuckles for leave) entered to Mr. Wilding, from 
a door of communication between his private counting-house 
and that in which his clerks sat, the Head Cellarman of 
the cellars of Wilding and Co. Wine Merchants, and erst 
Head Cellarman of the cellars of Pebbleson Nephew. The 
Joey Ladle in question. A slow and ponderous man, of 
the drayman order of human architecture, dressed in a cor- 
rugated suit and bibbed apron, apparently a composite of 
door-mat and rhinoceros-hide. 

“Respecting this same boarding and lodging, Young 
Master Wilding,” said he. 

“Yes, Joey?” 

“Speaking for myself, Young Master Wilding — and I 
npver did speak and I never do speak for no one else — 
I don’t want no boarding nor yet no lodging. But if you 
wish to board me and to lodge me, take me. I can peck 
as well as most men. Where I peck, ain’t so high a object 
with me as What I peck. Nor even so high a object with 
me as How Much I peck. Is all to live in the house, 
Young Master Wilding? The two other cellarmen, the 
three porters, the two ’prentices, and the odd men? ” 

“Yes. I hope we shall all be an united family, Joey.” 

“ Ah ! ” said Joey. “ I hope they may be.” 

“They? Rather say we, Joey.” 

Joey Ladle shook his head. “ Don’t look to me to make 
we on it, Youn^ Master Wilding, not at my time of life 
and under the circumstances which has formed my dispo- 
sition; I have said to Pebbleson Nephew many a time, 
when they have said to me, ‘ Put a livelier face upon it.

accustomed to take my wine in at the pores of the skip, and, 
took that away, it acts different. It acts depressing It’s 
one thing, gentlemen,’ I says to Pebbleson Nephew, ‘to 
charge your glasses in a dining-room with a Hip, Hurrah 
and a Jolly Companions Every One, and it’s another thing 
to be charged yourself, through the pores, in a low dark 
cellar and a mouldy atmosphere. It makes all the differ- 
ence betwixt bubbles and wapours, ’ I tells Pebbleson 
Nephew. And so it do. I’ve been a cellar man my life 
through, with my mind fully given to the business. 
What’ 8 the consequence? I’m as muddled a man as lives

won’t find my equal in molloacolly. Sing of Filling the 
bumper fair, Every drop you sprinkle, O’er the brow of 
care, Smooths away a wrinkle? Yes. P’raps so. But 
try filling yourself through the pores, underground, when 
you don’t want to it 1 ” 

“ I am sorry to hear this, Joey. I had even thought 
that you might join a singing-class in the house.” 

“Me, sir? No, no, Young Master Wilding, you won’t 
catch Joey Ladle middling the Armony. A pecking- 
machine, sir, is all that I am capable of proving myself, 
out of my cellars; but that you’re welcome to, if you think 
it’s worth your while to keep such a thing on your prem- 
ises.” 

“Ido, Joey.” 

“ Say no more, sir. The Business’s word is my law. 
And you’re a going to take Young Master George Vendale 
partner into the old Business? ” 

“lam, Joey.” 

“ More changes, you see ! But don’t change the name of 
the Firm again. Don’t do it, Young Master Wilding. It 
was bad luck enough to make it Yourself and Co. Better 
by far have left it Pebbleson Nephew that good luck always 
stuck to. You should never change luck when it’s gopd, 
sir.” 

“At all events, I have no intention of changing the 
name of the House again, Joey.” 

“ Glad to hear it, and wish you good day, Young Master 
Wilding. But you had better by half,” muttered Joey 
Ladle, inaudibly, as he closed tike door and shook his 
head, “have let the name alone from the first. You had 
better by half have followed the luck instead of .crossing it. ”

ENTER THE HOUSEKEEPER* 

The wine-merchant sat in his dining-room next morning, 
to receive the personal applicants for the vacant post in his 
establishment. It was an old-fashioned wainscoted room.; 
the panels ornamented with festoons of flowers carved in 
wood; with an oaken floor, a Well-worn Turkey carpet, and 
dark mahogany furniture, all of which had seen service and 
polish under Pebbleson Nephew. The great sideboard had 
Assisted at many business-dinners given by Pebbleson 
NepheW to their connection, on the principle of throwing 
sprats overboard to catch whales; and Pebbleson Nephew’s 
comprehensive three-sided plate-warmer, made to fit the 
whole front of the large fire-place, kept watch beneath it 
over a sarcophagus- shaped cellaret that had in its time held 
many a dozen of Pebbleson Nephew’s wine. But the little 
rubicund old bachelor with a pigtail, whose portrait was 
over the sideboard (and who Could easily be identified as 
decidedly Pebbleson and decidedly net Nephew), had re- 
tired into another sarcophagus, and the plate- warmer had 
growri as cold as he. So, the golden and black griffins 
that supported the candelabra, with black balls in their 
mouths at the end of gilded chains; looked as if in their old 
age they had lost all heart for playing at ball, and were 
dolefully exhibiting their chains in the missionary line of 
inquiry; whether they had hot earned emancipation by this 
time, and were not griffins and brothers?’ 

Such a Columbus of a morning was the summer morning, 
that it discovered Cripple Corner. The light and warmth 
pierced iti at the open windows 1 , and' irradiated the picture 
of a lady hanging over the chimney-piece, the only other 
decoration of the walls. ' 

“My mother at fitte-and- twenty,” said Mr. Wilding to 
himself, as his eyes enthusiastically followed the light to 
the portrait’s face, “ I hang up here, in order that visitors 
may admire my mother in the bloom of her youth and 
beauty. My mother at fifty I haftg in the seclusion of my 
own chamber, as a remembrance shored 1 to me. Oh ! It’s 
you, Jarvis!” 

These latter words he addressed to a clerk who had 
tapped at the door, and now looked in. 

“ Yes, sir. I merely wish to mention that it’s g6ne ten,

sir, and that* there are several females in the Counting- 
House.” i ’ 

“Dear me!” said the wine-merchant, deepening in the 
pink >o£ his complexion and whitening in the white, “are 
there several? So many as several? I had better begin 
before there are more. I’ll see them one by one, Jaxvjs, 
in the order of- their arrival.” . 

Hastily ehttenbhing himself in his easy-chafr at the table 
behind a great inkstand, , having first placed a chair on the 
other side of the table opposite his own seat, Mr. Wilding 
entered on his task; with considerable trepidation. 

He ran the gauntlet that must he run on any such ocean 
sion. There were the usual species of profoundly, unsym- 
pathetic women, and the usual species of much too sympa- 
thetic women. There were the buccaneering widows who 
came to seize him, and who griped umbrellas under their 
arms, as if each umbrella were be, and, each griper had got 
him. There were towering maiden ladies who had seen 
better days, and who came armed with clerical testimonials, 
to their theology, as if he were Saint Peter with his- keys* 
There were gentle maiden ladies who came to marry him, 
Thelre were ' professional ; housekeepers, like npnroammis- 
sioned officers, who put him through his domestic exercise,, 
instead of submitting themselves to catechism. There 
were languid invalids to whom salary 1 was not so much an 
object a£ the comforts of a private hospital. There were 
sensitive creatures who burst into tears on being addressed,, 
and had to be restored with glasses of cold water. There 
were some respondents who came two together, a highly 
promising one 'and a wholly unpromising one : of whom the 
promising one answered all questions charmingly, until it 
would at last appear that she was not a candidate at all, 
but only the friend of the unpromising one, who had glp ve- 
ered in absolute silence and apparent injury. 

At last, when the good wine-merchant’s simple heart was 
failing him, thfere entered an applicant quite different from 
all the rest. A woman, perhaps fifty, but looking younger, 
with a face remarkable for placid cheerfulness, and a man 4 
ner no less remarkable for its quiet expression of equability 
of temper. Nothing in het dress could have been changed

words, “My name is Sarah Goldstraw. Mrs, Goldstraw.

Half a dozen questions had scarcely extracted as much 
to the purpose from any one else. The voice dwelt so 
agreeably on Mr. Wilding’s ear as he made bis note, that 
he was rather long about iti When he looked up again, 
Mrs. Goldstraw’s glance had naturally gene round the

and to answer straight.

“Oh, surely, sir. Or I should have no business here.*

“Only once. I have lived with the same widow lady for 
twelve years. Ever since I lost my husband. She was an

“I do not doubt that she has left you the best creden-

. “ You Singularly remind me, Mrs. Goldstraw,* said 
Wilding, taking the card beside him, “of a manner and 
tone of voiee that I was once acquainted with. Not of an 
individual— I feel sure of that, though I cannot recall what 
it is I have iti my mind — but of a general bearing. I ought 
to add^ it was a kind and pleasant one.* 

She smiled, as she rejoined : “ At least, I am very glad 
of that, sir.* 

“ Yes,* said the wine-merchant, thoughtfully repeating 
his last phrase, with a momentary glance at his future 
housekeeper, “ it was a kind and pleasant one. But that 
is the most I can make of it. Memory is sometimes like a 
half-forgotten dream. I don’t know how it may appear to 
you, Mrs. Goldstraw, but so it appears to me.* 

Probably it appeared to Mrs. Goldstraw in a similar 
light,, for she quietly assented to the proposition. Mr.

Wilding then offered to put himself at once in Communica- 
tion with the gentlemen named upon the card a firm, of 
proctors fn Doctors’ Commons. To« this, Mrs. Gold straw 
thankfully assented. Doctors’ Commons not being far off, 
Mr. Wilding suggested the feasibility of Mrs. Goldstraw’ a 
lookings in again, say in three hours’ time. Mrsv Gold* 
straw readily undertook to do so. In fine, the result of 
Mr. Wilding’s inquiries being eminently satisfactory, Mrs. 
Goldstraw was that afternoon engaged fon her own per- 
fectly fair terms) to eome to-morrow ana set up her rest 
as housekeeper in Cripple Comer. 

THE 0 QU8EKEEPEU SPEAKS, 

On the next day Mm Goldstraw arrived, to enter on her 
domestic duties. 

Having settled herself in her own room, without trou- 
bling the servants, and without lasting time, the new house- 
keeper announced herself as waiting to be favoured with 
any instructions which her master might wish to give her. 
The wine-merchant received Mrs. Goldstraw in the dining-, 
room, in which he had seen her on the previous day; ahd, 
the usual preliminary civilities having passed on either 
side, the two sat down to take counsel together on the 
affaire of the house. 

“ About the meals, sir? ” said Mrs. Goldstraw. (i Have 
I a large, or a small, number to provide for? ” 

“ If I can carry out a certain old-fashioned plan of mine,” 
replied Mr. Wilding/ “you will have a large number to 
provide for. I am a lonely single man, Mrs. Goldstraw; 
and I hope to live with all the persons in my employment 
as if they were members of my family. Until that time 
comes, you will only have me, and the new partner whom 
I expect immediately, to provide for. What my partner’s 
habits may be, I cannot yet say. But I may describe my- 
self as a man of Tegular hours, with an invariable appetite 
that you may depend upon to an ounce.” 

“About breakfast, sir?” asked Mrs. Goldstraw. “Is 
there anything particular ? ” 

She hesitated, and left the sentenoe unfinished. Her 
eyes turned slowly away from her master, and looked tow- 
ards the chimney-piece. If she had been a less excellent 
and experienced housekeeper, Mr. Wilding might hav$

fancied that her attention was beginning to wander at the 
very outset of the interview. 

“ Eight o’clock is my breakfast-hour, ” he resumed. “ It 
is one of my virtues to be never tired of broiled bacon, and 
it is one of my vices to be habitually suspicious of the fresh- 
ness of eggs.” Mrs. Goldstraw looked back at him, still a 
little divided between her master’s chimney-piece and her 
master. “I take tea,” Mr. Wilding went on; “ and I am 
perhaps rather nervous and fidgety about drinking it, within 
a certain time, after it is made. If my tea stands too 
long " v 

He hesitated, on his side, and left the sentence unfin- 
ished. If he had not been engaged in discussing a subject 
of such paramount interest to himself as his breakfast, Mrs. 
Goldstraw might have fancied that his: attention was begin- 
ning to wander at the very outset of the interview. 

“ If your tea stands too long, sir — ~r? ” said the house- 
keeper, politely taking up her master's lost thread. 

“If my tea stands too long, "repeated the wine-merchant, 
mechanically, his mind getting further and further away 
from his. breakfast, and his eyes fixing themselves more 
and more inquiringly on his housekeeper’s face- “If my 
tea Dear, dear me, Mrs. Goldstraw l what trthe man- 

ner and tone of voice that ypu remind me of? It strikes 
me even more strongly to-day, than it did when I saw you 
yesterday. What can it be? ” 

“ What can it be? ” repeated Mrs. Goldstraw. 

She said the words, evidently thinking while she spoke 
them of something else. The wine-merchant, still looking 
at her inquiringly, observed that her eyes wandered towards 
the chimney-piece once more. They fitted pu the portrait 
of his mother, which hung there, and looked at it with that 
slight contraction of the brow which accompanies a scarcely 
conscious effort of memory. Mr. Wilding remarked : 

“My late dear mother, when she wa$ fi vp-and-twenty . ” 

Mrs* Goldstraw thanked him with a movement of the 
head for being at the pains to explain the picture, and said, 
with a cleared brow, that it was the portrait of a very beau- 
tiful lady. 

Mr. Wilding, . falling back into, his former perplexity, 
tried once more to recover that . lost recollection, associated 
so closely, and yet so undiscoverably, with his new house, 
keeper's voice and manner. t

“ Excuse my asking you a question which has nothing to 
do with me or my breakfast,” he said. “ May I inquire if 
you have ever occupied any other situation than the situ- 
ation of housekeeper? ” : r : , 

“Oh yes, sir. I began life as : one of the nurses at the 
Foundling.” 

“Why, that’s it!” cried the wiriC^merchant, pushing 
back his chair. “ By Heaven ! Their manner is the man- 
ner you remind me of ! ” 

In an astonished look at him, Mrs. Goldstraw changed 
colour, checked herself, turned her . eyes Upon the ground, 
and sat still and silent. 

“ What is the matter? ” asked Mr. Wilding. 

“ Do I understand that you were in the Foundling, sir? ” 

“ Certainly. I am not ashamed to own it.” 

“ Under the name you now bear? ” 

“Under the name of Walter Wilding.” 

“ And the lady — — ? ” Mrs. Goldstraw stopped short, 
with a look at the portrait which was now unmistakably a 
look of alarm. 

“ You mean my mother,” interrupted Mr. Wilding. 

f( Your— mother,” repeated the housekeeper, a little con- 
strainedly, “removed you from the Foundling? At what 
age, sir?” 

“ At between eleven and twelve years old. Itfs quite & 
romantic adventure, Mrs. Goldstraw.” 

He told the story of the lady having spoken to him, while 
he sat at dinner with the other boys in the Foundling, and 
of all that had followed, in his* innocently communicative 
way. “ My poor mother could nevei; have discovered me,” 
he added, “if she had not met with one of the matrons 
who pitied her. The matron consented to touch the boy 
whose name was 1 Walter Wilding ’ as she went round the 
dinner-tables — and so my mother discovered me again, 
after having parted from me as an infant at the Foundling 
doors.” 

At those words Mrs. Goldstraw’ s hand, resting on the 
table, dropped helplessly into her lap. She sat, looking at 
her new master, with a face that had turned deadly pale, 
and with eyes that expressed an unutterable dismay. 

“What does this mean?” asked the wine-merchant. 
“ Stop ! ” he cried. “ Is there something else in the past 
time which I ought to associate with you? I remember,

to whose kindness she owed a debt of gratitude. When 
she first parted with me, as an infant, one of the nurses in* 
formed her of the name that had been given to me in the 
institution. You were that nurse? ” 

“ God forgive me, sir — I was that nurse ! ” 

“God forgive you ? 99 

“We had better get back, sir (if I may make so bold as 
to say so), to my duties in the house," said Mrs. Gold- 
straw. “ Your breakfast-hour is eight. Do you lunch, or 
dine, in the middle of the day ? 99 

• The excessive pinkness which Mr. Bintrey had noticed 
in his client's face began to appear there once more. Mr. 
Wilding put his hand to his head, and mastered some mo- 
mentary confusion in that quarter, before he spoke again. 

“Mrs. Golds traw,” he said, “you are concealing some- 
thing from me ! 99 

The housekeeper obstinately repeated, “ Please to favour 
me, sir, by saying whether you lunch, or dine, in the mid- 
dle of the day ? 99 

“I don't know what I do in the middle of the day. I 
can’t enter into my household affairs, Mrs. Goldstraw, till 
I know why you regret an act of kindness to my mother, 
which she always spoke of gratefully to the end of her life. 
You are not doing me a service by your silence. You are 
agitating me, you are alarming me, you are bringing on the 
singing in my head." 

His hand went up to his head again, and the pink in his 
face deepened by a shade or two. 

“Its hard, sir, an just entering your service," said the 
housekeeper, ^ to say what may oost me the loss of your 
good will. Please to remember, end how it may, that I

there came to our institution in the country another lady (a 
stranger), whose object was to adopt one of our children. 
She brought the needful permission with her, and after

looking at a great many of the children, without being able 
to make up her mind, she took a sudden fancy to one of the 
babies — a boy — under my care. Try, pray try, to compose 
yourself, sir! It’s no use disguising it any longer* The 
child the stranger took away was the child of that lady 
whose portrait hangs there ! " 

Mr. Wilding started to his feet. “ Impossible ! ” he cried 
out, vehemently. “ What are you talking about? What 
absurd story are you telling me now? There’s her por- 
trait I Haven’t I told you so already? The portrait of my 
mother ! " 

“ When that unhappy lady removed you from the Found- 
ling in after years," said Mrs* Goldstraw, gently* “she was 
the victim, and you were the victim, sir, of a dreadful mis- 
take." 

He dropped hack into his chair. “ The room goes round' 
with me," he said. “My head! my head!" The house- 
keeper rose in alarm, and opened the windows. Before she 
could get to the door to call for help, a sudden burst of tears 
relieved the oppression which had at first almost appeared 
to threaten his life. He signed entreatingly to Mrs. Gold- 
straw not to leave him. She waited nntil the paroxysm of 
weeping had worn itfeelf out. He raised his head as he re-> 
covered himself, and looked at her with the angry unrea- 
soning suspicion of a weak man. ’ 

“Mistake?" he said, wildly repeating her last words. 
“ How do I know you are not mistaken yourself? " 

“There is no hope that I am mistaken, sir.. I will tell 
you why, when you are better fit to hear it." 

“Now! now!" 

The tone in which he spoke warned Mrs. Goldstraw that 
it would be cruel kindness to let him comfort himself a mo- 
ment longer with the vain hope that she might be wrong.: 
A few words more would end it-^and those few words she 
determined to 1 speak. 

“ I have told you," she said, “ that the child of the lady 
whose portrait hangs there, was adopted in its infancy, and 
taken away by a stranger. I am as certain of what I say 
as that I am now sitting here, obliged to distress you, sir, 
sorely against my will. Please to carry your mind on, 
now, to about three months after that time. I Was then at

that day about naming an infant — a boy — who had just 
been received. We generally named them out of the Di- 
rectory. On this occasion, one of the gentlemen who man- 
aged the Hospital happened to be looking over the Regis- 
ter. He noticed that the name of the baby who had been 
adopted (‘Walter Wilding ’) Was scratched out — for the 
reason, of course, that the child had been removed for good 
from our care. ‘ Here’s a name to let,’ he said. ‘ Give it 
to the new foundling who has been received to-day. \ The 
name was given, and the child was christened. You, sir, 
were that child.” 

The wine-merchant’s head dropped on his breast. “I 
was that child! ” he said to himself, trying helplessly to fix 
the idea in his mind. “ I was that child l” < , 

“Not very long after you had been received into the In- 
stitution, sir,” pursued Mrs. Goldstraw, “I left my situ- 
ation there, to be married. If you will remember that, 
and if you can give your mind to it, you will see for your- 
self how the mistake happened. Between eleven and 
twelve years passed before the lady, whom you have be- 
lieved to be your mother, -returned to the Foundling, to 
find her son, and to remove him to her own home. The 
lady only knew that her infant had been called ‘ Walter 
Wilding.’ The matron who took pity on her, could but 
point out the only ‘ Walter Wilding ’ known in the Institu- 
tion. I, who might have set the matter right, was far 
away from the Foundling and all that belonged to it. 
There was nothing — there was really nothing that could 
prevent this terrible mistake from taking place. . I feel for 
you — I do indeed, sir ! You must think— and with reason 
— that it w&s in an fevil hour that I came < here (innocently 
enough, I’m sure), to apply for your housekeeper’s place. 
I feel as if I was to blame — J feel as if I ought to have had 
more self-command. If I had only been able to keep my 
face from showing you, what that portrait and what your 
own ) wbrds put into iny mind — you need never, to your 
dying day, have known what you know now.” 

Mr. Wilding looked up suddenly. The inbred honesty 
of the man rose in protest against the housekeeper’s last 
words. His mind seemed to steady itself , for the moment, 
under the shock that had fallen on it. 

“ Do you mean to say that you would have concealed this 
from me if you could? ” he exclaimed. n *

' a I hope I should always tell' the truth, sir*, if I Wad 
asked,” said Mrs. Goldstraw. “And I know it is' betted

“ I beg your pardon,” said the wine-merchant. *“ You 
must make allowance for me. * This dreadful discovery is 
something I can’t realise even yet. We loved each other 
so dearly— I felt so fondly that I was her son. She died, 
Mrs. Goldstraw, in my arms — she died blessing me as only 
a mother could have blessed me. And now, after all these 
years, to be told she was not my mother! O me, 0 me! I 
don’t know what I am saying ! ; ’ he cried, as the impulse 
of self-control under which he had spoken a moment since, 
flickered, and died out. “ It was not this dreadful grief — 
it was something else that I had it in my mind to speak of . 
Yes, yes. You surprised — you wounded me just now. 
You talked as if yOu would have hidden this from me, if 
you could. Don’t talk in that way again. It would have 
been a crime to have hidden it. You mean well; I' know. 
I don’t want to distress you— you are a kind-hearted woman. 
But you don’t remember what my position is. She left me 
all that I possess, in the firm persuasion that I was her son. 
I am not her son. I have taken the place, I have innocently 
got the inheritance of another man. He must be found ! 
How do I know he is not at'this moment in misery, with-

this — I am going to take him to Switzerland..* ” 

To Switzerland? What part of Switzerland? ” 

“ She didn’t say, sir.” 

“Only that faint clue!” said Mr. Wilding. “And a 
quarter of a century has passed since the child was taken 
away ! What am I to do? ” 

“ I hope you won’t take offence at my freedom, sir,” said 
Mrs. Goldstraw; “hut why should you distress yourself 
about what is to be done? He may not be alive now, for 
anything* you know. And, if he, is alive, it’s not likely he 
can be in any distress. The lady who adopted him was 
a bred and bora lady — it was easy to see that. And she 
must have satisfied them at the Foundling that she could 
provide for the child, or they would never have let her take 
him away. If I was in your place, sir — please to excuse 
my saying so— I should comfort myself with remembering 
that I had loved that poor lady whose portrait you have got 
there — truly loved her an any mother, and that she Itad 
truly loved me as her son. All she gave to you, she gave 
for the sake of that love. It never altered while she lived; 
and it won’t alter, I’m sure, as long as you live. How can you 
have a better right, sir, to keep what you have got than that?” 

Mr. Wilding’s immovable honesty saw the fallacy in his 
housekeeper’s point of view at a glance. 

“You don’t understand me,” he said. “It’s because I 
loved her that I feel it a duty — a sacred duty — to do justice 
to her son. If he is a living man, I must find him : for my 
own sake> as well as for his. 1 shall break down under this 
dreadful trial, unlesB I employ myself — actively, instantly 
employ myself— in doing what my conscience tells me ought 
to be done. I must speak to my lawyer; I must set my 
lawyer at work before I sleep to-night.” He approached a 
tube in the wall of the room, and called down through it to 
the office below. “Leave me for a. little, Mrs. Goldstraw,” 
be resumed; “I shall be more composed, I shall be better 
able to speak to you later in the day. We shall get on 
well — I hope we shall get on well together — in spite of 
what has happened. It isn’t your fault; I know it isn’t 
your fault. There! theye! shake handstand — and do the 
best you can in the house — I can’t talk about it now.” 

The door opened as Mrs. Goldstraw advanced ^ towards it;

“Bend for Mr. Bintrey,* said the wine-merchant ¥ Say 
I want to see him directly.” 

The clerk unconsciously suspended the execution of the 
order, by announcing “ Mr, Vendale,” and showing in the 
new partner in the firm of Wilding and Co. 

“ Pray excuse me for one moment, George Vendale,” said 
Wilding. “ I have a word to say to Jarvis. Send for Mr. 
Bin trey,” he repeated— “ send at once.” 

Mr. Jarvis laid a letter on the table before he left the 
room. 

“ From our correspondents at NeucMtel, I think, sir. 
The letter has got the Swiss postmark.” 

NEW CHABACTERS ON THE SCENE. 

The words, “The Swiss Postmark,” following so soon 
upon the housekeeper’s reference to Switzerland, wrought 
Mr. Wilding’s agitation to such a remarkable height, that 
his new partner could not decently make a pretence of let* 
ting it pass unnoticed. 

“Wilding,” he asked hurriedly, and yet stopping short 
and glancing around as if for some visible cause of his state 
of mind : what is .the matter? ” 

“ My good George Vendale,” returned the wine-merchant, 
giving his hand with an appealing look, rather as if he 
wanted help to get over some obstacle, than as if he gave 
it in welcome or salutation: “my good George Vendale, so 
much is the matter, that I shall never be myself again. It 
is impossible that I can ever be myself again. For, in fact, 
I am not myself.” 

The new partner, a brown-cheeked handsome fellow, of 
about his own age, with a quick determined eye and an im- 
pulsive manner, retorted with natural astonishment: “Not 
yourself ? ” 

“Not what I supposed myself to be,” said Wilding, 

“ What, in the name of wonder, did you suppose yourself 
t» be that you are not? ” was the rejoinder, delivered with 
a cheerful frankness, inviting confidence from a more reti- 
cent man, “ I may ask without impertinence, now that we 
are partners.” 

“ There again ! ” cried Wilding, leaning back in his chair, 
with a lost Took at the other, “ Partners ! I had no right 
to come into this business. It was never meant for me.

My mother never meant it should be mine. I mean, his 
mother meant it should be his — if I mean anything — or if 
I am anybody.” 

^Come, come,” urged his partner, after a moment’s 
pause, and taking possession of him with that calm confi- 
dence which inspires a strong nature when it honestly de- 
sires to aid a weak one. “ Whatever has gone wrong, has 
gone wrong through no fault of yours, I am very sure. I 
was not in this counting-house with you under the old re- 
gime, for three years, to doubt you, Wilding. We were 
not younger men than we are, together, for that. Let me 
begin our partnership by being a serviceable partner, and 
setting right whatever is wrong. Has that letter anything 
to do with it? ” 

“Hah!” said Wilding, with his hand to his temple. 
“There again! My head! I was forgetting the coinci- 
dence. The Swiss postmark.” 

“At a second glance I see that the letter is unopened, so 
it is not very likely to have much to do with the matter,” 
said Yendale, with comforting composure. “ Is it for you, 
or for us? ” 

“For us,” said Wilding. 

“ Suppose I open it and read it aloud, to get it out of our 
way? ” 

“Thank you, thank you.” 

“The letter is only from our champagne-making friends, 
the House at NeucMtel. 6 Hear Sir. We are in receipt of 
yours of the 28th nit., informing us that you have taken 
your Mr. Vendale into partnership, whereon we beg you to 
receive the assurance of our felicitations. Permit us to 
embrace the occasion of specially commending to you, M. 
J ules Obenreizer . ’ Impossible ! ” 

Wilding k>oked up in quick apprehension, and cried, 
“Eh?” 

“ Impossible sort of name,” returned his partner, slightly 
— “Obenreizer. i — Of specially commending to you M. 
Jules Obenreizer, of Soho-square, London (north side),

said Vendale, in a somewhat superfluously lucid manner.

reizer. To be sure! Possible sort of name, after all! 
* M. Obenreizer is in possession of our absolute confidence, 
and we do not doubt you will esteem Ms merits.* Duly 
signed by the House, * Defresnier et C le .* Very well. I 
undertake to see M. Obenreizer presently, and clear him 
out of the way. That clears the Swiss postmark out of the 
way. So now, my dear Wilding, tell me what I can clear 
out of your way, and I’ll find a way to clear it.” 

More than ready and grateful to be thus taken charge of, 
the honest wine-merchant wrung his partner’s hand, and, 
beginning his tale by pathetically declaring himself an 
Impostor, told it. 

“ It was on this matter, no doubt, that you were sending 
for Bintrey, when I came in ? 99 said Ms partner, after re- 
flecting. 

“It was.” 

“He has experience and a shrewd head; I shall be anx- 
ious to know his opinion. It is bold and hazardous in ‘mb 
to give you mine before I know his, but I am not good at 
holding back. Plainly, then, I do not see these circum- 
stances as you see them. I do not see your position as you 
see it. As to your being an Impostor, my dear Wilding, 
that is simply absurd, because no man can be that without 
being a consenting party to an imposition. Clearly you 
never were so. As to your enrichment by the lady who 
believed you to be her son, and whom you were forced to 
believe, on her own showing, to be your mother, consider 
whether that did not arise out of the personal relations be- 
tween you. You gradually became much attached to her; 
she gradually became much attached to you. It was on 
you, personally you, as I see the case, that she conferred 
these worldly advantages; it was from her, personally her, 
that you took them.” 

“She supposed me,” objected Wilding, shaking his head, 
“to have a natural claim upon her, wMch I had not.”

“I must admit that,” replied his partner, “to be true. 
But if she had made the discovery that you have made, six 
months before she died, do you think it would have can- 
celled the years you were together, and the tenderness that 
each of you had conceived for the other, each on increasing 
knowledge of the other? ” 

“What I think,” said Wilding, simply but stoutly hold- 
ing to the bare fact, “ can no more change the truth than it 
can bring down the sky. The truth is that I stand pos- 
sessed of what was meant for another man.” 

“He may be dead,” said Yendale. 

“ He may be alive,” said Wilding. “ And if he is alive, 
have I not — innocently, I grant you innocently — robbed him 
of enough? Have I not robbed him of all the happy time 
that I enjoyed in his stead? Have I not robbed him of the 
exquisite delight that filled my soul when that dear lady, ” 
stretching his hand towards the picture, “ told me she was 
my mother? Have I not robbed him of all the care she 
lavished on me? Have I not even robbed him of all the 
devotion and duty that I so proudly gave to her? There- 
fore it is that I ask myself, George Yendale, and I ask you, 
where is he? What has become of him? ” 

“Who can tell!” 

“I must try to find out who can tell. I must institute 
inquiries. I must never desist from prosecuting inquiries. 
I will live upon the interest of my share — I ought to say 
his share — in this business, and will lay up the rest for 
him. When I find him, I may perhaps throw myself upon 
his generosity; but I will yield up all to him. I will, I 
swear. As I loved and honoured her,” said Wilding, rev- 
erently kissing his hand towards the picture, and then cov- 
ering his eyes with it. “ As I loved and honoured her, and 
have a world of reasons to be grateful to her!” And so 
broke down again. 

His partner rose from the chair he had occupied, and 
stood beside him with a hand softly laid upon his shoulder. 
“ Walter, I knew you before to-day to be an upright man, 
with a pure conscience and a fine heart. It is very fortu- 
nate for me that I have the privilege to travel on in life so 
near to so trustworthy a man. I am thankful for it. Use 
me as your right hand, and rely upon me to the death. 
Don’t think the worse of me if I protest to you that my 
uppermost feeling at present is a confused, you may call it

fin unreasonable, one. I feel far more pity for the lady and 
for you, because you did not stand in your supposed rela- 
tions, than I can feel for the unknown man (if he ever 
became a man), because he was unconsciously displaced. 
You have done well in sending for Mr. Bintrey. What I 
think will be a part of his advice, I know is the whole of 
mine. Do not move a step in this serious matter precipi- 
tately. The' secret must be kept among us with great 
strictness, for to part with it lightly would be to invite 
fraudulent claims, to encourage a host of knaves, to let 
loose a flood of perjury and plotting. I have no more to 
say now, Walter, than to remind you that you sold me a 
share in your business, expressly to save yourself from 
more work than your present health is fit for, and that I 
bought it expressly to do work, and mean to do it.” 

With these words, and a parting grip of his partner’s 
shoulder that gave them the best emphasis they could have 
had, George Vendale betook himself presently to the count- 
ing-house, and presently afterwards to the address of M. 
Jules Obenreizer. 

As he turned into Soho-square, and directed his steps 
towards its north side, a deepened colour shot across his 
sun-browned face, which Wilding, if he had been a better 
observer, or had been less occupied with his own trouble, 
might have noticed when his partner read aloud a certain 
passage in their Swiss correspondent’s letter, which he had 
not read so distinctly as the rest. 

A curious colony of mountaineers has long been enclosed 
within that small flat London district of Soho. Swiss 
watch-makers, Swiss silver-chasers, Swiss jewellers, Swiss 
importers of Swiss musical boxes and Swiss toys of various 
kinds, draw close together there. Swiss professors of 
music, painting, and languages; Swiss artificers in steady 
work; Swiss couriers, and other Swiss servants chronically 
out of place; industrious Swiss laundresses and clear-starch- 
ers; mysteriously existing Swiss of both sexes; Swiss 
creditable and Swiss discreditable; Swiss to be trusted by 
all means, and Swiss to be trusted by no means; these di- 
verse Swiss particles are attracted to a centre 
of Soho. Shabby Swiss eating-houses, cofl 3 
lodging-houses; Swiss drinks and dishes, S 
Sundays, and Swiss schools for week-days 
found there. Even the native-born English

sort of btoken-English trade; announcing in their windows 
Swiss whets and drams, and sheltering in their bars Swiss 
skirmishes of love and animosity on most nights in the year. 

When the new partner in Wilding and Co. rang the bell 
of a door bearing the blunt inscription Obenreizer on a 
brass plate — the inner door of a substantial house, whose 
ground story was devoted to the sale of Swiss clocks — he 
passed at once into domestic Switzerland. A white-tiled 
stove for winter-time filled the fireplace of the room into 
which he was shown, the room’s bare floor was laid to- 
gether in a neat pattern of several ordinary woods, the 
room had a prevalent air of surface bareness and much 
scrubbing; and the little square of flowery carpet by the 
sofa, and the velvet chimney-board with its capacious clock 
and vases of artificial flowers, contended with that tone, as 
if, in. bringing out the whole effect, a Parisian had adapted 
a dairy to domestic purposes. 

Mimic water was dropping off a mill-wheel under the 
clock. The visitor had not stood before it, following it 
with his eyes, a minute, when M. Obenreizer, at his elbow, 
startled him by saying, in very good English, very slightly 
clipped : “ How do you do? So glad ! ” 

“ I beg your pardon. I didn’t hear you come in.” 

“ Not at all ! Sit, please.” 

Releasing his visitor’s two arms, which he had lightly 
pinioned at the elbows by way of embrace, M. Obenreizer 
also sat, remarking, with a smile: “You are well? So 
glad ! ” and touching his elbows again. 

“I don’t know,” said Vendale, after exchange of saluta- 
tions, “ whether you may yet have heard of me) from your 
house at Neuch&tel? ” 

“Ah, yes!” 

“ In connection with Wilding and Co.? ” 

“Ah, surely!” 

“ Is it not odd that I should come to you, in London 
here, as one of the Firm of Wilding and Co., to pay the 
Firm’s respects? ” 

“Not at all! What did I always observe when we were 
on the mountains? We call them vast; but the world is so 
little. So little is the world, that one cannot keep away 
from persons. There are so few persons in the world, that 
they continually cross and recross. So very little is the 
world, that one cannot get rid of a person. Not,” touching

his elbows again, with an ingratiatory smile, “that otoe 
would desire to get rid of you.” 

“I hope not, M. Obenreizer.” 

‘ Please call me, in your country, Mr. I call myself so, 
for I love your country. If I could be English! But I am 
born. And you? Though descended from so fine a fam- 
ily, you have had the condescension to come into trade? 
Stop though. Wines? Is it trade in England or profes- 
sion? Not fine art? ” 

“ Mr. Obenreizer,” returned Yendale, somewhat out < P 
countenance, “I was but a silly young fellow, just of age, 
when I first had the pleasure of travelling with you, and 
when you and I and Mademoiselle your niece— who is 
well? ” 

“ Thank you. Who is well.” 

“ — Shared some slight glacier dangers together. If, 
with a boy’s vanity, I rather vaunted my family, I hope I 
did so as a kind of introduction of myself. It was very 
weak, and in very bad taste; but perhaps you know our 
English proverb, ‘ Live and learn.’ ” 

“ You make too much of it,” returned the Swiss. “ And 
what the devil ! After all, yours was a fine family.” 

George Vendale’s laugh betrayed a little vexation as he 
rejoined : “Well! I was strongly attached to my parents, 
and when we first travelled together, Mr. Obenreizer, I was 
in the first flush of coming into what my father and mother 
left me. So I hope it may have been, after all, more 
youthful openness of speech and heart than boastfulness.”; 

“ All openness of speech and heart! No boastfulness ! 
cried Obenreizer. “You tax yourself too heavily. You 
tax yourself, my faith! as if you was your Government 
taxing you ! Besides, it commenced with me. I remem- 
ber, that evening in the boat upon the lake, floating among 
the reflections of the mountains and valleys, the crags and 
pine woods, which were my earliest remembrance, I drew 
a word-picture of my sordid childhood. Of our poor hut, 
by the waterfall which my mother showed to travellers; of 
the cowshed where I slept with the cow; of my idiot half- 
brother always sitting at the door, or limping down the 
Pass to beg; of my half-sister always spinning, and resting 
her enormous goitre on a great stone; of my being a fam- 
ished naked little wretch of two or three years, when they 
were men ^ ‘ Mth hard hands to beat me, I; the

only child of my father’s second marriage— if it even was 
a marriage. What more natural than for you to compare 
notes with me, and say, * We are as one by age; at that 
same time I sat upon my mother’s lap in my father’s 
carriage, rolling through the rich English streets, all lux- 
ury surrounding me, all squalid poverty kept far from me. 
Such is my earliest remembrance as opposed to yours ! ’ ” 

Mr* Obenreizer was a black-haired young man of a dark 
complexion, through whose swarthy skin no red glow ever 
shone* When colour would have come into another cheek, 
a hardly discernible beat would come into his, as if the 
machinery for bringing up the ardent blood were there, but 
the machinery were dry* He was robustly made, well* pro- 
portioned, and had handsome features. Many would have 
perceived that some surface change in him would have set 
them more at their ease with him, without being able to 
define what change. If his lips could have been made 
much thicker, and his neck much thinner, they would have 
found their want supplied. 

But the great Obenreizer peculiarity was, that a certain 
nameless film Would come over his eyes—apparently by the 
action of his own will— which would impenetrably veil, not 
only from those tellers of tales, but from his face at large, 
every expression save one of attention. It by no means 
followed that his attention should be wholly given to the 
person with whom he spoke, or even wholly bestowed on 
present sounds and objects* Rather, it Was a comprehen- 
sive watchfulness of everything he had in his own mind, 
and everything that he knew to be, or suspected to be, in 
the minds of other men* 

At this stage of the conversation, Mr. Obenreizer’ s film 
came over him. 

“The object of my present visit,” said Vendale, “is, I 
need hardly say, to assure you of the friendliness of Wild- 
ing and Go., and of the goodness of your credit with us, 
and of our desire to be of service to you. We hope shortly 
to offer you our hospitality. Things are not quite in train 
with us yet, for my partner, Mr. Wilding, is reorganising 
the domestic part of our establishment, and is interrupted 
by some private affairs. You don’t know Mr. Wilding, I 
believe? ” 

Mr. Obenreizer did not. 

“ You must come together soon. He will be glad to have

made your acquaintance, and I think I may predict that 
you will be glad to have made his. You have not been 
long established in London, I suppose, Mr. Obfcnreizer? ” 

“ It is only now that I have undertaken this agency.” 

“ Mademoiselle your niece — is— -not married? ” 

“Not married.” 

George Vendale glanced about him, as if for any tokens 
of her. 

“ She has been in London? ” 

“ She is in Londoh.” 

“ When, and where, might I haye the honour of recalling 
myself to her remembrance? ” 

Mr. Obenreizer, discarding his dim and touching his visi- 
tor’s elbows as before, said lightly: “Come up-stairs.” 

Fluttered enough by the suddenness with which the in- 
terview he had sought was coming upon him after all, 
George Vendale followed up-stairs. In a room over the 
chamber he had just quitted — a room also Swiss-appointed 
— a young lady sat near one of three windows, working at 
an embroidery-frame; and an older lady sat with, her face 
turned close to another white-tiled stove (though it was 
summer, and the stove was not lighted), cleaning gloves. 
The young lady wore all unusual quantity of fair bright 
hair, very prettily braided about a rather rounder white 
forehead than the average English type, and so her face 
might have been a shade— or say a light — rounder than the 
average English face, and her figure slightly rounder than 
the figure of the average English girl at nineteen. A re- 
markable indication of freedom an<J grace of limb, in her 
quiet attitude, and a wonderful purity and freshness of 
colour in her dimpled face and bright grey eyes, seemed 
fraught with mountain air. Switzerland, too, though the 
general fashion- of her dress was English, peeped out of the 
fanciful bodice she wore, and lurked in the Curious clocked 
red stocking, and in its- little silver-buckled shoe. As to 
the elder lady, sitting, with, her feet apart upon the lower 
brass ledge of the stove, supporting a lapful of .gloves 
while she cleaned one stretched on her left hand, she was a 
true Swiss impersonation of another kind; from the breadth 
of her cushion-like baek, and the ponderosity of her re- 
spectable legs (if the word be admissible), t6 the black vel- 
vet band tied tightly round .her throat for the. repression of 
a rising tendency to;goitre; or, higher sti^l, to her great

copper-coloured gold earring^ ; or, higher still, to her head* 
aress of black gauze stretched on wire. 

“Miss Marguerite,” said Obenreizer to the young lady, 
“do you recollect this gentleman?” 

“I think,” she answered, rising from her seat, surprised 
and a little confused : “ it is Mr. Yendale? ” 

“I think it is,” said Obenreizer, dryly* “Permit me, 
Mr. Yendale. Madame Dor.” 

The elder lady by the stove, with the glove stretched on 
her left hand, like a glover’s sign, half got up, half looked 
over her broad shoulder, and wholly plumped down again 
and rubbed away. 

“Madame Dor,” said Obenreizer, smiling, “is so kind as 
to keep me free from stain or tear. Madame Dor humours 
my weakness for being always neat, and devotes her time 
to removing every one of my specks and spots.” 

Madame Dor, with the stretched glove in the air, and 
her eyes closely scrutinising its palm, discovered a tough 
spot in Mr. Obenreizer at that moment, and rubbed hard at 
him. George Yendale took his seat by the embroidery- 
frame (having first taken the fair right hand that his en- 
trance had checked), and glanced at the gold cross that 
dipped into the bodice, with something of the devotion of a 
pilgrim who had reached his rihrine at last. Obenreizer 
stood in the middle of the room with his thumbs in his 
waistcoat-pockets, and became filmy. 

“ He was saying down-stairs, Miss Obenreizer,” observed 
Vendale, “that the world is so small a place, that people 
cannot escape one another. I have found it much too large 
for me since I saw you last.” 

“ Have you travelled so far, then? ”* she inquired. 

“Not so far, for 1 have only gone back to Switzerland 
each year; but I could have wished — and indeed I have 
wished very often — that the little world did not afford such 
opportunities for long escapes as it does. If it had been 
less, I might have found my fellow-travellers sooner, you 
know.” 

The pretty Marguerite coloured, and very slightly 
glanced in the direction of Madame Dor. 

“ You find us at length, Mr. Vendale. Perhaps you may 
lose us again.” 

“ I trust not. The curious coincidence that has enabled 
me to find you, encourages me to hope not.”

“ What is that coincidence, sir, if you please ?” A 
dainty little native touch in this turn of speech, and in ita 
tone, made it perfectly captivating, thought George Ven- 
dale, when again he noticed an instantaneous glance tow- 
ards Madame Dor. A caution seemed to be conveyed in 
it, rapid dash though it was; so he quietly took heed of 
Madame Dor from that time forth. 

“ It is that I happen to have become a partner in a house 
of business in London, to which Mr. Obenreizer happens 
this very day to be expressly recommended : and that, too, 
by another house of business in Switzerland, in which (as 
it turns out) we both have a commercial interest. He has 
not told you? ” 

“Ah!” cried Obenreizer, striking in, filmless. “No. 
I had not told Miss Marguerite. The world is so small 
and so monotonous that a surprise is Worth having in such 
a little jog-trot place. It is as he tells you, Miss Marguer- 
ite. He, of so fine a family, and so proudly bred, has con- 
descended to trade. To trade! Like us poor peasants 
who have risen from ditches ! ” 

A cloud crept over the fair brow, and she cast down he* 
eyes. 

“ Why, it is good for trade ! ” pursued Obenreizer, en- 
thusiastically. “It ennobles trade! It is the misfortune 
of trade, it is its vulgarity, that any low people — for ex- 
ample, we poor peasants — may take to it, and climb by it. 
See you, my dear Yendale I n He spoke with great energy. 
“The father of Miss Marguerite, my eldest half-brother, 
more than two times your age or mine, if living now, 
wandered without shoes, almost without rags, from that 
wretched Pass — wandered — wandered — got to be fed with 
the mules and dogs at an Inn in the main valley far away 
— got to be Boy there — got to be Ostler; — got. to be Waiter 
— got to be Cook — got to be Landlord. As Landlord, he 
took me (could he take the idiot beggar his brother, or the 
spinning monstrosity his sister?) to put as pupil to the fa- 
mous watchmaker, his neighbour and friend. His wife 
dies when Miss Marguerite is born. What is his will, and 
what are his words, to me, when he dies, she being between 
girl and woman? ‘ All for Marguerite, except so much by 
the year for you. You are young, but I make her your 
ward, for you were of the obscurest and the poorest peas- 
antry, and so was I, and so was her mother; we were ab-

ject peasants all, and yon will remember it. 5 The thing is 
equally true of most of my countrymen, now in trade in this 
your London quarter of Soho. Peasants once; low-born 
drudging Swiss peasants. Then how good and great for 
trade : ” here, from having been warm, he became playfully 
jubilant, and touched the young wine-merchant’s elbows 
again with his light embrace : “ to be exalted by gentlemen ! ” 

“I do not think so,” said Marguerite, with a flushed 
cheek, and a look away from the visitor, that was almost 
defiant. “I think it is as much exalted by us peasants.” 

“Fie, fie, Miss Marguerite,” said Obenreizer. “You 
speak in proud England.” 

“I speak in proud earnest,” she answered, quietly re- 
suming her work, “and I am not English, but a Swiss 
peasant’s daughter.” 

There was a dismissal of the subject in her words, which 
Yendale could not contend against. He only said in an 
earnest manner, “I most heartily agree with you, Miss 
Obenreizer, and I have already said so, as Mr. Obenreizer 
will bear witness,” which he by no means did, “in this 
house.” 

Now, Yendale’s eyes were quick eyes, and sharply watch- 
ing Madame Dor by times, noted something in the broad 
back view of that lady. There was considerable panto- 
mimic expression in her glove-cleaning. It had been very 
softly done when he spoke with Marguerite, or it had alto 
gether stopped, like the action of a listener. When Oben- 
reizer’ s peasant-speech came to att end, she rubbed mast 
vigorously, as if applauding it. And once or twice, as the 
glove (which she always held before her, a little about her 
face) turned in the air, or as this finger went down, or that 
went up, he even fancied that it made some telegraphic com- 
munication to Obenreizer : whose back was certainly never 
turned upon it, though he did not seem at all to heed it. 

Vendale observed, too, that in Marguerite’s dismissal of 
the subject twice forced upon him to his misrepresentation, 
there was an indignant treatment of her guardian which she 
tried to check : as though she would have flamed out against 
him, but for the influence of fear. He also observed — 
though this was not much— that he never advanced within 
the distance of her at which he first placed himself : as 
though there were limits fixed between them. Neither had 
he ever spoken of her without the prefix “ Miss,” though

whenever he uttered it, it was with the faintest trace of an 
air of mockery. And now it occurred to Vendale for the 
first time that something curious in the man which he had 
never before been able to define, was definable as a certain 
subtle essence of mockery that eluded touch or analysis. 
He felt convinced that Marguerite was in some sort a pris- 
oner as to her free will — though she held her own against 
those two combined, by the force of her character, which 
was nevertheless inadequate to her release. To feel con- 
vinced of this, was not to feel less disposed to love her 
than he had always been. In a word, he 1 was desperately 
in love with her, and thoroughly determined to pursue the 
opportunity which had opened at last. 

For the present, he merely touched upon the pleasure 
that Wilding and Co. would soon have in entreating Miss 
Obenreizer to honour their establishment with her presence 
— a curious old place, though a bachelor house withal- — and 
so did not protract his visit beyond such a visit’s .ordinary 
length. Going down-stairs, conducted by his host, he 
found the Obenreizer counting-house at the back of the en- 
trance-hall, and several shabby men in outlandish garments, 
hanging about, whom Obenreizer put aside that he might 
pass, with a few words in patois. 

“Countrymen,” he explained, as he attended Vendale to 
the door. “Poor compatriots. Grateful and attached, 
like dogs ! Good-bye. To meet again. So glad ! ” v 

Two more light touches on his elbows dismissed him into 
the street. 

Sweet Marguerite at her frame, and Madame Dor’s broad 
back at her telegraph, floated before him to Cripple Comer. 
On his arrival there, Wilding was closeted with Bintrey. 
The cellar doors happening to be open, Vendale lighted a 
candle in a cleft stick, and went down for a cellarous stroll. 
Graceful Marguerite floated before him faithfully, but Ma- 
dame Dor’s broad back remained outside. 

The vaults were very spacious, and very old. There had 
been a stone crypt down there, when bygones Were not by- 
gones; some said, part of a monkish refectory; some said, 
of a chapel; some said, of a Pagan temple. It was all 
one now. Let who would, make what he liked of a crum- 
bled pillar and a broken arch or so. Old time had made 
what he liked of it, and was quite in* nt to contradic- 
tion.

The clofee air, the musty smell, and the thunderous rum- 
bling in the streets above, as being out of the routine of or- 
dinary life, went well enough with the picture of pretty 
Marguerite holding her own against those two. So Ven- 
dale went on until, at a turning in the vaults, he saw a 
light like the light he carried. - 

" Oh ! You are here, are you, Joey? ” 

" Oughtn’t it rather to go, ‘Oh! You? re here, are you, 
Master George? ’ For it’s my business to be here. But it 
ain’t youm.” 

"Don’t grumble, Joey.” 

" Oh ! I don’t grumble,” returned the Cellarman. " If 
anything grumbles, it’s what I’ve took in through the 
pores; it ain’t me. Have a care as something in you don’t 
begin a-grumbling, Master George. Stop here long enough 
for the wapours to work, and they’ll be at it.” 

His present occupation consisted of poking his head into 
the bins, making measurements and mental calculations, 
and entering them in a rhinoceros-hide-looking note-book, 
like a piece of himself. 

" They’ll be at it,” he resumed, laying the wooden rod 
that he measured with, across two casks, entering his last 
calculation, and straightening his back, " trust ’em ! And so 
you’ve regularly come into the business. Master George? ” 
" Regularly. I hope you don’t object, Joey? ” 

" I don’t, blesB you. But Wapours objects that you’re 
too young. You’re both on you too young.” 

"We shall get over that objection day by day, Joey.” 
"Ay, Master George; but I shall day by day get over 
the objection that I’m too old, and so I shan’t be capable 
of seeing much improvement in you.” 

The retort so tickled Joey Ladle that he grunted forth a 
laugh and delivered it again, grunting forth another laugh 
after the second edition of " improvement in you. ” 

" But what’s no laughing matter, Master George,” he re- 
sumed, straightening his hack once more, "is, that Young 
Master Wilding has gone and changed the luck. Mark my 
words. He has changed the luck, and he’ll find it out. / 
ain’t been down here all my life for nothing! /know, by 
what I notices down here, when it’s a going to rain, when 
it’s a going to hold up, when it’s a going to blow, when it’s 
a going to be calm. 1 know, by what I notices down here, 
when file luck’s changed, quite as well.”

divination!” asked Vendale, holding his light towards a 
gloomy ragged growth of dark fungus, pendent from the 
arches with a very disagreeable and repellent effect. “ We 
are famous for this growth in this vault, aren’t we? ” 

“We are, Master George,” replied Joey Ladle, moving 
a step or two away, “and if you’ll be advised by me, you’ll 
let it alone.” 

Taking up the : rod just now laid across the two casks, 
and faintly moving the languid fungus with it, Vendale 
asked, “ Ay, indeed? Why so?” 

“ Why, not so much because it rises from the casks of 
wine, and may leave you to judge what sort of stuff a Cel- 
larman takes into himself when he walks in the same all 
the days of his life, nor yet so much because at a stage of 
its growth it’s maggots, and you’ll fetch ’em down upon 
you,” returned Joey Ladle, still keeping away, “as for an- 
other reason, Master George.” 

“ What other reason? ” ; 

“(I wouldn’t keep on touchin’ it, if I was you, sir.) 
I’ll tell you if you’ll come out of the place. First, take a 
look at its colour, Master George.” 

“I am doing so.” 

“Done, sir. Now, come out of the place.” 

He moved away with his light, and Vendale followed 
with his. When Vendale came up with him, and they were 
going back together, Vendale, eying him as they walked 
through the arches, said: “Well, Joey? The colour.” 

“Is it like clotted blood, Master George? ” 

“Like enough, perhaps.” 

“ More than enough, I think,” muttered Joey Ladle, shak- 
ing his head solemnly. 

“Well, say it is like; say it is exactly like. What 
then?” 

“ Master George, they do say -” 

“Who?” 

“ How should I know who? ” rejoined the Cellarman, 
apparently much exasperated by the unreasonable nature of 
the question. “ Them ! Them as says pretty well every- 
thing, you know. How should I know who They are, if 
you don’t?” 

“True. Goon.” 

“ They do say that the m^n that gets by any accident $

piece of that dark growth right upon his breast, will, for 
sure and certain, die by Murder.” 

As Vendale laughingly stopped to meet the Cellarman’s 
eyes, which he had fastened on his light while dreamily 
saying those words, he suddenly became conscious of being 
struck upon his own breast by a heavy hand. Instantly 
following with his eyes the action of the hand that struck 
him — which was his companions — he saw that it had 
beaten off his breast a web or clot of the fungus, even then 
floating to the ground. 

For a moment he turned upon the Cellarman almost as 
scared a look as the Cellarman turned upon him. But in 
another moment they had reached the daylight at the foot 
of the cellar-steps, and before he cheerfully sprang up 
them, he blew out his candle and the superstition together. 

EXIT WILDING. 

On the morning of the next day, Wilding went out alone, 
after leaving a message with his clerk. “ If Mr. Vendale 
should ask for me,” he said, “or if Mr. Bin trey should call, 
tell them I am gone to the Foundling.” All that his part- 
ner had said to him, all that his lawyer, following on the 
same side, could urge, had left him persisting unshaken in 
his own point of view. To find the lost man, whose place 
he had usurped, was now the paramount interest of his life, 
and to inquire at the Foundling was plainly to take the first 
step in the direction of discovery. To the Foundling, ac- 
cordingly, the wine-merchant now went. 

The once familiar aspect of the building was altered to 
him, as the look of the portrait over the chimney-piece was 
altered to him. His one dearest association with the place 
which had sheltered his childhood had been broken away 
from it for ever. A strange reluctance possessed him, 
when he stated his business at the door. His heart ached 
as he sat alone in the waiting-room while the Treasurer of 
the institution was being sent for to see him. When the 
interview began, it was only by a painful effort that he 
could compose himself sufficiently to mention the nature of 
his errand. 

The Treasurer listened with a face which promised all 
needful attention, and promised nothing morev 1 
. a Yfe aye obliged to be cautious,” he

to his turn to speak, “about all inquiries which are made 
by strangers.” 

“ You can hardly consider me a stranger,” answered 
Wilding, simply. “ I was one of your poor lost children 
here, in the bygone time.” 

The Treasurer politely rejoiped that this circumstance 
inspired him with a special interest in his visitor. But he 
pressed, nevertheless, for that visitor’s motive in making 
his inquiry. Without further preface, Wilding told him 
his jnotive, suppressing nothing. 

The Treasurer rose, and led the way into the room in 
which the registers of the institution were kept. “ All the 
information which our books can give is heartily at your 
service,” he said. “After the time that has elapsed, I am 
afraid it is the only information we have to offer you.” 

The books were consulted, and the entry was found, ex- 
pressed as follows : 

“3d March, 1836. Adopted, and removed from the 
Foundling Hospital, a male infant, named Walter Wilding. 
Name and condition of the person adopting the child — Mrs. 
Jane Ann Miller, widow. Address — Lime-Tree Lodge, 
Groombridge Wells. References — the Reverend John 
Harker, Groombridge Wells; and Messrs. Giles, Jeremie, 
and Giles, bankers, Lombard-street.” 

“ Is that all? ” asked the wine-merchant. “ Had you no 
after-communication with Mrs. Miller? ” 

“ None — or some reference to it must have appeared in 
this book.” 

“ May I take a copy of the entry? ” 

“Certainly! You are a little agitated. Let me make 
the copy for you.” 

“My only chance, I suppose,” said Wilding, looking 
eadly at the copy, “is to inquire at Mts. Miller’s residence, 
and to try if her references can help me? ” 

“That is the only chance I see at present,” answered the 
Treasurer. “ I heartily wish I could have been of Borne 
further assistance to you.” 

With those farewell words to comfort him, Wilding set 
forth on the journey of investigation which began from the 
Foundling doors. The first stage to make for, was plainly 
the house of business of the bankers in Lombard-street. 
Two of the partners in the firm were inaccessible to chance- 
visitors when he asked for them. The third, after raising

certain inevitable difficulties, consented to let a clerk ex- 
amine the Ledger marked with the initial letter “M.” 
The account of Mrs. Miller, widow, of Groombridge Wells, 
was found. Two long lines, in faded ink, were drawn 
across it; and at the bottom of the page there appeared this 
note: “ Account closed, September 30th, 1837.” 

So the first stage of the journey was reached — and so it 
ended in No Thoroughfare! After sending a note to Crip- 
ple Comer to inform his partner that his absence might be 
prolonged for some hours, Wilding took his place in the 
train, and started for the second stage on the journey — 
Mrs. Miller’s residence at Groombridge Wells. 

Mothers and children travelled with him; mothers and 
children met each other at the station ; mothers and chil- 
dren were in the shops when he entered them to inquire for 
Lime-Tree Lodge. Everywhere, the nearest and dearest of 
human relations showed itself happily in the happy light 
of day. Everywhere, he was reminded of the treasured 
delusion from which he . had been awakened so cruelly — of 
the lost memory which had passed from him like a reflec- 
tion from a glass. 

Inquiring here, inquiring there, he could hear of no such 
place as Lime-Tree Lodge. Passing a house-agent’s office, 
he went in wearily, and put the question for the last time. 
The house-agent pointed across the street to a dreary man- 
sion of many windows, which might have been a manu- 
factory, but which was an hotel. “ That’s where Lime- 
Tree Lodge stood, sir,” said the man, “ten years ago.” 

The second stage reached, and No Thoroughfare again ! 

But one chance was left. The clerical reference, Mr. 
Harker, still remained to be found. Customers coming in 
at the moment to occupy the house-agent’s attention, Wild- 
ing went down the street, and, entering a bookseller’s shop, 
asked if he could be informed of the Reverend John Har- 
ker’s present address. 

The bookseller looked unaffectedly shocked and aston- 
ished, and made no answer. 

Wilding repeated his question. 

The bookseller took up from his counter a prim little 
volume in a binding of sober grey. He handed it to his 
visitor, open at the title-page. Wilding read : 

“The martyrdom of the, Reverend John Harker in Nev, 
Zealand; Related by a former member of his flock. ”

Wilding put the book down on the counter. “ I beg your 
pardon, ” he said, thinking a little, perhaps, of his own 
present martyrdom while he spoke. The silent bookseller 
acknowledged the apology by a bow. Wilding went out. 

Third and last stage, and No Thoroughfare for the third 
and last time. 

There was nothing more to be done; there was abso- 
lutely no choice but to go back to London, defeated at all 
points. From time to time on the return journey, the 
wine-merchant looked at his copy of the entry in the 
Foundling Register. There is one among the many forms 
of despair — perhaps the most pitiable of all — which per- 
sists in disguising itself as Hope. Wilding checked him- 
self in the act of throwing the useless morsel of paper out 
of the carriage window. “It .may lead to something yet,” 
he thought. “ While I live, I won’t part with it. When 
I die, my executors shall find it sealed up with my will.” 

Now, the mention of his will set the good wine-merchant 
on a new track of thought, without diverting his mind from 
its engrossing subject. He must make his will immedi- 
ately. 

The application of the phrase, No Thoroughfare, to the 
case had originated with Mr. Bintrey. In their first long 
conference following the discovery, that sagacious personage 
had a hundred times repeated, with an obstructive shake of 
the head, “No Thoroughfare, sir, No Thoroughfare. My 
belief is that there is no way out of this at this time of 
day, and my advice is, make yourself comfortable where you 
are.” 

In the course of the protracted consultation, a magnum of 
the forty-five year old port wine had been produced for the 
wetting of Mr. Bintrey’ s legal whistle; but the more clearly 
he saw his way through the wine, the more emphatically he 
did not see his way through the case; repeating as often as 
he set his glass down empty, “Mr. Wilding; No Thorough- 
fare. Rest and be thankful.” 

It is certain that the honest wine-merchant’s anxiety to 
make a will originated in profound conscientiousness; 
though it is possible (and quite consistent with his recti- 
tude) that he may unconsciously have derived some feeling 
of relief from the prospect of delegating his own difficulty 
to two other men who were to come after him. Be that as 
it may, he pursued his new track of thought with great

ardour, and lost no time in begging George Vendale and 
Mr. Bin trey to meet him in Cripple Comer and share his 
confidence. 

“ Being all three assembled with olosed doors,” said Mr. 
Bin trey, addressing the new partner on the occasion, “ I 
wish to observe, before our friend (and my client) entrusts 
us with his further views, that I have endorsed what I un- 
derstand from him to have been your advice, Mr. Vendale, 
and what would be the advice of every sensible man. I 
have told him that he positively must keep his secret. I 
have spoken with Mrs. Goldstraw, both in his presence 
and in his absence; and if anybody is to be trusted (which 
is a very large IF), I think she is to be trusted to that ex- 
tent. I have pointed out to our friend (and my client), 
that to set on foot random inquiries would not only be to 
raise the Devil, in the likeness of all the swindlers in the 
kingdom, but would also be to waste the estate. Now, you 
see, Mr. Vendale, our friend (and my client) does not de- 
sire to waste the estate, but, on the contrary, desires to 
husband it for what he considers — but I can’t say I do — 
the rightful owner, if such rightful owner should ever be 
found. Iam very much mistaken if he ever will be, but 
never mind that. Mr. Wilding and I are, at least, agreed 
that the estate is not to be wasted. Now, I have yielded 
to Mr. Wilding’s desire to keep an advertisement at inter- 
vals flowing through the newspapers, cautiously inviting 
any person who may know anything about that adopted in- 
fant, taken from the Foundling Hospital, to come to my 
office; and I have pledged myself that such advertisement 
shall regularly appear. I have gathered from our friend 
(and my client) that I meet you here to-day to take his in- 
structions, not to give him advice. I am prepared to receive 
his instructions, and to respect his wishes; but you will 
please observe that this does not imply my approval of 
either as a matter of professional opinion.” 

Thus Mr. Bintrey; talking quite as much at Wilding as 
to Vendale. And yet, in spite of his care for his client, he 
was so amused by his client’s Quixotic conduct, as to eye 
him from time to time with twinkling eyes, in the light of 
a highly comical curiosity. 

“Nothing;” observed Wilding, “can be clearer. I only 
wish my head were as clear as yours, Mr. Bintrey.”

lawyer, with an alarmed glance, “put it off. — I inean the 
interview. ” 

“Not at all, I thank you-,” said Wilding. “ What was 1 
going to ” 

“ Don’t excite yourself, Mr. Wilding,” urged the lawyer. 

“ No; I wasn't going to,” said the wine-merchant. “ Mr. 
Bin trey and George Yendale, would you have any hesita- 
tion or objection to become my joint trustees and executors, 
or can you at once consent? ” 

“/consent,” replied George Yendale, readily. 

“ 1 consent,” said Bin trey, not so readily. 

“Thank you both. Mr. Bintrey, my instructions for my 
last will and testament are short and plain. Perhaps you 
will now have the goodliest to take them down. I leave 
the whole of my real and personal estate, without any ex- 
ception or reservation whatsoever, to you two, my joint 
trustees and executors, in trust to pay over the whole to 
the true Walter Wilding, if he shall be found and identi- 
fied within two years after the day of my death. Failing 
that, in trust to you two to pay over the whole as a bene- 
faction and legacy to the Foundling Hospital;” 

“Those are all your instructions, are they, Mr. Wild- 
ing?” demanded Bintrey, after a blank silence, during 
which nobody had looked at anybody. 

“The whole.” 

“ And as to those instructions, you have absolutely made 
up your mind, Mr. Wilding? ” 

“Absolutely, decidedly, finally.” 

“It only remains,” said the lawyer, with one shrug of 
his shoulders, “to get them into technical and binding 
form, and to execute and attest. Now, does that press? Is 
there any hurry about it? You are not going to die yet, 
sir.” 

“Mr. Bintrey,” answered Wilding, gravely, “when^I 
am going to die is within other knowledge than yours or 
mine. I shall be glad to have this matter off my mind, if 
you please.” 

“We are lawyer and client again,” rejoined Bintrey, 
who, for the nonce, had become almost sympathetic. “ If 
this day week — here, at the same hour — will suit Mr. Yen- 
dale and yourself, I will enter in my Diary that I attend 
you accordingly.” 

The appointment was made, and in due sequence kept.

The will was formally signed, sealed, delivered, and wit- 
nessed, and was carried off by Mr. Bintrey for safe storage 
among the papers of his clients, ranged in their respective 
iron boxes, with their respective owners’ names outside, on 
iron tiers in his consulting-room, as if that legal sanctuary 
were a condensed Family Vault of Clients. 

With more heart than he had lately had for former sub- 
jects of interest, Wilding then set about completing his 
patriarchal establishment, being much assisted not only by 
Mrs. Goldstraw but by Vendale too: who, perhaps, had in 
his mind the giving of an Obenreizer dinner as soon as pos- 
sible. Anyhow, the establishment being reported in sound 
working order, the Obenreizers, Guardian and Ward, were 
asked to dinner, and Madame Dor was included in the in- 
vitation. If Vendale had been over head and ears in love 
before — a phrase not to be taken as implying the faintest 
doubt about itr— this dinner plunged him down in love ten 
thousand fathoms deep. Yet, for the life of him, he could 
not get one word alone with charming Marguerite. So 
surely as a blessed moment seemed to come, Obenreizer, in 
his filmy state, would stand at Vendale’s elbow, or the 
broad back of Madame Dor would appear before his eyes. 
That speechless matron was never seen in a front view, 
from the moment of her arrival to that of her departure — 
except at dinner. And from the instant of her retirement 
to the drawing-room, after a hearty participation in that 
meal, she turned her face to the wall again. 

Yet, through four or five delightful though distracting 
hours, Marguerite was to be seen, Marguerite was to be 
heard, Marguerite was to be occasionally touched. When 
they made the round of the old dark cellars, Vendale led 
her by the hand; when she sang to him in the lighted room 
at night, Vendale, standing by her, held her relinquished 
gloves, and would have bartered against them every drop 
of the forty-five year old, though it had been forty-five 
times forty-five years old, and its net price forty-five times 
forty-five pounds per dozen. And still, when she was 
gone, and a great gap of an extinguisher was clapped on 
Cripple Comer, he tormented himself by wondering, Did 
she think that he admired her ! Did she think that he 
adored her! Did she suspect that she had won him, heart 
and soul ! Did she care to think at all about it ! And so, 
Did she and Didn’t she, up and down the gamut, and above

the line ahd below the line, dear, dear ! Poor restless heart 
of humanity! To think that the men who were mummies 
thousands of years , ago, did the same, and ever found the 
secret how to be quiet after it ! 

“ What do you think, George,” Wilding asked him next 
day, “of Mr. Obenreizer? (I won’t ask you what you 
think of Miss Obenreizer.)” 

“I don’t know,” said Vendale, “and I never did know, 
what to think of him.” 

“He is well informed and clever,” said Wilding. 

“Certainly clever.” 

“A good musician.” (He had played very well, and 
sung very well, overnight.) 

“ Unquestionably a good musician.” 

“ And talks well.” 

“Yes,” said George Vendale, ruminating, “and talks 
well.' Do you know, Wilding, it oddly occurs to me, as I 
think about him, that he doesn’t keep silence well! ” 

“How do you mean? He is not obtrusively talkative.” 

“No, and I don’t mean that. But when he is silent, you 
can hardly help vaguely, though perhaps most unjustly, 
mistrusting him. Take people whom you know and like. 
Take any one you know and like.” 

“Soon done, my good fellow,” said Wilding. “I take 
you.” 

“I didn’t bargain for that, or foresee it,” returned Ven- 
dale, laughing. “However, take me. Reflect for a mo- 
ment. Is your approving knowledge of my interesting face 
mainly founded (however various the momentary express 
sions it may include) on my face when I am silent? ” 

“ I think it is,” said Wilding. 

“ I think so too. Now, you see, when Obenreizer speaks 
— in other words, when he is allowed to explain himself 
away — he comes out right enough; but when he has not 
the opportunity of explaining himself away, he comes out 
rather wrong. Therefore it is, that I say he does not keep 
silence well. And passing hastily in review such faces as 
X know, and don’t trust, I am inclined to think, now I give 
my mind to it, that none of them keep silence well.” 

This proposition in Physiognomy being new to Wilding, 
he was at first slow to admit it, until asking himself the 
question whether Mrs. Goldstraw kept silence well, and r©7 
membering that her face in repose decidedly invited tjr

fulness, he was as glad as men usually are to believe what 
they desire to believe. 

But, as he was very slow to regain his spirits or his 
health, his partner, as another means of setting him up — 
and perhaps also with contingent Obenreizer views — re- 
minded him of those musical schemes of his in connection 
with his family, and how a singing-class was to be formed 
in the house, and a Choir in a neighbouring church. The 
class was established speedily, and two or three of the peo- 
ple having already some musical knowledge, and singing 
tolerably, the Choir soon followed. The latter was led 
and chiefly taught, by Wilding himself : who had hopes of 
converting his dependents into so many Foundlings, in re- 
spect of their capacity to sing sacred choruses. 

Now, the Obenreizers being skilled musicians it was eas- 
ily brought to pass that they should be asked to join these 
musical unions. Guardian and Ward consenting, or Guar- 
dian consenting for both, it was necessarily brought to pass 
that Vendale’ s life became a life of absolute thraldom 
and enchantment. For, in the mouldy Christopher- Wren 
church on Sundays, with its dearly beloved brethren assem- 
bled and met together, five-and-twenty strong, was not that 
Her voice that shot like light into the darkest places, thrill- 
ing the walls and pillars as though they were pieces of his 
heart! What time, too, Madame Dor in a corner of the 
high pew, turning her back upon everybody and every- 
thing, could not fail to be ftitualistically right at some mo- 
ment of the service; like the man whom the doctors recom- 
mended to get drunk once a month, and who, that he might 
not overlook it, got drunk every day. 

But, even those seraphic Sundays were surpassed by the 
Wednesday concerts established for the patriarchal family. 
At those concerts she would sit down to the piano and sing 
them, in her own tongue, songs of her own land, songs call- 
ing from the mountain-tops to Vendale, “ Rise above the 
grovelling level country; come far away from the crowd; 
pursue me as I mount higher, higher, higher, melting into 
the azure distance; rise to my supremest height of all, and 
love me here ! ” Then would the pretty bodice, the clocked 
stocking, and the silver-buckled shoe be, like the broad 
forehead and the bright eyes, fraught with the spring of a 
very chamois, until the strain was over. 

Not even over Vendale himself did these songs of hers

cast a more potent spell than over Joey Ladle in his differ- 
ent way. Steadily refusing to muddle the harmony by tak- 
ing any share in it, and evincing the supremest contempt 
for scales and such like rudiments of music — which, in- 
deed, seldom captivate mere listeners — ^Joey did at first 
give up the whole business for a bad job, and the whole of 
the performers for a set of howling Dervishes. But, der 
scrying traces of unmuddled harmotiy in a part-song one 
day, he gave his two under-cellarmen faint hopes of get- 
ting on towards something in course of time. An anthem 
of Handel’s led. to further encouragement from him: 
though he objected that that great musician must have 
been down in some of them foreign cellars pretty much, for 
to go and say the same thing so many times over; which, 
took it in how you might, he considered a certain sign of 
your having took it in somehow. On a third occasion, the 
public appearance of Mr. Jarvis with a flute, and of an odd 
man with a violin, and the performance of a duet by the 
two, did so astonish him that, solely of his own impulse 
and motion, he became inspired with the words, “Ann 
Koar ! ” repeatedly pronouncing them as if calling in a 
familiar manner for some lady who had distinguished her- 
self in the orchestra. But this was his final testimony to 
the merits of his mates, for, the instrumental duet being 
performed at the first Wednesday concert, and being pres- 
ently followed by the voice of Marguerite Obenreizer, he 
sat with his mouth wide open, entranced, until she had fin- 
ished; when, rising in his place with much solemnity, and 
prefacing what he was about to say with a bow that spe- 
cially included Mr. Wilding in it, he delivered himself of 
the gratifying sentiment: “Arter that, ye may all on ye 
get to bed ! ” And ever afterwards declined to render hom- 
age in any other words to the musical powers of the family. 

Thus began a separate personal acquaintance between 
Marguerite Obenreizer and Joey Ladle. She laughed so 
heartily at his compliment, and yet was so abashed by it, 
that Joey made bold to say to her, after the concert was 
over, he hoped he wasn’t so muddled in his head as to have 
took a liberty? She made him a gracious reply, and Joey 
ducked in return. 

“ You’ll change the luck time about, Miss,” said Joey, 
dueking again. “It’s such as you in the place that can 
bring round the luck of the place.”

“ Can I? Round the luck? ” she answered, in her pretty 
English, and with a pretty wonder. “ I fear I do not un- 
derstand. I am so stupid.” 

“Young Master Wilding, Miss,” Joey explained confi- 
dentially, though not much to her enlightenment, “ changed 
the luck, afore he took in young Master George. So I say, 
and so they’ll find. Lord! Only come into the place and 
sing over the luck a few times, Miss, and it won’t be able 
to help itself ! ” 

With this, and with a whole brood of ducks, Joey backed 
out of the presence. But Joey being a privileged person, 
and even an involuntary conquest being pleasant to youth 
and beauty, Marguerite merrily looked out for him next 
time. 

“ Where is my Mr. Joey, please? ” she asked of Yendale. 

So Joey was produced and shaken hands with, and that 
became an Institution. 

Another Institution arose in this wise. Joey was a little 
hard of hearing. He himself said it was “ Wapours,” and 
perhaps it might have been; but whatever the cause of the 
effect, there the effect was, upon him. On this first occa- 
sion he had been seen to sidle along the wall, with his left 
hand to his left ear, until he had sidled himself into a seat 
pretty near the singer, in which place and position he had 
remained, until addressing to his friends the amateurs the 
compliment before mentioned. It was observed on the fol- 
lowing Wednesday that Joey’s action as a Pecking Machine 
Was impaired at dinner, and it was rumoured about the 
table that this was explainable by his high-strung expecta- 
tions of Miss Obenreizer’s singing, and his fears of not get- 
ting a place where he could hear every note and syllable. 
The rumour reaching Wilding’s ears, he in his good nature 
called Joey to the front at night before Marguerite began. 
Thus the Institution came into being that on succeeding 
nights, Marguerite, running her hands over the keys before 
singing, always said to Yendale, “Where is my Mr. Joey, 
please? ” and that Vendale always brought him forth, and 
stationed him near by. That he should then, when all 
eyes were upon' him, express in his face the utmost con- 
tempt for the exertions of his friends and confidence in 
Marguerite alone, whom he would stand contemplating, not 
unlike the rhinoceros out of the spelling-book, tamed and 
on his hind legs, was a part of the Institution. Also that

'when he remained after the singing in his most ecstatic 
state, some bold spirit from the back should say", “ What 
do you think of it, Joey? ” and he should be goaded to re- 
ply, as having that instant oonceived the retort, “ Arter 
that ye may all on ye get to bfcd l These were ! other parts 
of the Institution. 

But the simple pleasures and small jests of Cripple Cor- 
ner were not destined to have a long life. Underlying 
them from the first was a serious matter, which every mem- 
ber of the patriarchal family knew of, but which, by tacit 
agreement, all forbore to speak of. Mr. Wilding’s health 
was in a bad way. i 

He might have overcome the shock he had sustained in 
the one great affection of his life, or he might have over- 
come his consciousness of being in the enjoytnent of an- 
other man’s property; but the two together were too much 
for him. A man haunted by twin ghosts, he became 
deeply depressed. The inseparable spectres feat at the 
board with him, ate from his platter, drank from his cup, 
and stood by his bedside at night. When he recalled his 
supposed mother’s love, he felt as though he had stolen it. 
When he rallied a little under the respect and attachment 
of his dependents, he felt as though he were even fraudu- 
lent in making them happy, for that should have been the 
unknown man’s duty and gratification. 

Gradually, under the pressure of his brooding mind, his 
body stooped, his step lost its elasticity, his eyes were sel- 
dom lifted from the ground. He knew he could not help 
the deplorable mistake that had been made, but he knew 
he could not mend it; for the days and weeks went by, and 
no one claimed his name or his possessions. , . And now there 
began to creep over him a cloudy consciousness of often re- 
curring confusion in his head. He would unaccountably 
lose, sometimes whole hours, sometimes a whole day and 
night. Once, his remembrance stopped as he sat at the 
head of the dinner-table, and was blank until daybreak. 
Another time, it stopped as he was beating time to their 
singing, and went on again when he' and his partner were 
walking in the courtyard by the light of the moon, half the 
night latef. He asked Vendale (always full of consider- 
ation, work, and help) how this was? Vendale only re- 
plied, u You have not, been quite well; that’s all.” Wa

they would put it. off with, “Glad to see you looking so 
much better, sir; ” or “ Hope you’re doing nicely now, sir;” 
in which was no information at all. 

At length, when the partnership was but five months old, 
Walter Wilding took to his bed, and his housekeeper be- 
came his nurse. 

“ Lying here, perhaps you will not mind my calling you 
Sally, Mrs; Goldstraw? ” said the poor wine-merchant. 

“ It sounds more natural to me, sir, than any other name, 
and I like it better.” 

“ Thank you, Sally. I think, Sally, I must of late have 
been subject to fits. Is that so, Sally? Don’t mind telling 
me now.” 

“It has happened, sir.” 

“ Ah ! That .is the explanation ! ” he quietly remarked. 
“ Mr. Obenreizer, Sally, talks of the world being so small 
that it is not strange how often the same people come to- 
gether, and come together, at various places, and in various 
stages of life. But it does seem strange, Sally, that I 
should, as I may say, come round to the Foundling to die.” 

He extended his hand to her, and she gently took it. 

“ You are not going to die, dear Mr. Wilding.” 

“ So Mr. Bintrey said, but I think he was wrong. The 
old ehild-feeling is coming back upon me, Sally. The old 
hush and rest, as I used to fall asleep.” 

After an interval he said, in a placid voice, “ Please kiss 
me, Nurse,” and, it was evident, believed himself to be 
lying in the old Dormitory. 

As she had been used to bend over the fatherless and 
motherless children; Sally bent over the fatherless and 
motherless man, and put her lips to his forehead, murmur- 
ing : 

“ God bless you ! ” 

“ God bless you ! ” he replied, in the same tone. 

After another interval, he opened his eyes in his own 
character, and said: “Don’t move me, Sally, because of 
what I am going to say; I lie quite easily. I think my 
time is come. I don’t know how it may appear to you, 
Sally, but ” 

Insensibility fell upon him for a few minutes ; he emerged 
from it once more.

When he had thus conscientiously finished' his favoiirite 
sentence, his time came, and he died. . / • 

ACT II. 

VENDALB MAKES LOVE. 

Th£’ summer and the autumn had passed. Christmas 
and the New Year were at hand. 

As executors honestly bent on performing their duty 
towards the dead, Yendale and Bintrey had held more than 
one anxious consultation on the subject of Wilding's will. 
The lawyer had declared, from the first, that it was simply 
impossible to take any useful action in the matter at all. 
The only obvious inquiries to make, in relation to the Lost 
man, had been made already by Wilding himself; with 
this result, that time and death together had not left a 
trace of him discoverable. To advertise for the claimant 
to the property, it would be necessary to mention particu- 
lars — a course of proceeding which would invite half the 
impostors in England to present themselves in the charac- 
ter of the true Walter Wilding. “If we find a chaiioe of 
tracing the lost man, we will take it. If we donuts; let us 
meet for another consultation on the first anniversary of 
Wilding’s death.” So Bintrey advised. And so, with the 
most earnest desire to fulfil his dead friend’s wishes, Yen- 
dale was fain to let the matter rest for the present. 

Turning from his interest in’ the past to his interest in 
the future, Vendale still found himself confronting a 
doubtful prospect. Months on months had passed since 
his first visit to Soho- square— and through all that time, 
the one language in which he had told Marguerite that he 
loved her was the language of the eyes* assisted, at conve- 
nient opportunities, by the language of the hand. 

What was the obstacle in his way? The one immovable 
obstacle which had been in' his way from the first. No 
matter how fairly the opportunities looked, Yendale’s 
efforts to speak with Marguerite alone, ended invariably in 
one and the same result. Under the most accidental cir- 
cumstances, in the most innocent manner possible, Oben- 
reizer was always in the way. 

With the last days of the old year came an unexpected 
chance of spending an evening with Marguerite, wkfr"*** 
Vendale resolved should be a chance of speaking prb

to her as wtell. A cordial note from Obenreizer invited 
him, on New Year’s Day, to a little family dinner in Soho- 
square. “We shall be only four,” the note said. “We 
shall be only two,” Vendale determined, “before the even- 
ing is out ! ” 

New Year’s Day among the English, is associated with 
the giving and receiving of dinners, and with nothing 
more. New Year’s Day, among the foreigners, is the 
grand opportunity of the year for the giving and receiving 
of presents. It is occasionally possible to acclimatise a 
foreign custom. In this instance Vendale felt no hesita- 
tion about making the attempt. His one difficulty was to 
decide what his New Year’s gift to Marguerite should be. 
The defensive pride of the peasant’s daughter — morbidly 
sensitive to the inequality between her social position and 
his — would be secretly roused against him if he ventured 
on a rich offering. A gift, which a poor man’s purse might 
purchase, was the one gift that could be trusted to find its 
way to her heart, for the giver’s sake. Stoutly resisting 
temptation, in the form of diamonds and rubies, Vendale 
bought a brooch of the filigree- work of Genoa— the sim- 
plest- and most unpretending ornament that he could find 
in the jeweler’s shop. 

He slipped his gift into Marguerite’s hand as she held it 
out to welcome him on the day of the dinner. 

“ This is your first New Year's Day in England,” he said. 
“ Will you let me help to make it like a New Year’s Day 
at home? ’* 

She thanked him, a little constrainedly, as she looked at 
the jeweller’s box, uncertain what it might contain. Open- 
ing the box, and discovering the studiously simple form 
under which Vendale’s little, keepsake offered itself to her, 
she penetrated his motive on the spot. Her face turned on 
him brightly, with a look which said, “I own you have 
pleased and flattered me.” Never had she been so charm- 
ing, in Vendale’s eyes, as she was at that moment. Her 
winter dress — a petticoat of dark silk, with a bodice of 
black velvet rising to her neck, and enclosing it softly in a 
little circle of swansdown — heightened, by all the force of 
contrast, the dazzling fairness of her hair and her complex- 
ion. It was only when she turned aside from him to the 
glass, and, taking out the brooch that she wore, put his 
New Year’s gift in its place, that Vendale’s attention wan-

dered far enough away from her to disqover the presence of 
other persons in the room. He now became conscious that 
the hands of Obenreizer were affectionately in possession of 
his elbows. He now heard the voice of Obenreizer thank- 
ing him for his attention to Marguerite* with the faintest 
possible: ring of mockery in its tone. (“Such a simple 
present, dear sir! and showing such nice tact! ”) He now 
discovered, for the first . time, that there was one other 
guest, and but one, besides himself, whom Obenreizer pre- 
sented as a compatriot and friend. The friend’s face was 
mouldy, and the friend’s figure was fat t His age was sug- 
gestive of the autumnal period of human life. In the course 
of the evening he developed two extraordinary capacities. 
One was a capacity for silence; the other was a, capacity 
for emptying bottles. 

Madame Dor was not in the room. Neither, was there 
any visible place reserved for her when they sat down tQ 
table. Obenreizer explained that it was “the good Dor’s 
simple habit to dine always in the mijddlq.of the day. She 
would make her excuses later in the evening.” Vendale 
wondered whether the good Dor had, on this occasion, va- 
ried her domestic employment from cleaning Obenreizqr’s 
gloves to cooking Obenreizer’ a dinner. • This at least was 
certain — the dishes served were, one and all, as achieve- 
ments in cookery, high above the reach of the rude element- 
ary art of England. The dinner was unobtrusively per- 
fect. As for the wine, the eyes of the speechless friend 
rolled over it, as in solemn ecstasy. Sometimes he said 
“Good!” when a bottle came in full; and sometimes he 
said “ Ahl ” when a bottle went out empty — and there his 
contributions to the gaiety of the evening ended. 

Silence is occasionally infectious. Oppressed by private 
anxieties of their own, Marguerite and Vendale appeared to 
feel the influence of the speechless friend. The whole re- 
sponsibility of keeping the talk going rested on Obenreizer’s 
shoulders, and manfully did Obenreizer sustain it. He 
opened his heart in the character of an enlightened for- 
eigner, and sang the praises of England. When other top* 
ies ran dry, he returned to this inexhaustible source* and 
always set the stream running again as. copiously as ever. 
Obenreizer would have given an arm, an eye, or a leg to 
have been bom an Englishman. Out of England the$*-«**

no such object as a beautiful woman. His dear Miss Mar- 
guerite would excuse him, if he accounted for her attrac- 
ti6ns on the theory that English blood must have mixed at 
some former time with their obscure and unknown ances- 
try. Survey this English nation, and behold a tall, clean, 
plump, and solid people! Look at their cities! What 
magnificence in their public buildings ! What admirable 
order and propriety in their streets ! Admire their laws, 
combihing the eternal principle of justice with the other 
eternal principle of pounds, shillings, and pence; and ap- 
plying the product to all civil injuries, from an injury to a 
man’s honour, to an injury to a man’s nose! You have 
ruined my daughter — pounds, shillings, and pence ! You 
have knocked me down with a blow in my face — pounds, 
shillings, and pence! Where was the material prosperity 
of such a country as that to stop? Obenreizer, projecting 
himself into the future, failed to see the end of it. Oben- 
reizer’ s enthusiasm entreated permission to exhale itself, 
English fashion, in a toast. Here is our modest little din- 
ner over, here is our frugal dessert on the table, and here 
is the admirer of England conforming to national customs, 
and making a speech ! A toast to your white cliffs of Al- 
bion, Mr. Yendale ! to your national virtues, your charming 
climate, and your fascinating women ! to your Hearths, to 
your Homes, to your Habeas Corpus, and to all your other 
institutions ! In one word — to England ! Heep-heep-heep ! 
hooray ! 

Obenreizer’ s voice had barely chanted the last note of the 
English cheer, the speechless friend had barely drained 
the last drop out of his glass, when the festive proceedings 
were interrupted by a modest tap at the door. A woman- 
servant came in, and approached her master with a little 
note in her hand. Obenreizer opened the note with a 
frbwn; and, after reading it with an expression of genuine 
annoyance, passed it on to his compatriot and friend. 
Vendale’s spirits rose as he watched these proceedings. 
Had he found an ally in the annoying little note? Was 
the long-looked-for chance actually coming at last? 

“ I am afraid there is no help for it? ” said Obenreizer, 
addressing his fellow-countryman. “ I am afraid we must 
go.” 

The speechless friend handed back the letter, shrugged 
his heavy shoulders, and poured himself out a last glass of

wine. His fat fingers lingered fondly round the neck of 
the bottle. They pressed it with a little amatory squeeze 
at parting. His globular eyes looked dimly, as through an 
intervening haze, at Vendale and Marguerite. His heavy 
articulation laboured, and brought forth a whole sentence 
at a birth. “ I think,” he said, “ I should have liked a lit- 
tle more wine.” His breath failed him after that effort; 
be gasped, and walked to the door. 

Obenreizer addressed himself to Vendale with an appear- 
ance of the deepest distress. 

“ I am so shocked, so confused, so distressed,” he began. 
“A misfortune has happened to one of my compatriots. 
He is alone, he is ignorant of your language — I and my 
good friend, here, have no choice but to go and help him. 
What can I say in my excuse? How can I describe my 
affliction at depriving myself in this way of the honour of 
your company?” 

He paused, evidently expecting to see Vendale take up 
his hat and retire. Discerning his opportunity at last, 
Vendale determined to do nothing of the kind. He met 
Obenreizer dexterously, with Obenreizer’ s own weapons. 

“ Pray don’t distress yourself,” he said. “ I’ll wait here 
with the greatest pleasure till you come back.” 

Marguerite blushed deeply, and turned away to her em- 
broidery-frame in a corner by the window. The film 
showed itself in Obenreizer ’s eyes, and the smile came 
something sourly to Obenreizer’ s lips. To have told Ven- 
dale that there was no reasonable prospect of his coming 
back in good time would have been to risk offending a man 
whose favourable opinion was of solid commercial impor- 
tance to him. Accepting his defeat with the best possible 
grace, he declared himself to be equally honoured and de- 
lighted by Vendale’s proposal. “So frank, so friendly, so 
English ! ” He bustled about, apparently looking for some- 
thing he wanted, disappeared for a moment through the 
folding-doors communicating with the next room, came 
back with his hat and coat, and protesting that he would 
return at the earliest possible moment, embraced Vendale’s 
elbows, and vanished from the scene in company with the 
speechless friend. 

Vendale turned to the comer by the window, in which 
Marguerite had placed herself with her work. There, as 
if she had dropped frotn the ceiling, or come up through

the floor — there, in the old attitude, with her face to the 
stove — sat an Obstacle that had not been foreseen, in the 
person of Madame Dor ! She half got up, half looked over 
her broad shoulder at Vendale, and plumped down again. 
Was she at work? Yes. Cleaning Obenreizer’s gloves, as 
before? No; darning Obenreizer’s stockings. 

The case was now desperate. Two serious considerations 
presented themselves to Yendale. Was it possible to put 
Madame Dor into the stove? The stove wouldn’t hold her. 
Was it possible to treat Madame Dor, not as a living wom- 
an but as an article of furniture? Could the mind be 
brought to contemplate this respectable matron purely in 
the light of a chest of drawers, with a black gauze head- 
dress accidentally left on the top of it? Yes, the mind 
could be brought to do that. With a comparatively trifling 
effort, Yendale’ s mind did it. As he took his place on the 
old-fashioned window-seat, close by Marguerite and her 
embroidery, a slight movement appeared in the chest of 
drawers, but no remark issued from it. Let it be remem- 
bered that solid furniture is not easy to move, and that it 
has this advantage in consequence — there is no fear of up- 
setting it. 

Unusually silent and unusually constrained — with the 
bright colour fast fading from her face, with a feverish 
energy possessing her fingers — the pretty Marguerite bent 
over her embroidery, and worked as if her life depended on 
it. Hardly less agitated himself, Vendale felt the impor- 
tance of leading her very gently to the avowal which he 
was eager to make — to the other sweeter avowal still, 
which he was longing to hear. A woman’s love is never 
to be taken by storm; it yields insensibly to a system of 
gradual approach. It ventures by the roundabout way, 
and listens to the low voice. Vendale led her memory 
back to their past meetings when they were travelling to- 
gether in Switzerland. They revived the impressions, they 
recalled the events, of the happy bygone time. Little by 
little, Marguerite’s constraint vanished. She smiled, she 
wa6 interested, she looked at Vendale, she grew idle 
with her needle, she made false stitches in her work. 
Their voices sank lower and lower; their faces bent 
nearer and nearer to each other as they spoke. And Ma- 
dame Dor? Madame Dor behaved like an angel. She 
never looked round; she never said a word; she went on

with Obenreizer’s stockings. Pulling : each stocking 1 up 
tight over her left arm, and holding that arm aloft from 
time to time, to catch the light on her work, there /were 
moments, delicate and indescribable moments, when.MA- 
dame Dor appeared to be sitting upside down, and. con- 
templating one of her own respectable legs elevated in the 
air. As the minutes wore on, these elevations followed 
each other at longer and longer intervals. Now and again, 
the black gauze head-dress nodded, dropped forward, re- 
covered itself. A little heap of stockings slid softly from 
Madame Dor’s lap, and remained unnoticed on the, floor.' 
A prodigious ball of worsted followed the stockings, and 
rolled lazily under the table. The black gauze head-dress 
nodded, dropped forward, recovered itself, nodded again, 
dropped forward again, and recovered itself ; no more. A 
composite sound, partly as of the purring of an immense 
cat, partly as of the planing of a soft board, rose over the 
hushed voices of the lovers, and hummed at regular inter-, 
vals through the room. Nature and Madame Dor had Com- 
bined together in Vendale’ s interests. The best of women 
was asleep. ; 

Marguerite rose to stop — not the snoring — let us say, the 
audible repose of Madame Dor. Vendale laid his hand on 
her arm, and pressed her back gently into her chair. 

“Don’t disturb her,” he whispered “I have been wait- 
ing to tell you a secret. Let me tell it now.” 

Marguerite resumed her seat* She tried to resume her 
needle. It was useless; her eyes failed, her; her hand 
failed her; she could find nothing. 

“ We have been talking,” said Vendale, “ of the happy 
time when we first met, and first travelled together. I 
have a confession to make. . I have been concealing some- 
thing. When we spoke of my first visit to Switzerland, I 
told you of all the impressions I had brought back with m© 
to England — except one. Can you guess what that one 
is? ” 

Her eyes looked steadfastly at the embroidery, and he* 
face turned a little away from him. Signs of disturbance 
began to appear in her neat velvet bodice, round the region 
of the brooch. She made no reply. Vendale pressed the 
question without mercy. ! • 

“Can you guess what the one Swiss impression is, 

I have not told: you yet?” * » . .»■

Her face turned back towards him, and a faint smile 
trembled on her lips. 

“ An impression of the mountains, perhaps?” she said, 
slily. 

“No; a much more precious impression than that.” 

“Of the lakes? ” 

“ No. The lakes have not grown dearer and dearer in 
remembrance to me every day. The lakes are not associ- 
ated with my happiness in the present, and my hopes in 
the future. Marguerite! all that makes life worth having 
hangs, for me, on a word from your lips. Marguerite ! I 
love you ! ” 

Her head dropped, as he took her hand. He drew her to 
him, and looked at her. The tears escaped from her down- 
cast eyes, and fell slowly over her cheeks. 

“Oh, Mr. Vendale,” she said, sadly, “it would have been 
kinder to have kept your secret. Have you forgotten the 
distance between us? It can never, never, be ! ” 

“ There can be but one distance between us, Marguerite 
— a distance of your making. My love, my darling, there 
is no higher rank in goodness, there is no higher rank in 
beauty, than yotirs! Come! whisper the one little word 
which tells me you will be my wife ! ” 

She sighed bitterly. “Think of your family,” she mur- 
mured; “ and think of mine ! ” 

Vendale drew her a little nearer to him. 

“If you dwell on such an obstacle as that,” he said, “I 
shall think but one thought — I shall think I have offended 
you.” 

She started, and looked up. “Oh, no!” she exclaimed, 
innocently. The instant the words passed her lips, she 
saw the construction that might be placed on them. Her 
confession had escaped her in spite of herself. A lovely 
flush of colour overspread her face. She made a moment- 
ary effort to disengage herself from her lover’s embrace. 
She looked up at him entreatingly. She tried to speak. 
The words died on her lips in the kiss that Vendale pressed 
on them. “Let me go, Mr. Vendale! ” she said, faintly. 

“Call me George.” 

She laid her head on his bosom. All her heart went out 
to him at last. “ George ! ” she whispered. 

“ Say you love me ! ” 

Her arms twined themselves gently round his neck. Her

lips, timidly touching his cheek, murmured the delicious 
words — “ I love you ! ” 

In the moment of silence that followed, the sound of the 
opening and closing of the house-door came clear to them 
through the wintry stillness of the street. 

Marguerite started to her feet. 

“ Let me go ! ” she said. “ He has come back ! ” 

She hurried from the room, and touched Madame Dor's 
shoulder in passing. Madame Dor woke up with a loud 
snort, looked first over one shoulder and then over the 
other, peered down into her lap, and discovered neither 
stockings, worsted, nor darning-needle in it. At the same 
moment, footsteps became audible ascending the stairs. 
“ Mon Dieu ! ” said Madame Dor, addressing herself to the 
stove, and trembling violently. Vendale picked up the 
stockings and the ball, and huddled them all back in a heap 
over her shoulder. “ Mon Dieu ! ” said Madame Dor, for 
the second time, as the avalanche of worsted poured into 
her capacious lap. 

The door opened, and Obenreizer came in. His first 
glance round the room showed him that Marguerite was ab- 
sent. 

" What! ” he exclaimed, “my niece is away? My niece 
ip not here to entertain you in my absence? This is un- 
pardonable. I shall bring her back instantly.” 

Vendale stopped him. 

“I beg you will not disturb Miss Obenreizer,'? he said- 
u You have returned, I see, without your friend? ” 

“ My friend remains, and consoles our afflicted compa- 
triot. A heart-rending scene, Mr* Vendale! The , house- 
hold gods at the pawnbroker's — the family immersed in 
tears. We all embraced in- silence. My admirable friend 
alone possessed his composure. He sent out, on the spot, 
for a bottle of wine.” 

“ Can I say a word to you in private, Mr. Obenreizer? ” 

“ Assuredly.” He turned to Madame Dor. “My good 
creature, you are sinking for want of repose. Mr. Vendale 
will excuse you.” 

Madame Dor rose, and set forth sideways on her journey 
from the stove to bed. She dropped a stocking.- , Vendale 
picked it up for her, and opened one of the folding-doors* 
She advanced a step, attd dropped three more stockings.

terfered with profuse apologies, and with a warning look at 
Madame Dor. Madame Dor acknowledged the look by 
dropping the whole of the stockings in a heap, and then 
shuffling away panic-stricken from the scene of disaster. 
Obenreizer swept up the complete collection fiercely in both 
hands. “ Go ! ” he cried, giving his prodigious handful a 
preparatory swing in the air. Madame Dor said, “Mon 
Dieu,” and vanished into the next room, pursued by a 
shower of stockings. 

“ What must you think, Mr. Vendale,” said Obenreizer, 
closing the door, “ of this deplorable intrusion of domestic 
details? For myself, I blush at it. We are beg inning the 
New Year as badly as possible; everything has gone wrong 
to-night. Be seated, pray — and say, what may I offer 
you? Shall we pay our best respects to another of your 
noble English institutions? It is my study to be, what 
you call, jolly. I propose a grog.” 

Vendale declined the grog with all needful respect for 
that noble institution. 

u I wish to speak to you on a subject in which I am 
deeply interested,” he said. “You must have observed, 
Mr. Obenreizer, that I have, from the first, felt no ordi- 
nary admiration for your charming niece? ” 

“ You are very good. In my niece’s name, I thank yon.” 

“ Perhaps you may have noticed, latterly, that my ad- 
miration for Miss Obenreizer has grown into a tenderer and 
deeper feeling ? ” 

“Shall we say friendship, Mr. Vendale?” 

“Say love — and we shall be nearer to the truth.” 

Obenreizer started out of his chair. The faintly discern- 
ible beat, which was his nearest approach to a change of 
colour, showed itself suddenly in his cheeks. 

“ You are Miss Obenreizer ’s guardian,” pursued Vendale. 
“ I ask you to confer upon me the greatest of all favours — 
I ask you to give me her hand in marriage.” 

Obenreizer dropped back into his chair. “ Mr. Vendale,” 
he said, “you petrify me.” 

“I will wait,” rejoined Vendale, “until you have recov- 
ered yourself.” 

“ One word before I recover myself. You have said noth- 
ing about this to my niece? ” 

“I have opened my whole heart to your niece. And* I 
have reason to hope—”

“What!” interposed Obenreizer. “You have made a 
proposal to my niece, without first asking for ,my authority 
to pay your addresses to her? ” He struck his hand on the 
table, and lost his hold over himself for the first time in 
Yendale’ s experience of him. “Sir!” he exclaimed, in- 
dignantly, “ what sort of conduct is this? As a man of 
honour, speaking to a man of honour, how can you justify 
it? ” 

“I can only justify it as one of our English institutions,” 
said Yendale, quietly. “ You admire our English institu- 
tions. I can’t honestly tell you, Mr. Obenreizer, that I 
regret what I have done. I can only assure you that I 
have not acted in the matter with any intentional disre- 
spect towards yourself. This said, may I ask you to tell 
me plainly what objection you see to favouring my suit? ” 

“I see this immense objection,” answered Obenreizer, 
“ that my niece and you are not on a social equality to- 
gether. My niece is the daughter of a poor peasant; and 
you are the son of a gentleman. You do us an honour,” he 
added, lowering himself again gradually to his customary 
polite level, “ which deserves, and has, our most grateful 
acknowledgments. But the inequality is too glaring; the 
sacrifice is too great. You English are a proud people, 
Mr. Vendale. I have observed enough of this country to 
see that such a marriage as you propose would be a scandal 
here. Not a hand would be held out to your peasant- wife; 
and all your best friends would desert you.” 

“One moment/’ said Yendale, interposing on his side. 
“ I may claim, without any great arrogance, to know more 
of my country-people in general, and of nay own friends in 
particular, than you do. In the estimation of everybody 
whose opinion is worth having, my wife herself would be 
the one sufficient justification of my marriage. If I did 
not feel certain — observe, I say certain — that I am offering 
her a position which she can accept without so much as the 
shadow of a humiliation — I would, never (cost me what it 
might) have asked her to be my wife. Is there any other 
obstacle that you see? Have you any personal objection 
to me? ” 

Obenreizer spread out both his hands in courteous pro- 
test. “Personal objection!” he exclaimed. “Dear sir, 
the bare question is painful to me.” 

“We. are both men of business,” pursued Yend r

you naturally expect me to satisfy you that I have the 
means of supporting a wife. I can explain my pecuniary 
position in two words. I inherit from my parents a for- 
tune of twenty thousand pounds. In half of that sum I 
have only a life-interest, to which, if I die, leaving a 
widow, my widow succeeds. If I die, leaving children, 
the money itself is divided among them, as they come of 
age. The other half of my fortune is at my own disposal, 
and is invested in the wine-business. I see my way to 
greatly improving that business. As it stands at present, 
I cannot state my return from my capital embarked at 
more than twelve hundred a year. Add the yearly value 
of my life-interest — and the total reaches a present annual 
income of fifteen hundred pounds. I have the fairest pros- 
pect of soon making it more. In the mean time, do you 
object to me on pecuniary grounds? ” 

Driven back to his last entrenchment, Obenreizer rose, 
and took a turn backwards and forwards in the room. For 
the moment, he was plainly at a loss what to say or do 
next. 

“ Before I answer that last question,” he said, after a 
little close consideration with himself, 44 1 beg leave to re- 
vert for a moment to Miss Marguerite. You said some- 
thing just now which seemed to imply that she returns the 
sentiment with which you are pleased to regard her? ” 

44 1 have the inestimable happiness,” said Vend ale, 44 of 
knowing that she loves me.” 

Obenreizer stood silent for a moment, with the film over 
his eyes, and the faintly perceptible beat becoming visible 
again in his cheeks. 

44 If you will excuse me for a few minutes,” he said, with 
ceremonious politeness, 44 1 should like to have the oppor- 
tunity of speaking to my niece.” With those words, he 
bowed, and quitted the room. 

Left by himself, Veridale J s thoughts (as a necessary re- 
sult of the interview, thus far) turned instinctively to the 
consideration of Obenreizer* s motives. He had put ob- 
stacles in the way of the * courtship; he was now putting 
obstacles in the way of the marriage — a marriage offering 
advantages which even his ingenuity could not dispute. 
On the face of it, his conduct was 1 incomprehensible. 
What did it mean?

riom— and remembering that Ohenreizer w^s a man of about 
his own age; also, that Marguerite was, strictly speaking, 
his half-niece only ^Vendale asked himself, with a lover’s 
ready jealousy, whether he had a rival to fear, as well as a 
guardian to conciliate. The thought just crossed his mind, 
and no more. The sense of Marguerite's bias still lingering 
on his cheek reminded him gently that even, the, jealousy of 
a moment was npw a treason to her , 

On refection, it seemed ™»t hfely that a personal mo 
tive of another Jfind might suggest the true explanation of 
Obenreizer’s conduct. Marguerite’s grace and beauty were 
precious ornaments in that little household,. They gave it a 
special social attraction and a special social importance. 
They armed Qfenreizev with a certain influence in reserve, 
w.hieh fe could always depend upon to make his house at- 
tractive, and which he might always bring more pr less to 
bear on the forwarding of his own private ends. Was he 
the sort of man to resign such advantages as were here im- 
plied, without obtaining, the fiuUost possible compensation 
for the loss? A connection by marriage with Vendale 
offered him solid advantages, beyond all doubt. But there 
were hundreds of men in London with far greater power 
and far wider influence than Vendale possessed, Was it 
possible that this man’s ambition secretly looked higher 
than the highest prospects that could be offered to him by 
the alliance now proposed for, his niece? As the question 
passed through Vendafe’s mind, the man himself (reap- 
peared to answer it* or not tp answer it* as the event might 
prove, : . 

A marked change was visible ; in Obenreizer when ho re* 
sumed his place. #is manner was lass assured, and tfeie 
were plain traces about his month of recent agitation which 
had not been successfully composed. Ifad he said some-

the first tfee, Aace to face with a refute assertion of his 
niece’s wijll? Jib might pr, might not be. This only was 
certain— he looked life a nmo who had met with a repulse, 

“I have spoken to my niece,” he begun. “I find, Mr* 
Vendale, that *even ^our influence has not entirely blinded 
her to the social objections to your proposal.” 

“ May f ask,” returned Vendale, “if that is tbepnlyapp 
pult of your iuferyiejv with QbjsureWF?” /

A momentary flash leapt out through the Obenreizer film. 

“You are master of the situation,” he answered, in a 
tone of sardonic submission. “ If you insist on my admit- 
ting it, I do admit it in those words. My niece’s will and 
mine used to be one, Mr. Yendale. You have come be- 
tween us, and her will is now yours. In my country, we 
know when we are beaten, and we Submit with our best 
grace. I submit, with my best grace, on certain condi- 
tions. Let us revert to the statement of your pecuniary 
position. I have an objection to you, my dear sir — a most 
amazing, a most audacious objection, from a man in my 
position to a man in yours.” 

“ What is it? ” 

“ You have honoured me by making a proposal for my 
niece’s hand. For the present (with best thanks and Te~ 
spects), I beg to decline it.” 

“ Why? ” 

“ Because you are not rich enough.” 

The objection, as the speaker had foreseen, took Vendale 
completely by surprise. For the moment he was speechless. 

“ Your income is fifteen hundred a year,” pursued Oben- 
reizer. “ In my miserable country I should fall on my 
knees before your income, and say, 1 What a princely for- 
tune ! * In wealthy England, I sit as I am, and say, ‘ A 
modest independence, dear sir; nothing more. Enough, 
perhaps, for a wife in your own rank of life, who had no 
social prejudices to conquer. Not more than half enough 
for a wife who is a meanly born foreigner, and who has all 
your social prejudices against her.* Sirl if my niece is 
ever to marry you, she will have what you call uphill work 
of it in taking her place at starting. Yes, yes; this is not 
your view, but it reihains, immovably remains, my view 
for all that. For my niece's sake, I claim that this uphill 
Work shall be made as smodth as possible. Whatever ma- 
terial advantages she can have to help her, ought, in com- 
mon justice, to be hers. Now, tell me, Mr. Yendale, on 
your fifteen hundred a year can your wife have a house in a 
fashionable quarter, a footman to open her door, a butler to 
wait at her table, and a carriage and horses to drive about 
in? I see the answer in your face — your face says, No. 
Yery good. Tell me one more thing, and I have done. 
Take the mass of your educated, accomplished, and lovely 
countrywomen, is it, or is it not, the fact that a lady who

has a house in a fashionable quarter, a footman to open her 
door, a butler to wait at her table, and a carriage and horses 
to drive about in, is a lady who has gained four steps, in 
female estimation, at starting? Yes? or No? ” 

“Come to the point,” said Vendale. “You view this 
question as a question of terms. What are your terms? ” 

“The lowest terms, dear sir, on which you can provide 
your wife with those four steps at starting. Double your 
present income4-the most rigid economy cannot do it in 
England on less. You said just now. that you expected 
greatly to increase the value of your business. To work— 
and increase it! ■ I am a good devil after all! On the day 
when ygu satisfy me, by plain proofs, that your income has 
risen to three thousand a year, ask me for my niece’s hand, 
and it is yours.” 

“ May I inquire if you have mentioned this arrangement 
to Miss Obenreizer? ” , 

“Certainly. She has a last little morsel of regard still 
left for me, Mr. Vendale, which is not yours yet; and she 
accepts my terms. In other words, she submits to be 
guided by her guardian’s regard for her welfare, and by 
her guardian’s superior knowledge of the world.” He 
threw himself back in his chair, iu firm reliance on his 
position, and in full possession of his excellent temper. 

Any open assertion of his own interests, in the situation 
in which Vendale was now- placed, seemed to be (for the 
present at least) hopeless. He found himself literally left 
with no ground to stand on. Whether Obenreizer’ a objec- 
tions were the genuine product of Obenreizer’s own view of 
the case, or whether, he was simply delaying the- marriage 
in the hope of ultimately breaking it off altogether — in 
either of these events, any present resistance on Vendale’ s 
part would be equally useless. There- was no help for it 
but to yield, making the best terms that he could on his 
own side. 

“I protest against the conditions you impose on me,” he 
began. 

“Naturally,” said Obenreizer; “I dare say I should pro- 
test, myself, in your place.” 

“Say, however,” pursued Vendale,' “that I accept your 
terms. In that case, I must be permitted to make two 
stipulations on my part. In the first place, I shall 
to be allowed to see your niece,”

** Aha! to see m y niece? and to make her in as great a 
hurry to be married as you are yourself? Suppose I say, 
No? you would see her perhaps without my permission? ” 

“Decidedly ! ** 

“How delightfully frank! How exquisitely English! 
You shall see her, Mr. Vendale, on certain days, which we 
will appoint together. What next? ” 

“ Your objection to my income,” proceeded Yendale, “ has 
taken me completely by surprise. I wish to be assured 
against any repetition of that surprise. Your present 
views of my qualification for marriage require me to have 
an income of three thousand a year. Can I be certain, in 
the future, as your experience of England enlarges, that 
your estimate will rise no higher? ” 

“In plain English,” said Obenreizer, “you doubt my 
word ? 99 

“ Do you purpose to take my word for it when I inform 
you that I have doubled my income? 99 asked Vendale. “ If 
my memory does not deceive me, you stipulated, a minute 
since, for plain proofs? ” 

“Well played, Mr. Vendale! You combine the foreign 
quickness with the English solidity. Accept my best con- 
gratulations. Accept, also, iny written guarantee.” 

He rose; seated himself at a writing-desk at a side- table, 
wrote a few lines, and presented them to Vendale with i* 
low bow. The engagement was perfectly explicit, and was 
signed and dated with scrupulous care. 

“ Are you satisfied with your guarantee ? 99 

“ I am satisfied.” 

“ Charmed to hear it, I am sure. We have had our little 
skirmish — we have really been wonderfully clever on both 
sides. For the present our affairs are settled. I bear no 
malice. You bear no malice. Come, Mr. Vendale, a good 
English shake hands.” 

Vendale gave his hand, a little bewildered by Obenrei- 
zer’a sudden transitions from one humour to another. 

“ When may I expect to see Miss Obenreizer again ? 99 he 
asked, as he rose to go* 

“Honour me with a visit to-morrow,” said Obenreizer, 
“ and we will Settle it then. Do have a grog before you 
go! No? Well! well! wC will reserve the grog till you 
have your thfee thousand a year, and are ready to be man 
ried. Aha! When will that be? ”

“ I made an estimate, some months since, of the eapae* 
ities of my business,” said Vendale. “If that estimate is 
correct, I shall double my present income ” 

“ And be married ! ” added Obenreizer. 

“And be married,” repeated Vendale, ^within a year 
from this time. Good night.” 

VENDALE MAKES MISCHIEF. 

When Vendale entered his office the next morning, the 
dull commercial routine at Cripple Corner met him with a 
new face. Marguerite had an interest in it now! * The 
whole machinery which Wilding’s death had set in motion, 
to realise the yalue of the business— the balancing of ledg- 
ers, the estimating of debts, the taking of stock, and the 
rest of it — was now transformed into machinery which indi- 
cated the chanties for and against a speedy marriage; 
After looking over results, as presented by his aocountant, 
and checking additions and subtractions, as rendered by 
the clerks, Vendale turned his attention to the stock-taking 
department next, and sent a message to the cellars,* desir- 
ing to see the report. • 1 

The Cellarman’s appearance, the moment he put his head 
in at the door of his master’s private room, suggested that 
something very extraordinary must have happened that 
morning. There was an approach to alacrity in Joey 
Ladle’s movements l There was something which actually 
simulated cheerfulness in Joey Ladle’s face! 

“What’s the matte jr?” asked Vendale. “Anything 
wrong?” 

“I should wish to inention one thing,” answered Joey. 
“ Young Mr. Vendale, I have never- set myself up for a 
prophet.” 

“ Who ever said you did? ” 

“ No prophet, as far as I’ve heard tell of that profession,” 
proceeded Joey, “ever lived principally underground. No 
prophet, whatever else he might take in at the pores, ever 
took in wine from morning to night, for a number of years 
together. When I said to young Master Wilding, respect4 
ing his changing the, name of the firm, that one of these 
days he might find he’d changed the luck of the firm-^did

of Pebbleson Nephew, Young Mr. Vendale, no such thing 
was ever known as a mistake made in a consignment deliv- 
ered at these doors. There’s a mistake been made now. 
Please to remark that it happened before Miss Margaret 
came here. For which reason it don’t go against what I’ve 
said respecting Miss Margaret singing ’ round the luck. 
Read that, sir,” concluded Joey, pointing attention to a 
special passage in the report, with a forefinger which ap- 
peared to be in process of taking in through the pores noth- 
ing more remarkable than dirt. e( It’s foreign to my nature 
to crow over the house I serve, but I feel it a kind of a sol- 
emn duty to ask you to read that.” 

Vendale read as follows: “Note, respecting the Swiss 
champagne. An irregularity has been discovered in the 
last consignment received from the firm of Defresnier and 
Co.” Vendale stopped, and referred to a memorandum- 
book by his side. “That was in Mr. Wilding’s time,” he 
said. “The vintage was a particularly good one, and he 
took the whole of it. The Swiss champagne has done very 
well, hasn’t it?” 

“ I don’t say it’s done badly,” answered the Cellarman. 
“ It may have got sick in our customers’ bins, or it may 
have bust in our customers’ hands. But I don’t say it’s 
done badly with usS’ 

Vendale resumed the reading of the note: “We find the 
number of the cases to be quite correct by the books. But 
six of them, which present a slight difference from the rest 
in the brand, have been opened, and have been found to 
contain a red wine instead of champagne. The similarity 
in the brands, we suppose, caused a mistake to be made in 
sending the consignment from Neuchfitel. The error has 
not been found to extend beyond six cases.” 

“ Is that all ! ” exclaimed Vendale, tossing the note away 
from him. 

. Joey Ladle’s eye followed the flying morsel of paper 
drearily. 

“ I’m glad to see you take it easy, sir,” he said. “ What- 
ever happens, it will be always a comfort to you to remem- 
ber that you took it easy at first. Sometimes one mistake 
leads to another. A man drops a bit of orange-peel on the 
pavement by mistake, and another man treads on it by mis- 
take, and there’s a job at the hospital, and a party crippled 
for life. I’m glad you take it easyy sir.’ In Pebbleson

Nephew’s time we shouldn’t have taken it easy till we bad 
seen the end of it. Without desiring to crow over the 
house, Young Mr. Vendale, I wish you well through it. 
No offence, sir,” said the. Cellarman, opening the door to 
go out, and looking in again ominously before he shut it. 
“ I’m muddled and molloncolly, I grant you. But I’m an 
old servant of Pebbleson Nephew, and I wish you well 
through them six cases of red wine.” 

Left by himself, Venaale laughed, and took up his pen. 
“I may as well send a line to Defresnier and Company,” 
he thought, “ before I forget it.” He wrote at once in 
these terms : 

“ Dear Sirs. We are taking stock, and a trifling mistake 
has been discovered in the last consignment of champagne 
sent by your house to ours. Six of the cases contain red 
wine — which we hereby return to you. The matter can 
easily be set right, either by your sending us six cases of 
the champagne, if they can be produced, or, if not, by your 
crediting us with the value of six cases on the amount last 
paid (five hundred pounds) by our firm to yours. Your 
faithful servants, . Wilding and Co.” 

This letter despatched to the post, the subject dropped 
at once out of Vendale ’s mind. He had other and far more 
interesting matters to think of. Later in the day he paid 
the visit to Obenreizer which had been agreed on between 
them. Certain evenings in the week were set apart which 
he was privileged to spend with Marguerite — always, how- 
ever, in the presence of a third person. On this stipulation 
Obenreizer politely but positively insisted. The one con- 
cession he made was to give Vendale his choice of who the 
third person should be. Confiding in past experience, his 
choice fell unhesitatingly upon the excellent woman who 
mended Obenreizer’ s stockings. On hearing of the respon- 
sibility entrusted to her, Madame Dor’s intellectual nature 
burst suddenly into a new stage of development. She 
waited till Obenreizer’s eye was off her — and then she 
looked at Vendale and dimly winked. 

The time passed — the happy evefflngs with Marguerite 
came and went. It was the tenth morning since Vendale 
had written to the Swiss firm, when the answer appeared 
on his desk, with the other letters of the day :

*Dear Sirs. We beg to offer oar excuses for the littk 
mistake which has happened. At the same time, we regret 
to add that the statement of Our error, with which you have 
favoured us, has led to a very unexpected discovery. The 
affair is a most serious one for you and for us. The par- 
ticulars are as follows : 

“ Having no more champagne of the vintage last sent to 
you, we made arrangements to credit your firm with the 
value of the six cases, as suggested bv yourself. On tak- 
ing this step, certain forms observed m our mode of doing 
business necessitated a reference to our bankers’ book, as 
well as to our ledger. The result is a moral certainty that 
no such remittance as you mention can have reached our 
house, and a literal certainty that no such remittance has 
been paid to out account at the bank. 

“ It is needless, at this stage of the proceedings, to 
trouble you with details. The money has unquestionably 
been stolen in the course of its transit from you to us. Cer- 
tain peculiarities which we observe, relating to the manner 
in which the fraud has been perpetrated, lead ns to con- 
clude that the thief may have calculated on being able to 
pay the missing sum to our bankers, before an inevitable 
discovery followed the annual striking of our balance. 
This Would not have happened, in the nsual course* for an- 
other three months. During that period, but for your let- 
ter, we might have remained perfectly unconscious of the 
robbery that has been committed. 

“ We mention this last circumstance, as it may help to 
show you that we have to do, in this case, with no ordinary 
thief. Thus far We have not even a suspicion of who that 
thief is. B\lt we believe you will assist us in making some 
advance towards discovery, by examining the receipt 
(forged, of course) which has no doubt purported to come 
to you from our house. Be pleased to look and see whether 
it is a receipt entirely in manuscript, or whether it is a num- 
bered and printed form tvliich merely requires the tilling in 
of the amount. The settlement of this apparently trivial 
question is, we assure you, a matter of vital importance. 
Anxiously awaiting your reply, we remain, with high es- 
teem and consideration,

to steady his mind under the shock that had fallen on it. 
At the time of all others ^rhen it was most important to 
him to increase the value of his business, that business was 
threatened with a loss of five hundred pounds. He thought 
of Marguerite, as he took the key from his pocket and opened 
the iron chamber in the wall in which the books and papers 
of the firm were kept. 

He was still in the chamber, searching for the forged 
receipt, when he was startled by a voice speaking close be- 
hind him. 

“A thousand pardons,” said the voice; f ‘I am afraid I 
disturb you.*' 

He turned, and found himself face to face with Margue- 
rite's guardian. 

“I have called,” pursued Obenreizer, “to know if I can 
be of any use. Business of my own takes me away for 
some days to Manchester and Liverpool. Can I combine 
any business of yours with it? I am entirely at your dis- 
posal, in the character of commercial traveller for the firm 
of Wilding and Co.” 

“Excuse me for one moment,” said Vendale; ^1 will 
speak to you directly.” He turned round again, and con- 
tinued his search among the papers. “ You come at a time 
when friendly offers are more than usually precious to me,” 
he resumed. “I have had very bad news this morning 
from Neuch&teL” 

“ Bad news ! ” exclaimed Obenreizer. “ From Defresnier 
and Company? '* 

“ Yes. A remittance we sent to them has been stolen. 
I am threatened with a loss of five hundred pounds. 
What's that? ” 

Turning sharply, and looking into the room for the sec- 
ond time, Vendale discovered his envelope-case overthrown 
on the floor, and Obenreizer on his knees picking up the 
contents 

“ All my awkwardness ! ” said Obenreizer. . “ This dread- 
ful news of yours startled me; I stepped back — — ” He 
became too deeply interested in collecting the scattered en- 
velopes to finish the sentence. 

“Don't trouble yourself,” said Vendale. “The clerk 
will pick the things up.” 

“This dreadful news!” repeated Obenreizer, persisting 
in collecting the envelopes. “ This dreadfpl news 1 ”

“If you will read the letter,” said Vendale, “you will 
find I have exaggerated nothing There it is, open on my 
desk.” 

He resumed his search, and in a moment more discovered 
the forged receipt. It was on the numbered and printed 
form, described by the Swiss firm. Vendale made a mem- 
orandum of the number and the date. Having replaced 
the receipt and locked up the iron chamber, he had leisure 
to notice Obenreizer, reading the letter in the recess of a 
window at the far end of the room. 

• “Come to the fire,” said Vendale. M You look perished 
with the cold out there. I will ring for some more ooalB.” 

Obenreizer rose, and came slowly baok to the desk. 
“Marguerite will be as sorry to hear of this as I am,” he 
said, kindly. “ What do you mean to do? ” 

“I am in the hands of Defresnier and Company,” an- 
swered Vendale. “ In my total ignorance of the circum-, 
stances, I can only do what they recommend. The receipt 
which I have just found, turns out to be the numbered and 
printed form. They seem to attach some special impor- 
tance to its discovery. You have had experience, when 
you were in the Swiss house, of their way of doing busi- 
ness. Can you guess what object they have in view? ” 
Obenreizer offered a suggestion. 

“ Suppose I examine the receipt? ” he said. 

“Are you ill? ” asked Vendale, startled by the change in 
his face, which now showed itself plainly for the first time. 
“ Pray go to the fire. You seem to be shivering; — I hope 
you are not going to be ill? ” 

“Not I!” said Obenreizer. “Perhaps I have caught 
cold. Your English climate might have spared an admirer 
of your English institutions. Let me look at the receipt.” 

Vendale opened the iron chamber. Obenreizer took a 
chair, and drew it close to the fire^ He held both hands 
over the flames. “Let me look at the receipt,” he re- 
peated, eagerly, as Vendale reappeared with the paper in 
his hand. At the same moment a porter entered the room 
with a fresh supply of coals. Vendale told him to make a 
good fire. The man obeyed the order with a disastrous 
alacrity. As he stepped forward and raised the scuttle, 
his foot caught in a fold of the rug, and he discharged his 
enfcife cargo of coals into the grate. The result was an in- 
stant smothering of the flame, and the production of a

stream of yellow smoke, without a visible morsel of fire 
to account for it. 

“ Imbecile ! ” whispered Obenreizer to himself, with a 
look at the man which the man remembered for many a 
long day afterwards. 

“ Will you come into the clerks’ room ? 99 asked Vendale. 
“ They have a stove there.” 

“No, no. No matter.” 

Vendale handed him the receipt. Obenreizer’ s interest 
in examining it appeared to have been quenched as sud-. 
denly and as effectually as the fire itself. He just glanced 
over the document, and said, “No; I don’t understand it! 
I am sorry to be of no use.” 

“I will write to Neuchatel by to-night’s post,” said Ven- 
dale, putting away the receipt for the second time. “We 
must wait, and see what comes of it.” 

“By to-night’s post,” repeated Obenreizer. “ Let me 
see. You will get the answer in eight or nine days’ time. 
I shall be back before. that. If I can be of any, service, as 
commercial traveller, perhaps you will let me know between 
this and then. You will , send me written instructions? 
My best thanks. I shall be most anxious for your answer 
from Neuchatel. Who knows? It may be a mistake,; my 
dear friend, after all. Courage! courage! courage!” He 
had entered the room with no appearance of being pressed 
for time. He now snatched up his hat, and took his leave 
with the air of a man who had not another moment to 
lose. 

Left by himself, Vendale took a turn thoughtfully in the 
room. 

His previous impression of Obenreizer was shaken by 
what he had heard and seen at the interview which had 
just taken place. He was disposed, for the first time, to 
doubt whether, in this case, he had not been a little hasty 
and hard in his judgment .on another man. Obenreizer’s 
surprise and regret, on hearing the news from Neuch&tel, 
bore the plainest marks of being honestly felt — not politely 
assumed for the occasion. With troubles of his own to en- 
counter, suffering, to: all appearance, from the first insidious 
attack of a serious illness, he had looked and spoken likei 
a man who really deplored the disaster that had fallen on 
his friend. Hitherto, Vendale had tried vainly to alter hi% 
first opinion of Marguerite’s guardian, for Marguerite’s

re 

Safe. All the generous instincts in his nature now com- 
bined together and shook the evidence which had seemed 
unanswerable up to this time. “ Who knows? ” he 
thought, “ I may have read that man’s face wrongly, after 
all.” 

The time passed— the happy evenings with Marguerite 
came and went. It was again the tenth morning since 
Vendale had written to the Swiss firm; and again the an- 
swer appeared on his desk with the other letters of the 
day. 

“ Dear Sir. My senior partner, M. Defresnier, has been 
called away, by urgent business, to Milan. In his absence 
(and with his full concurrence and authority), I now write 
you again on the subject of the missing live hundred 
pounds. 

“ Your discovery that the forged receipt is executed upon 
one of our numbered and printed forms has caused inex- 
pressible surprise and distress to my partner and to myself. 
At the time when your remittance was stolen, but three 
keys were in existence opening the strong box in which our 
receipt-forms are invariably kept. My partner had one 
key; I had the other. The third was in the possession 
of a gentleman who, at that period, occupied a position of 
trust in our house. We should as soon have thought of 
suspecting one of ourselves ah of suspecting this person. 
Suspicion now points at him, nevertheless. I cannot pre- 
vail on myself to inform you who the person is, so long as 
there i$ the shadow of a chance that he may come inno- 
cently out of the inquiry which must now be instituted. 
Forgive my silence; the motive of it is good. 

“ The form our investigation must now taka is simple 
enough. The handwriting on your receipt must be com- 
pared, by competent persons whom we have at our dis- 
posal, with Certain specimens of handwriting in our pos- 
session. I cannot send you the specimens, for business 
reasons, which, when you hear them, you are sure to ap- 
prove. I must beg you to send me the receipt to Neu- 
eh&tel — and, in making this request, I must accompany it 
by a word of necessary warning. 

“If the person, at whom suspicion now points, really 
proves to be the person who has committed this forgery 
anud theft, 1 have reason to fear that Circumstances may

have already put him on his guard. The only evidence 
against him is the evidence in your hands, and he will 
move heaven and earth to obtain and destroy it. I 
strongly urge you not to trust the receipt to the post. 
Send it to me, without loss of time, by a private hand, and 
choose nolK)dy for your messenger but a person long estab- 
lished in your own employment, accustomed to travelling, 
capable of speaking French; a man of courage, a man of 
honesty, and, above all things, a man who can be trusted 
to let no stranger scrape acquaintance with him on the 
route. Tell no one — absolutely no one— but your messen- 
ger of the turn this matter has now taken. The safe 
transit of the receipt may depend on your interpreting 
literally the advice which I give you at the end of this 
letter. 

“ I have only to add that every possible saving of time is 
now of the last importance. More than one of our receipt- 
forms is missing — and it is impossible to say what new 
frauds may not be committed, if we fail to lay our hands 
on the thief. 

“ Your faithful servant, 

“ Holland, 

“(Signing for Defresnier & C 16 ).” • 

Who was the suspected man? , In Vendale’s position, it 
seemed useless to inquire. 

Who was to be sent to Neucji&tel with the receipt? Men 
of courage and men of honesty were to be had at Cripple 
Comer for the asking, But where was the man who was 
accustomed to foreign travelling, who could speak the 
French language, and who could be really relied on to let 
no stranger scrape acquaintance with him on his route? 
There was but one man at hand who combined all those 
requisites in his own person, and that man was Vendale 
himself. 

It was a sacrifice to leave his business; it was a greater 
sacrifice to leave Marguerite. But a matter of five hundred 
pounds was involved in the pending inquiry; and a literal 
interpretation of M. Holland’s advice was insisted on in 
terms which there was no trifling with. The more Vendale 
thought of it, the more plainly the necessity faced him, and 
said, “ Go ! ” 

As he looked up the letter with the receipt, the

ation of ideas reminded him of Obenreizer. A guess at the 
identity of the suspected man looked more possible now. 
Obenreizer might know. 

The thought had barely passed through his mind, when 
the door opened, and Obenreizer entered the room. 

“ They told me at Soho-square you were expected back 
last night,” said Vendale, greeting him. “ Have you done 
well in the country? Are you better? ” 

A thousand thanks. Obenreizer had done admirably 
well; Obenreizer was infinitely better. And now, what 
news? Any letter from Neuch&tel? 

“ A very strange letter,” answered Vendale. “ The mat- 
ter has taken a new turn, and the letter insists — without 
excepting anybody — on my keeping our next proceedings a 
profound secret.” 

“ Without excepting anybody? ” repeated Obenreizer. 
As he said the words, he walked away again, thought- 
fully, to the window at the other end of the room, looked 
out for a moment, and suddenly came back to Vendale. 
“ Surely they must have forgotten? ” he resumed, “ or they 
would have excepted me ? 99 

“It is Monsieur Holland who writes,” said Vendale. 
“And, as you say, he must certainly have forgotten. 
That view of the matter quite escaped me. I was just 
wishing I had you to consult, when you came into the 
room. And here I am tied by a formal prohibition, which 
cannot possibly have been intended to include you. How 
very annoying!” ' 

Obenreizer’ s filmy eyes fixed on Vendale attentively. 

“ Perhaps it is more than annoying ! ” he said. “ I came 
this morning not only to hear the news, but to offer myself 
as messenger; negotiator — what you will. Would you be- 
lieve it? I have letters which oblige me to go to Switzer- 
land immediately. Messages, documents, anything — I 
could have taken them all to Defresnier and Holland for 


you.” 

“You are the very man I wanted,” returned Vendale. 
“I had decided, most unwillingly, on going to Neuch&tel 
myself, not five minutes since, because I could find no one 
here capable of taking my place. Let me look at the letter 
again.” 

He opened the strong room to get at the letter. Oben- 
reizer, after first glancing round him to make quite -sure

that they were alone, followed a step or two and waited, 
measuring Vendale with his eye. Vendale was the tallest 
man, and unmistakably the strongest man also of the two.. 
Obenreizer turned away, and warmed himself at the fire. 

Meanwhile, Vendale read the last paragraph in the letter 
for the third time. There was the plain warning — there 
was the closing sentence, which insisted on a literal inter- 
pretation of it. The hand, which was leading Vendale in 
the dark, led him on that condition only. A large stun 
was at stake : a terrible suspicion remained to be verified. 
If he acted on his own responsibility, and if anything hap- 
pened to defeat the object in view, who would be blamed? 
As a man of business, Vendale had but one course to fol- 
low. He locked the letter up again. 

“It is most annoying,” he said to Obenreizer — “it is a 
piece of forgetfulness on Monsieur Holland’s part which 
puts me to serious inconvenience, and places me in an ab- 
surdly false position towards you. What am I to do? I 
am acting in a very serious matter, and acting entirely in 
the dark. I have no choice but to be guided, not by the 
spirit, but by the letter of my instructions. You under- 
stand me, I am sure? You know, if I had not been fet- 
tered in this way, how gladly I should have accepted your 
services?” ' 

“ Say no more ! ” returned Obenreizer. “ In your place 
I should haye done the same. My good friend, I take no 
offence. 1 thank you for your compliment. We shall be 
travelling , companions, , at any rate,” added Obenreizer. 
“ You go, as I go, at once? ” 

“ At once. I must speak to Marguerite first, of course ! ” 
“Surely l surely I Speak to her this evening. Come, 
and pick me up on the way to the station. We go to- 
gether by the mail train to-night? ” 

“By the mail train to-night.” 

It was later than Vendale had anticipated when he drove 
up to the house in Soho-square. Business difficulties, occa- 
sioned by his sudden departure, had presented themselves 
by dozens. A cruelly large share of the time which he had 
hoped to devote to Marguerite had: been claimed by duties 
at his office which it was impossible to neglect. 

To his surprise and delight, she was alone in the draw^ 
ing-room when he entered it* 

“ We have only a few minutes* George*” she said. “ But

Madame Dor had been good to me — and we dan hare those 
few minutes alone.” She threw her arms round his neck, 
and whispered eagerly, “ Hare you done anything to offend 
Mr. Obenteizer? ” 

“ I ! ” exclaimed Vendale, in amazement. 

“ Hush ! ” she said, “ I want to whisper it. You know 
the little photograph I have got of you. This afternoon it 
happened to be on the chimney-piece. He took it up and 
looked at it — and I saw his face in the glass. I know you 
hare offended him I He is merciless; he is revengeful; he 
is as secret as the grave. Don't go with him, George — 
don't go with him ! ” 

“My own love,” returned Vendale, “yoti are letting your 
fancy frighten you ! Obenreizer and I were never better 
friends than we are at this moment.” 

Before a word more could be said, the sudden movement 
of some ponderous body shook the floor of the next room. 
The shock was followed by the appearance of Madame Dor. 
“ Obenreizer ! ” exclaimed this excellent person in a whis- 
per, and plumped down instantly in her regular place by 
the stove. 

Obenreizer came in with a courier's bag strapped Over his 
shoulder. 

“ Are you ready? ” he asked, addressing Vendale. u Can 
I take anything for you? You have no travelling-bag. I 
have got one. Here is the compartment for papers, open 
at your service.” 

“ Thank you,” said Vendale. “ I have only one paper of 
importance with me; and that paper I am bound to take 
charge of myself. Here it is,” he added, touching the 
breast-pocket of his coat, “ and here it must remain till we 
get to Neuch&tel*” 

As he said those words, Marguerite's hand caught his, 
and pressed it significantly. She was looking towards 
Obenreizer. Before Vendale Could look, in his turn, Oben- 
reizer had wheeled round, and was taking leave of Madame 
Dor. 

“Adieu, my charming niece!” he said, turning to Mar- 
guerite next. “ En route, my friend, for Keuchfitel ! ” He 
tapped Vendale lightly over the breast-pocket of his coat, 
and led the way to the door. 

Vendale's last look was for Marguerite. Marguerite's

ACT in* 

IN THE VALLE*. 

It was about the middle of the month of February when 
YendalC and Obenreizer set forth on their expedition. The 
winter being a hard one, the time Was bad for travellers. 
So bad was it that these two travellers, coming to Stras- 
bourg, found its gfeat inns almost empty. And even the 
few people they did encounter in that city, who had started 
from England or from Paris on business journeys- towards 
the interior of Switzerland, were filming back. 

Many of the railroads in Switzerland that tourists pass 
easily enough now, Were almost Or r quite • idipracticdble 
then* Some were not begun; more were not completed! 
On such as were open, there were still large gaps of old 
toad where communication in the winter season Wfts Often 
stopped; on others, there were weak points Where the new 
Work was not safe, either under conditions of severe frost, 
or of rapid thaw. The running of trains on this last class 
was not to be counted on in the worst time of the year, was 
contingent upon weather, or Was wholly abandoned through 
the months considered the ihost dangeroiis. 

At Strasbourg there were more travellers* stories afloat^ 
respecting the difficulties of the way further on, than there 
werfe travellers to relate them. Many of these tales were 
as wild as usual; but the more modestly marvellous did 
derive some colour from the circumstance- that pebple were 
indisputably turning back. However, is the road to Basle 
was open, i/hndale’s resolution to push on was in nowise 
disturbed. Obenreizer’ s resolution was necessarily 5 Yen-; 
dale’s, seeing that he stood at bay thus desperately 
must be ruined, or must destroy the evidence that Yen- 
dale carried about him, even if he destroyed Vendale with it/ 
The state of mind of each of these two fellow-travellers 
towards the other was this, Obenreizer, encircled -by im- 
pending ruin through Vendale’ s qiiickuess of action r and 
seeing the cirtde narrowed eVery hour by Vendale’S energy, 
hated him with the animosity of a fierce cunning lower ani- 
mal. He had always had instinctive movement^ ih his 
breast against Mm; perhaps, because of that old sore of 
gentleman and peasant; perhaps, because of the opfefcndstf

of his nature; perhaps, because of his better looks; per- 
haps, because of his success with Marguerite; perhaps, on 
all those grounds, the two last n6fc the least. And now he 
saw in him, besides, the hunter who was tracking him 
down. Vendale, on the other hand, always contending 
generously against his first vague mistrust, now felt bound 
to contend against it more than ever: reminding himself, 
“He is Marguerite’s guardian. We are on perfectly 
friendly terms; he is my companion of his own proposal, 
and can have no interested motive in sharing this undesir- 
able journey,” To which pleas in behalf of Obenreizer, 
chance added one consideration more, when they came to 
Basle, after a journey of more than twice the average dura- 
tion. 

They had had a late dinner, and were alone in an inn 
room there, overhanging the Rhine: at that place rapid 
and deep, swollen and loud. Vendale lounged upon a 
couch, and Obenreizer walked to and fro : now, stopping at 
the window, looking at the crooked reflections of the town 
lights in the dark water (and perad venture thinking, “ If I 
could fling him into it! ”); now, resuming his walk with his 
eyes upon the floor. 

“ Where shall I rob him, if I can? Where shall I mur- 
der him, if I must? ” So, as he paced the room, ran the 
river, ran the river, ran the river. 

The burden seemed to him at last, to be growing so plain 
that he stopped; thinking it as well to suggest another bur- 
den to his companion. 

“ The Rhine sounds to-night,” he said with a smile , u like 
the old waterfall at home. • That waterfall which my mother 
showed to travellers (I told you of it once). The sound of 
it changed with the weather, as does the sound of all fall- 
ing waters and flowing waters. When, I was pupil of the 
watch-maker, I remembered it as sometimes saying to me 
for whole days, ‘ Who are you, my little wretch? Who 
are you, my little wretch ? 9 I remembered it as saying, 
other times, when its sound was hollow, and storm was 
coming up the Pass : ‘ Boom, boom, boom. Beat him, beat 
him, beat him/ Like my mother enraged — if she was my 
mother.” 

“ If she was? ” said Vendale, gradually changing his at- 
titude to a sitting one* “I£ she was? Why do you say

u What do I know?” replied the other negligently; 
throwing up his h^nds and letting them fall as they would, 
“ What would you have? I am so obscurely born, that 
how can I say? I was very young, and all the rest of the 
family were men and women, and my so-called parents 
were old. Anything is possible of a case like that? ” 

“ Did you ever doubt -? ” 

“I told you once, I doubt the marriage of those two,” he 
replied, throwing up his hands again, as if. he were throw- 
ing the unprofitable subject Away. “ But here I ajn in 
Creation. /come of no fine family. What does it 
ter?” 

“ At least you are Swiss,” said Vendale, after following 
him with his eyes to and fro. 

“ How do I know?” he retorted abruptly, and stopping 
to look back over his shoulder. “I say to you, at least 
you are English. How do you know? ” 

“ By what I have been told from infancy.” 

“ Ah ! I know of myself. that way;” 

“ And,” added Vendale, pursuing; the thought that he 
could not drive back, “by my earliest recollections.” 

“I also. I know of myself that way— if that way satis- 
fies.” 

“ Does it not satisfy you? ” 

“ It must. There is nothing like 6 it must 9 in this little 
world. It must. Two short words those, but stronger 
than long proof or reasoning.” 

“ You and poor Wilding were bom in the same year. 
You were nearly of an age,” said Vendale, again thought- 
fully looking after him as he resumed his pacing up and 
down. 

•“Yes. Very nearly.” - ■ ■ > 

Could Obenreizer be the riiissihg man? In the unknown 
association of things, was there a subtler meaning than he 
himself thought, in that theory so 'often on his lips about 
the smallness of the world? Had the Swiss letter present* 
mg him, followed so close on Mrs. Goldstnraw's revelation 
concerning the infant who had been taken away to Switzer- 
land, because he was that infant grown a man? In a world 
where so many depths lie unsounded, it might be. ' The 
chances, or the laws — call them either — that had wrought 
out the revival of Vendale' s own. acquaintance with Oben- 
reizer, and had ripened it into intimacy, and had brought

them here together this present winter night, were hardly 
less curious; while read by such a light, they were seen to 
cohere towards the furtherance of a continuous and an in- 
telligible purpose. 

Vendale’s awakened thoughts ran high while his eyes' 
musingly followed Obenreizer pacing up and down the 
room, the river ever running to the tune : “ Where shall I 
rob him, if I can? Where shall I murder him, if I must? ” 
The secret of his dead friend was in no hazard from Ven- 
dale’s lips; but just as his friend had died of its weight, so 
did he in his lighter succession feel the burden of the trust, 
and the obligation to follow any clue, however obscure. 
He rapidly asked himself, would he like this man to be the 
real Wilding? No. Argue down his mistrust as he 
might, he was unwilling to put such a substitute in the 
place of his late guileless, outspoken, childlike partner. 
He rapidly asked himself, would he like this man to be 
rich? No. He had more power than enough over Mar- 
guerite as it was, and wealth might invest him with more. 
Would he like this man to be Marguerite’s guardian, and 
yet proved to stand in no degree of relationship towards 
her, however disconnected and distant? No. But these 
were not considerations to come between him and fidelity 
to the dead. Let him see to it that they passed him with 
no other notice than the knowledge that they had passed 
him, and left him bent on the discharge of a solemn duty. 
And he did see to it, so soon that he followed his compan- 
ion with ungrudging eyes, while he still paced the room; 
that companion, whom he supposed to be moodily reflecting 
cm his own bipth, and not on another man’s — least of all 
what man’s — violent Death. 

The road in advance from Basle to Neuch&tel was better 
than had been represented. The latest weather had done 
it good. Drivers, both of horses and mules, had come in 
that evening after dark, and had reported nothing more 
difficult to be overcome than trials of patience, harness, 
wheels, axles, and whipcord. A bargain was soon struck 
for a carnage and horses, to take them on in the morning, 
and to start before daylight. 

* Do you lock ybur door at night when travelling? ” asked 
Obenreizer, standing warming his hands by the wood fire in 
Vendale’s chamber, before going to his own. 

“Not I. I sleep too soundly.”

: “ Yon site so sound a dleeper? ” he retorted, With an ad* 
miring look. “ What a blessing 1 99 

“ Anything but a blessing to the rest of the hohse,” tor- 
joined Vendale, “if I had to be knocked up in the morning 
from the outside of iny bedroom door.” 

“I, too,” said Obenreizer, “leave open my room. But 
let me advise you, as a Swiss, who knows : always, when 
you travel in my country, put your papers— and, of course, 
your money— under your pillow. Always the same place.” 

“ You are not complimentary to your countrymen,” 
laughed Vendale. 

“ My countrymen,” said Obenreizer, with that light touch 
of his friend’s elbows by way of Good Night and benedic- 
tion, “ I Suppose, are like the majority of men. And the 
majority of men will take what they can get. Adieu ! At 
four in the. morning.” . ‘ • i 

“Adieu! At four.” 

Left to himself, Vendale raked the logs together, 
sprinkled over them the White wood-ashes lying on the 
hearth, and sat down to compose his thoughts. But they, 
still ran high on theit latest theme, and the ninhing of the 
river tended to agitate father than to quiet them. As he 
sat thinking, what little disposition he had had to steep 
departed. He felt it hopetess’ to lie dbwn yet, and. Sat 
dressed by the fire. Marguerite, Wilding,: Obenreizer, the: 
business he was theix upon, and a thousand ' hopes and 
doubts that had nothing to do with it, Occupied his mind, 
at oriee. Everything seemed to hare power over him, but 
slumber. The departed disposition to sleep kept far away. 

He had sat for a longtime thinking, on the hearth, when 
his candle burned down, ted its light went oat. It was of 
little moment; there was light enough in the fire. He 
changed his attitude,, and, leaning his arm on the chair- 
back, and his chin upon that hand, sat thinking still. 

But he sat between the fire and the bed, and, as the fire 
flickered in the play of air from the fast-flowing river, his 
enlarged shadow fluttered on the white wall by the bedside. 
His attitude gave it an air, half of mourning, and half of 
bending over the bed imploring. His .eyes were observant 
of it, when he became troubled by the disagreeable fancy 
that it was like Wilding’s shadow, and not his own. 

A slight change of place would causO it to disappear. 
He made the change, and the apparition of his disturbed;

fancy vanished He now sat in the shade of a little nook 
beside the fire, and the door of the room was before him. 

It had a long cumbrous iron latch. He saw the latch 
slowly and softly rise. The door opened a very little, and 
came to again : as though only the air had moved it. But 
he saw that the latch was out of the hasp. 

The door opened again very slowly, until it opened wide 
enough to admit some one. It afterwards remained still 
for a while, as though cautiously held open on the other 
side. The figure of a man them entered, with its face 
turned towards the bed, and stood quiet just within the 
door. Until it said, in a low half-whisper, at the same 
time taking one step forward : “ Vendale ! ” 

“ What now?” he answered, springing from his seat; 
“ who is it? ” 

It was Obenreizer, and he uttered a cry of surprise as 
Vendale came upon him from that unexpected direction. 
“Not in bed?” he said, catching him by both shoulders 
with an instinctive tendency to a struggle, “Then some- 
thing is wrong ! ” 

“ What do you mean? ” said Vendale, releasing himself. 

“ First tell me; you are not ill? ” 

“111? No.” 

“ I have had a bad dream about you. How is it that I 
see you up and dressed?” 

“ My good fellow, I may as well ask you how is it that I 
see you up and undressed? ” 

“ I have told you why. I have had a bad dream about 
you. I tried to rest after it, but it was impossible. I could 
not make up my mind to stay where I was, without know- 
ing you were safe; and yet I could not make up my mind 
to come in here. I have been minutes hesitating at the 
door. It is so easy to laugh at a dream that you have not 
dreamed. Where is your candle? ” 

Burnt out.” 

“ I have a whole one in my room. Shall I fetch it? ” 

“Do so.” 

His room was very near, and he was absent for but a few 
seconds. Coming back with the candle in his hand, he 
kneeled down on the hearth and lighted it. As he Mew 
with his breath a charred billet into flame for the purpose, 
Vendale, looking down at him, saw that his lips were white 
and not easy of control.

“Yes!” said Obenreizer, setting the lighted candle On 
the table, “it was a bad dream. Only look at me!" 

His feet were bare; his red-flannel shirt was thrown back 
at the throat, and its sleeves were rolled above the elbows ; : 
his only other garment, a pair of under pantaloons or 
drawers, reaching to the ankles, fitted him close and tight* 
A certain lithe and savage -appearance was on his figure, 
and his eyes were very bright. 

“ If there had been a wrestle with a robber, as I dreamed,” 
said Obenreizer, “you see, I was stripped for it.” 

“And armed, too,” said Yendale, glancing at his girdle. 

“A traveller’s dagger, that I always carry on the road,” 
he answered carelessly, half drawing it from its sheath 
with his left hand, and putting it back again* “Do you 
carry no such thing? ” 

“Nothing of the kind.” 

“ No pistols? ” said Obenreizer, glancing at the table, and 
from it to the untouched pillow. 

“Nothing of the sort.” 

“ You Englishmen are so confident ! You wish to sleep? ” 

“I have wished to sleep this longtime, but I can’t doit.” 

“I neither, after the bad dream. My fire has gone the 
way of your candle. May I come and sit by yours? Two 
o’clock ! It will so soon be four, that it is not worth the 
trouble to go to bed again.” 

“I shall not take the trouble to go to bed at all, now,” 
said Yendale; “ sit here and keep me company, and wel- 
come.” 

Going back to his room to arrange his dress, Obenreizer 
soon returned in a loose cloak and slippers, and they eat 
down on opposite sides of the hearth. In the interval, 
Yendale had replenished the fire from the wood-basket in 
his room, and Obenreizer had put upon the table a flask and 
cup from his. 

“ Common cabaret brandy, I am afraid,” he Said, pouring 
out; “ bought upon the road, and not like yours from Crip- 
ple Corner. But yours is exhausted; so much the worse. 
A cold 1 night, a cold time of night, a cold country, and a 
cold house. This may be better than nothing; try it.”

Booh ! it burns, though ! ” Be had flung what remained in 
the cup, upon the fire. 

Each of thejn leaned an elbow on the table, redlining his 
head upon his hand, and sat looking at the flaring logs. 
Obenreiser remained watchful and still; but Yendale, after 
certain nervous twitches and starts, in one pf which he rose 
to his feet and looked wildly about him, fell into the 
strangest confusion of dreams. He carried his papers in a 
leather case pr pocket-book, in an inner breast-pocket of 
his buttoned travelling ooat; and whatever he dreamed of, 
in the lethargy that got possession of him, something im- 
portunate in these papers called him onfe of that dream, 
though he could not wake from it. He was belated on the 
steppes of Russia (some shadowy person gave that name to 
the place) with Marguerite; and yet the sensation of a 
hand at his breast, softly feeling the outline of the pocket- 
book as he lay asleep before the fire, was present to him. 
He was shipwreqked in an open boat at sea, and having lost 
his clothes, had no other covering than -an old sail; and yet 
a creeping hand, tracing outside all the ofher pockets of the 
dress he actually wore, for papers, and finding none answer 
its touch, warned him to rouse himself. He was in the an- 
cient vault at Cripple Corner, to which was transferred the 
very bed substantial and present in the very room at Basle; 
and Wilding (not dead, as he had supposed, and yet he did 
not wonder much) shook him, and whispered, “Look at that 
man! Don’t you see be ban risen, and is turning the pil- 
low? Why should, he turn the pillow, if not tp seek those 
papers that are: in yppr breast? , Awake j” And yet he 
slept, and wandered off into ether dreama 

Watchful and still, with bis elbow on the table and bis 
head upon that hand, his companion at length said: “ Ven- 
dale! We are called^ Pa s t four!” Them opening his 
eyes, he saw, turned sideways on him, the filmy face of 
Obenreiaer.

It was said in a tone to rouse him, for already he was 
half asleep again. In his preparation for the day,, too, and 
at his breakfast, he was often virtually asleep while in me- 
chanical action. . It was not until the Cold dark day was 
closing ip, that he had any distincSter Impressions of the 
ride than jingling bells, bitter weather, slipping horses, 
frowning hill-sides, bleak, woods, and k Stoppage at some 
wayside house of entertainment, where . they had passed 
through a cowhouse to reach the travellers* room above. 
He had been conscious of little more, except of Obenreizef 
sitting thoughtful at his side all day, and eyeing him much. 

But when he shook off his stupor, Obenteizer was not at 
his Side. The carriage was stopping to bait at another 
wayside house; and a line of long narrow carts, laden with 
casks of wine, and drawn by horses with a quantity of blue 
collar and head-gear, were baiting too. These came from 
the direction in which the travellers were going, and Oben- 
reizer (not thoughtful now, but cheerful and alert) was 
talking with the foremost driver. As Vendale stretched 
his liihbs, circulated his blood, and cleared off the lees of 
his lethargy, with a sharp Tun to and fro in the bracing air, 
the line of carts moved on : the drivers all Saluting Oben- 
reteer as they passed him. 

“ Who are those? ” asked Vendale. 

“They ale our carriers — Defresnier and Company's,’* 
replied Obenreizer. “Those are our casks of wine.” He 
was singing to himself, and lighting a cigar. 

“ I have been drearily dull company to-day,” said Ven- 
dale, “I don't know what has been the matter with me.” 

“ Vou had no sleep last night; and a kind of brain-con- 
gestioii frequently Comes, at first, of such cold,” said Oben- 
reizer: “ I have seen it often. After all, we shall have 
our journey for nothing, it seems.” 1 

“ HoW for nothing? ”

House at Neuch&tel, and a Silk House at Milan? Well,

whom you saw me talking with. He was surprised to see 
me, and said he had that word for you if he met you. 
What do you do? Go back? ” 

, “Go on,” said Yendale. 

“ On? ” 

“On? Yes. Across the Alps, and down to Milan.” 

Obenreizer stopped in his smoking to look at Yendale, 
and then smoked heavily, looked up the road, looked down 
the road, looked down at the stones in the road at his feet. 

“I have a very serious matter in charge,” said Yendale, 
“ more of these missing forms may be turned to as bad aex 
count, or worse; I am urged to lose no time in helping the 
House to take the thief; and nothing shall turn me back.” 

“No?” cried Obenreizer, taking out his cigar to smile, 
and giving his hand to . his fellow-traveller. “ Then noth- 
ing shall turn me back. Ho, driver ! Despatch. Quick 
there ! Let us push on ! ” 

They travelled through the night. There had been snow, 
and there was a partial thaw, and they mostly travelled at 
a foot-pace, and always with many stoppages to breathe the 
splashed and floundering horses. After an hour’s broad 
daylight, they drew rein at the inn-door at Neuch&tel, hav- 
ing been some eight-and-twenty hours in conquering some 
eighty English miles. 

When they had hurriedly refreshed and changed, they 
went together to the house of business of Defresnier and 
Company. There they found the letter which the wine- 
carrier had described, enclosing the tests and comparisons 
of hand- writing essential to the discovery of the Forger. 
Yendale’ s determination to press forward, without resting, 
being already taken, the only question to delay them was 
by what Pass could they cross the Alps? Respecting the 
state of the two Passes of the St. Gotthard and the Sim- 
plon, the guides and mule-drivers differed greatly; and 
both Passes were still far enough off, to prevent the travel- 
lers from having the benefit of any recent experience of 
either. Besides which, they well knew that a fall of snow 
might altogether change the described conditions in a single 
hour, even if they were correctly stated. But, on the 
whole, the Simplon appearing to be the hopefuller route, 
Yendale decided to take it. Obenreizer bore little or no 
part in thq discussion, and scarcely spoke.

lake to Vevay, so into the winding valley between the spurs 
of the mountains, and into the valley of the Rhone. The 
sound of the carriage- wheels, as they rattled on, through 
the day, through the night, became as the wheels of a great 
clock, recording the hours. No change of weather varied 
the journey, after it had hardened into a sullen frost. In 
a sombre-yellow sky, they saw the Alpine ranges; and thef 
saw enough of snow on nearer and much lower hill-tops 
and hill-sides, to sully, by contrast, the purity of lake, tor- 
rent, and waterfall, and make the villages look discoloured 
and dirty. But no snow fell, nor was there £ny snow-drift 
on the road. The stalking along the valley of more or less 
of white mist, changing on their hafir and dress into icicles, 
was the only variety between them and the gloomy sky* 
And still by day, and still by night, the wheels. And still 
they rolled, in the hearing of one of them, to the burden, 
altered from the burden of the Rhine : “ The time is gone 
for robbing him alive, and I must murder him.” 

They came, at length, to the poor little town of Brieg, 
at the foot of the Simplon. They came there after dark, 
but yet could see how dwarfed men’s work and men be- 
came with the immense mountains towering over them; 
Here they must lie for the night; and here was warmth of 
lire, and lamp, and dinner, and wine, and after-conference 
resounding, with guides and drivers. No human creature 
had come across the Pass for four days. The snow above 
r the snow-line was too soft for wheeled carriage, and not 
hard enough for sledge. There was snow in. the sky. 

* There had been snow in the sky for days past, and the mar- 
t vel was that it had not fallen, and the certainty was that it 
■ must fall. No vehicle could cross. The journey might be 
& tried on mules, or it might be tried on foot; but the best 
ii guides must be paid danger-price in either case, and that, 
!; too, whether they succeeded in taking the two travellers 
e' across, or turned for safety and brought them back. 

In this discussion, Obenreizer bore no part whatever. 

. He sat silently smoking by the fire until the room was 
ir cleared and Vendale referred to him. 

? M Bah! I am weary of these poor devils and their trade,” 
y he said, in reply. “ Always the same story. It is the 
tie story of their trade to-day, as it was the story of their 
trade when I was a ragged boy. What do you and I want? 
jjjt We want a knapsack each, and a* inountain-staff each. We

want no guide; we should guide him; he would not guide 
us. We leave our portmanteaus here, and we cross togeth- 
er. We have been on the mountains together before now, 
and I am mountain-born, and I know this Pass — Pass ! — 
rather High Road ! — by heart. We will leave these poor 
devils, in pity, to trade with others; but they must not de- 
lay us to make a pretence of earning money. Which is all 
they mean.” 

Vendale, glad to be quit of the dispute, and to cut the 
knot: active, adventurous, bent on getting forward, and 
therefore very susceptible to the last hint: readily as- 
sented. Within two hours, they had purchased what they 
wanted for the expedition, had packed their knapsacks, 
and lay down to sleep. 

At break of day, they found half the town collected in 
the narrow street to see them depart. The people talked 
together in groups; the guides and drivers whispered apart, 
and looked up at the sky; no one wished them a good jour- 
ney. 

As they began the ascent, a gleam of sun shone from the 
otherwise unaltered sky, and for a moment turned the tin 
spires of the town to silver. 

“ A good omen! ” said Vendale (though it died out while 
he spoke). “ Perhaps our example will open the Pass on 
this side.” 

“No; we shall not be followed,” returned Obenreizer, 
looking up at the sky and back at the valley. “ We shall be 
alone up yonder 


ON THE MOUNTAIN. 

The road was fair enough for stout walkers, and the air 
grew lighter and easier to breathe as the two ascended. 
But the settled gloom remained as it had remained for days 
back. Nature seemed to have come to a pause. The sense 
of hearing, no less than the sense of sight, was troubled by 
having to wait so long for the change, whatever it might be, 
that impended. The silence was as palpable and heavy as 
the lowering clouds — or rather cloud, for there seemed to 
be but one in all the sky, and that one covering the whole 
of it.

pect was not obscured Down in the valley of the Rhone

behind them, the stream could be traced through aH its 
many windings, oppressively sombre and solemn in its ohe 
leaden hue, a colourless waste. Far and high above them, 
glaciers and suspended avalanches overhung the spots where 
they must pass by-and-bye; deep and dark below them on 
their right, were awful precipice and roaring torrent; tre- 
mendous mountains arose in every vista. The gigantic 
landscape, uncheered by a touch of changing light or a soli* 
tary ray of sun, was yet terribly distinct in its ferocity. 
The hearts of two lonely men might shrink a little, if they 
had to win their way for miles and hours among a legion of 
silent and motionless men — mere men like themselves— all 
looking at them with fixed and frowning front. But how 
much more, when the legion is of Nature’s mightiest works, 
and the frown may turn to fury in an instant l 
As they ascended, the road became gradually more rugged 
and difficult. But the spirits of Vendale rose as they 
mounted higher, leaving so much more of the road behind 
them conquered. Obenreizer spoke little, and held on with 
a determined purpose. Both, in respect of agility and en- 
durance, were well qualified for the expedition. Whatever 
the bom mountaineer rCad in the weather-tokens, that was 
illegible to the other, he kept to himself. 

“ Shall we get across to-day? ” asked Vendale. 

“No,” replied the other. “You see how much deeper 
the snow lies here than it lay half a league lower. The 
higher we mount, the deeper the snow will lie. Walking 
is half wading even now. And the days are so short! If 
we get as high as the fifth Refuge, and lie to-night at the 
Hospice, we shall do well.” 

“Is there no danger of the Weather rising in the night,” 
asked Vendale, anxiously, “and snowing us up? ” 

“There is danger enough about us,” said Obenteizer, 
with a cautious glance onward and upward, “to render si- 
lence our best policy. You have heard of the Bridge of the 
GanthCr? ” 

“I have crossed it once.” f 
“ In the summer? ” 

“Yes; in the travelling season. 

“Yea; but it is another thing at this ieasonj” with a 
sneer, as though he were out of temper. “This is not a^

"You are my Guide,” said Vendale, good-humouredly. 
“I trust to you.” 

“ I am your Guide,” said Obenreizer, “ and I will guide 
you to your journey’s end. There is the Bridge before 
us.” 

They had made a turn into a desolate and dismal ravine, 
where the snow lay deep below them, deep above them, 
deep on every side. While speaking, Obenreizer stood 
pointing at the Bridge, and observing Vendale’s face with 
a very singular expression on his own. 

“ If I, as Guide, had sent you over there, in advance, and 
encouraged you to give a shout or two, you might have 
brought down upon yourself tons and tons and tons of 
snow, that would not only have struck you dead, but buried 
you deep, at a blow.” 

“No doubt,” said Vendale. 

“No doubt. But that is not what I have to do, as 
Guide. So pass silently. Or, going as we go, our indis- 
cretion might else crush and bury me. Let us go on ! ” 

There was a great accumulation of snow on the Bridge; 
and such enormous accumulations of snow overhung them 
from projecting masses of rock, that they might have been 
making their way through a stormy sky of white clouds. 
Using his staff skilfully, sounding as he went, and looking 
upward, with bent shoulders, as it were to resist the mere 
idea of a fall from above, Obenreizer softly led. Vendale 
closely followed. They were yet in the midst of their dan- 
gerous way, when there came a mighty rush, followed by a 
sound as of thunder. .Obenreizer clapped his hand on 
Vendale’ s mouth and pointed to the track behind them. 
Its aspect had been wholly changed in a moment. An ava- 
lanche had swept over it, and plunged into the torrent at 
the bottom of the gulf below. 

Their appearance at the solitary Inn not far beyond this 
terrible Bridge, elicited many expressions of astonishment 
from the people shut up in the house. “We stay but to 
rest,” said Obenreizer, shaking the snow from his dress at 
the fire. “ This gentleman has very pressing occasion to 
get across; — tell them, Vendale.” 

“ Assuredly, I have 1 very pressing occasion. I must 
cross.” 

“ You hear, all of you. My friend has very pressing oc- 
casion to get across, and we want no advice and no help.

I am as good a guide, my fellow-countrymen, as any of 
you. Now, give us to eat and drink.” 

In exactly the same way, and in nearly the same words, 
when it was coming on dark and they had struggled through 
the greatly increased difficulties of the road, and had at 
last reached their destination for the night, Obenreizer said 
to the astonished people of the Hospice, gathering about 
them at the fire, while they were yet in the act of getting 
their wet shoes off, and shaking the snow from their 
clothes : 

“ It is well to understand one another, friends all. This 
gentleman ” 

— “Has,” said Vendale, readily taking him up with a 
smile, “ very pressing occasion to get across. Must cross.” 

“ You hear? — has very pressing occasion to get across, 
must cross. We want no advice and no help I am moun- 
tain-bom, and act as Guide. Do not worry us by talking 
about it, but let us have supper, and wine, and bed. ” 

All through the intense cold of the night, the same aw- 
ful stillness. Again at sunrise, no sunny tinge to gild or 
redden the snow. The same interminable waste of deathly 
white; the same immovable air; the same monotonous 
gloom in the sky. 

“Travellers!” a friendly voice called to them from the 
door, after they were afoot, knapsack on back and staff in 
hand, as yesterday : “ recollect ! There are five places of 
shelter, near together, on the dangerous road before ytou;> 
and there is the wooden cross, and there is the next Hos^ 
pice. Do not stray from the track. If the Tourmente 
comes on, take shelter instantly ! ” 

“ The trade of these poor devils! ” said Obenreizer to his 
friend, with a contemptuous backward wave of his hand 
towards the voice “ How they stick to their trade ! You 
Englishmen say we Swiss are mercenary. Truly, it does 
look like it ” 

They had divided between the two knapsacks, such re- 
freshments as they had been able to obtain that morning, 
and as they deemed it prudent to take. Obenreizer carried 
the wine as his share of the burden; Yendale, the bread 
and meat and cheese, and the flask of brandy. 

They had for some time laboured upward and onward 
through the snow— which was now above their knees in the 
track, and of unknown depth elsewhere — and they werd

still labouring upward and onward through the most fright- 
ful part of that tremendous desolation, when snow began to 
faLL At first, but a few flakes descended slowly and stead- 
ily. After a little while the fall grew much denser, and 
suddenly it began without apparent cause to whirl itself 
into spiral shapes. Instantly ensuing upon this last 
change, an icy blast came roaring at them, and every sound 
and force imprisoned until now was let loose. 

One of the dismal galleries through which the road is car- 
ried at that perilous point, a cave eked out by arches of 
great strength, was near at hand. They straggled into it, 
and the storm raged wildly. The noise of the wind, the 
noise of the water, the thundering down of displaced masses 
of rock and snow, the awful voices with which not only 
that gorge but every gorge in the whole monstrous range 
seemed to be suddenly endowed, the darkneas as of night, 
the violent revolving of the snow which beat and broke it 
into spray and blinded them, the madness of everything 
around insatiate for destruction, the rapid substitution of 
furious violence for unnatural calm, and hosts of appalling 
sounds for silence: these were things, on the edge of a deep 
abyss, to chill the blood, though the fierce wind, made ac- 
tually solid by ice and snow, had failed to chill it. 

Obenreizer, walking to and fro in the gallery without 
ceasing, signed to Yendale to help him unbuckle his knap- 
sack. They could see each, other, but could not have heard 
each other speak. Yendale complying, Obenreizer pro- 
duced his bottle of wine, and poured some out, motioning 
Yendale to take that for warmth's sake, and not brandy. 
Yendale again complying, Obenreizer seemed to drink after 
him, and tee two walked backwards and forwards side by 
side ; both well knowing that to rest or sleep would be .to die. 

The snow came driving heavily into the gallery by the 
upper end at which they would pass out of it, if they ever 
passed out; for greater dangers lay on the road behind 
them than before. The snowisoon began to choke the anch. 
An hour more, and it lay so high as to block out half of 
the returning daylight. But it froze hard now, as it fell, 
and oould be clambered through or over The violence of 
the mountain storm was gradually yielding to a steady 
snowfall. The wind still raged at intervals, hut not in- 
cessantly; and when it paused, the snow fell in heavy 
flakes.

They might have been two hours in their frightful prison, 
when Obenreizer, now crunching into the mound, now creep- 
ing over it with bis head bowed down and his body touch- 
ing the top of the arch, made his way out. Vendale fol- 
lowed close upon him, but followed without clear motive or 
calculation, For the lethargy of Basle was creeping over 
him again, and mastering his senses. 

How far he had followed out of the gallery, or with what 
obstacles he had since contended, he knew not. He be*- 
came roused to the knowledge that Obenreizer had set upon 
him, and that they were struggling desperately in the snow, 
He became roused to the remembrance of what his assailant 
carried in a girdle; He felt for it, drew it, struck at him, 
struggled again, struck at him again, cast him off, and stood 
face to face witii him. 

" I promised to guide you to your journey’s end,” said 
Obenreizer, " and I have kept my promise. The journey of 
your life ends here. Nothing can prolong it You are 
sleeping as you stand.” 

" You are a villain. What have you done to me? ” 

“ You are a fool. I have drugged you. You are doubly 
a fool, for X drugged you once before upon the journey, to 
try you. You are trebly a fool, for I am the thief and 
forger, and in a few moments I shall take those proofs 
against the thief and forger from your insensible body.” 

The entrapped man tried to throw off the lethargy, but 
its fatal hold upou him was so sure that, even, while he 
beard those words, he stupidly wondered which of them 
had been wounded, and whose blood it was that he saw 
sprinkled on the snow,. 

“ What have I done to you,” he asked, heavily and thick- 
ly, “ that you should be — so base— a murderer? ” 

“Hone to me? You would have destroyed me, but that 
you have come to your journey’s end, Your cursed activ- 
ity interposed between me, and the time I had counted on 
in which I might have replaced the money. Done to me? 
You have come in my way— not once, not twice, but again 
and again and again, pid X try to shake you off in the 
beginning, or no? You were not to be shaken off. There- 
fore you die here *’

rently, tried to pick up the iron-shod staff he had let fajl; 
failing to touch it, tried to stagger on without its aid. All

in vain, all in vain! He stumbled; and fell heavily for- 
ward on the brink of the deep chasm. 

Stupefied, dozing, unable to stand upon his feet, a veil 
before his eyes, his' sense of hearing deadehed, he made 
such a vigorous rally that, supporting himself on his hands, 
he saw his enemy standing calmly over him, and heard him 
speak. 

“ You call me murderer,” said Obenreizer, with a grim 
laugh. “ The name matters very little. But at least I 
have set my life against yours, for I am surrounded by 
dangers, and may never make my way out of this place. 
The Tourmente is 1 rising again. The snow is now on the 
whirl. I must have the papers now. Every moment has 
my life in it.” 

“ Stop ! ” cried Yendale, in a terrible voice * staggering up 
with a last flash of fire breaking out of him, and clutching 
the thievish hands at his bredst, in both of his. “ Stop! 
Stand away from me ! God bless my Marguerite l Hap- 
pily she will never know how I died. Stand off from me, 
and let me look at your murderous face. Let it remind 
me— of something — left to say.” 

The sight of him fighting so hard for his senses, and the 
doubt whether he might not fof the instant be possessed by 
the strength of a dozen men, kept his opponent still. 
Wildly glaring at him, Yendale faltered out the broken 
w;ords: 

“ It shall not be— the trust — of the dead — betrayed 
by Ine — reputed parents — misinherited fortune— see to 
it!” 

As his head dropped on his breast; and he stumbled on 
the brink of the chasm as before^ the thievish hands went 
once more, quick and busy, to his breast. He made a con- 
vulsive attempt to 6ry “ No !” desperately rolled himself 
over into the gulf; and sank awayffom his enemy’s touch, 
like a phantom in a dreadful dream. 


The mountain storm raged again, and passed again. 
The awful mountain- voices died Away, the moon rose, and 
the soft and silent snow fell.

One of the men said to the other: “We may venture 
now. We may find them in one of the five Refuges.” 
Each fastened on his back, a basket; each took in his hand, 
a strong spiked pole; each girded under his arms, a looped 
end of a stout rope, so that they were tied together. 

Suddenly the dogs desisted from their gambols in the 
snow, stood looking down the ascent, put their noses up, 
put their noses down, became greatly excited, and broke 
into a deep loud bay together. 

The two men looked in the faces of the two dogs. The 
two dogs looked, with at least equal intelligence, in the 
faces of the two men. 

“Au secours, then! Help! To the rescue ! ” cried the 
two men. The two dogs, with a glad, deep, generous bark, 
bounded away. 

“ Two more mad ones ! ” said the men, stricken motion- 
less, and looking away into the moonlight. “ Is it possible 
in such weather ! And one of them a woman ! ” 

Each of the dogs had the comer of a woman’s dress in 
its mouth and drew her along. She fondled their heads as 
she came up, and she came up through - the snow with an 
accustomed tread. Not so the, large man with her, who 
was spent and winded. 

“Dear guides, dear friends of travellers! I am of your 
country. We seek two gentlemen crossing the Pass, who 
should have reached the Hospice this evening.” 

“They have reached it, ma’amselle.” 

“ Thank Heaven ! O thank Heaven ! ” 

“ But, unhappily, they have gone on again. We are set- 
ting forth to seek them even now. We had to wait until 
the Tourmente passed. It has been fearful up here.” 

“Dear guides, dear friends of travellers! Let me go 
with you. Let me go with. you, fpr the love of God ! One

The good tough fellows were moved. ’“Aftdr all,” they 
murmured to one another, “ she speaks but the truth. She 
knows the ways of the mountains, $ee how marvellously 
She has come here! But as to Monsieur there, ma’am* 
selle? ” 

“Dear Mr. Joey, 0 said- Marguerite, addressing him in 
his own tongue, “you will remain at the house, and wait 
for me; will you not? 0 

“If I know’d which o’ you two recommended it,” 
growled Joey Ladle, eyeing the two men with great indig- 
nation, “Pd fight you for sixpence, and give you half-a- 
crown towards your expenses No, Miss. I’ll stick by 
you as long as there’s any sticking left in me, and I’ll die 
for you when I can’t do better.” 

The state of the moon rendering it highly important that 
no time should be lost, and the dogs showing signs of great 
uneasiness, the two men quickly took their resolution. The 
rope that yoked them together was exchanged for a longer 
one; the party were secured, Marguerite second, and the 
Cellarman last; and they set out for the Refuges. The 
actual distance of thoari plriceS was nothing; the whole five 
and the next HoSpiCe to boot, 'being within two miles; bat 
the ghastly way was whitened out and sheeted over. 

They made ho miss in reaching the Gallery where the 
two had taken shelter. The : Second storm of wind and 
snow had so wildly swept over it since, that their tracks 
were gone. But the dhgs went to and fro with their noses 
down, and were confident. The party stopping, however, 
at the further arch, where the second storm had been espe- 
cially furious, and where the drift was deep, the dogs be- 
came troubled, and went about arid about, in quest of a lost 
purpose. 

The great abyss being known to lie on the right, they 
wandered tori much to the left, and had to regain the way 
with infinite labour through a deep field of snow. The 
leader of the line had Stopped it, and was taking note of 
the landmar ks, when otte of the dogs fell to tearing tip the 
snow a little before them. Advancing and stooping to 
look at it, thinking that some one might be overwhelmed 
there, they Sriw that it was stained, and that the stain was 
red. 

The other dog was now seen to look over the brink of the 
gulf, with his fore legs straightened out, lest he should fall

into it, and to tremble in every limb. Then the dog who 
had found the stained show joined him, and then they ran 
to and fro, distressed and whining. Finally, they both 
stopped on the brink together, and setting up their heads, 
howled dolefully. 

“ There is some one lying below,” said Marguerite, 

“ I think so, r said the foremost man. “ Stand well in- 
ward, the two last, and let us look over.” 

The last man kindled two torches from his basket, and 
handed them forward. The leader taking one, and Mar- 
guerite the other, they looked down: now shading the 
torches, now moving them to the right or left, now raising 
them, now depressing them, as moonlight far below con- 
tended with black shadows. A piercing cry from Margue- 
rite broke a long silence. 

“ My God ! On a projecting point, where a wall of ice 
stretches forward oveT the torrent, I see a human form ! ” 

“ Whefe, ma’amselle, where? 

“ See, there ! On the shelf of ice below the dogs ! ” 

The leader, with a siokened aspect, drew inward, and 
they were all silent. But they were not all inactive, for 
Marguerite, with b\yift and skilful fingers, had detached 
both herself and him from the rope in a few seconds. 

“ Show me the baskets. These two are the only 
ropes ? 7J 

“The only ropes here, ma’amselle; but at the Hos- 
pice ” 

“ If he is alive<— I know it is my lover— he will be dead 
before you can return. Dear Guides 1 Blessed frieuds of 
travellers! Look at me! Watch my hands. If they fal- 
ter or go wrong, make me your prisoner by force. If they 
axe steady and go right, help me to save him ! 

She girded herself with a cord under the breast and arms, 
she formed it into a kind of jacket, she drew it into knots, 
she laid its end side by side with the end of the other 
cord, she twisted and twined the two together, she knotted 
them together, she set her foot upon the knots, she strained 
them, she held them for the two men to strain at, 

“ She is inspired,” they said to one another. 

“By the Almighty’s mercy!” she exclaimed, “You 
both know that I am by far the lightest here* Give me 
the brandy and the wine, and lower me down to him. 
Then go for assistance and a stronger rope. You see that

when it is lowered to me — look at this about me now — I 
can make it fast and safe to his body. Alive or dead, I 
will bring him up, or die with him. I love him passion- 
ately. Can I say more? ” 

They turned to her companion, but he was lying sense- 
less on the snow. 

“ Lower me down to him,” she said, taking two little 
kegs they had brought, and hanging them about her, “ or I 
will dash myself to pieces ! I am a peasant, and I know 
no giddiness or fear; and this is nothing to me, and I pas- 
sionately love him. Lower me down ! ” 

“ Ma’amselle, ma’amselle, he must be dying or dead.” 

“ Dying or dead, my husband’s head shall lie upon my 
breast, or I will dash myself to pieces.” 

They yielded, overborne. With such precautions as 
their skill and the circumstances admitted, they let her slip 
from the summit, guiding herself down the precipitous icy 
wall with her hand, and they lowered down, and lowered 
down, and lowered down, until the cry came up : “ Enough ! ” 

“ Is it really he, and is he dead? ” they called down, 
looking over. 

The cry came up : “ He is insensible; but his heart beats. 
It beats against mine.” 

“ How does he lie? ” 

The cry came up : “ Upon a ledge of ice. It has thawed 
beneath him, and it will thaw beneath me. Hasten. If 
we die, I am content.” 

One of the two men hurried off with the dogs at such 
topmost speed as he could make; the other set up the 
lighted torches in the snow, and applied himself to recov- 
ering the Englishman. Much snow-chafing and some 
brandy got him on his legs, but delirious and quite uncon- 
scious where he was. 

The watch remained upon the brink, and his cry went 
down continually: “ Courage! They will 1 soon be here. 
How goes it? ” And the cry came up : ‘‘’His heart still 
beats against mine. I warm him in my arms. I have cast 
off the rope, for the ice melts under us, and the rope would 
separate me from him; but I am not afraid.” 

The moon went down behind the mountain tops, and all 
the abyss lay in darkness. The cry went down: “ How 
goes it? ” The cry came up : “ We are sinking lower, but 
his heart still beats against mine.”

At length, the eager barking of the dogs, and a flare of 
light upon the snow, proclaimed that help was coming on. 
Twenty or thirty men, lamps, torches, litters, ropes, blank- 
ets, wood to kindle a great fire, restoratives and stimulants, 
came in fast. The dogs ran from one man to another, and 
from this thing to that, and ran to the edge of the abyss, 
dumbly entreating Speed, speed, speed ! 

The cry went down: “ Thanks to God, all is ready. 
How goes it? ” 

The cry came up: “We are sinking still, and we are 
deadly cold. His heart no longer beats against mine. Let 
no one come down to add to our weight. Lower the rope 
only.” 

The fire was kindled high, a great glare of torches lighted 
the sides of the precipice, lamps were lowered, a strong 
rope was lowered. She could be seen passing it round him, 
and making it secure. 

The cry came up into a deathly silence : “ Raise ! Softly ! ” 
They could see her diminished figure shrink, as he was 
swung into the air. 

They gave no shout when some of them laid him on a 
litter, and others lowered another strong rope. The cry 
again , came up into a deathly silence: “Raise! Softly!” 
But when they caught her at the brink, then they shouted, 
then they wept, then they gave thanks to Heaven, then 
they kissed her feet, then they kissed her dress, then tlve 
dogs caressed her, licked her icy hands, and with their 
honest faces Warmed her frozen bosom I 

She broke from them. all, and sank over him on his litter, 
with both her loving hands upon the heart that stood still. 

ACT IV. 

THE CLOCK-LOCK. 

The pleasant scene was N'euch&tel; the pleasant month 
•was April; the pleasant plane was a .notary’s office; the 
pleasant person in it was the notary: a rosy, hearty, hand- 
some old man, chief notary of Neuch&tel, known far and 
wide in the canton as Maitre Voigt. Professionally and 
personally, the notary was a popular citizen. His innumer- 
able kindnesses and his innumerable oddities had for years 
made him one of the recognised public characters of the 
pleasant Swiss town. His long brown frock-coat and his

black skull-cap were among the institutions of thejdace; 
and he earned a snuff-box which, in point of size,' was pop- 
ularly believed to be without a parallel in Europe. 

There was another person in the notary’s office, not so 
pleasant as the notary. This was Obenreizer. 

An oddly 1 pastoral kind of office it was, and one that 
would never have answered in England. It stood in a neat 
back-yard, fenoed off from a pretty flower-garden. Goats 
browsed in the doorway, and a cow was within half a dozen 
feet of keeping company with the clerk. Maitre Voigt’s 
room was a bright and varnished little room, with panelled 
walls, like a toy-chamber. According to the seasons of the 
year, roses, sunflowers, hollyhocks, peeped in at the win- 
dows. Maitre Voigt’s bees hummed through the office all 
the summer, in at this window and out at that, taking it 
frequently in their day’s work, as if honey were to be made 
from Maitre Voigt’s sweet disposition. A large musical 
box on the chimney-piece often trilled away at the Over- 
ture to Fra Diavolo, or a Selection from William Tell, with 
a chirruping liveliness that had to be stopped by force on 
the entrance of a client, and irrepressibly broke out again 
the moment his back Was turned. 

“ Courage, courage, my good fellOw ! ” said Maitre Voigt, 
patting Obenreizer on the knee, in a fatherly and comfort- 
ing way. “ You will begin a new life* tO-morrow morning 
in my office here.” > ’ 

Obenreizer — dressed in mourning, and subdued in man- 
ner — lifted his hand, with a white handkerchief in it, to 
the region of his heart. “The gratitude is here,” he said. 
“But the words to express it are not here.” 

“Ta-ta-ta! Don’t talk to me about gratitude!” said 
Maitre Voigt. “ I hate to see a man oppressed. I see you 
oppressed, and I hold out my hand to you by instinct. Be- 
sides, I am not too old yet, to remeinber my young days. 
Yout father sent me my first client. (It was on a question 
of half an acre of vineyard that seldom bore any grapes.) * 
Do I owe nothing to your father’s son? I owe him a debt 
of friendly obligation, and I pay it to you. That’s rather 
neatly expressed, I think,” added Maitre Voigt, in high 
good humour with himself. “ Permit me to reward my own 
merit with a pinch of snuff! ” 

Obenreizer dropped his eyes to the ground, as though he 
Ivefe not even Worthy to see the notary take snuff.

“Do me one last favour, sir,” he said, when he raised 
his eyes. “ Do not act on impulse. Thus far, you have 
only a general knowledge of my position. Hear the case 
for and against me, in its details, before you take me into 
your office. Let my claim on your benevolence be recog- 
nised by your sound reason as well as by your excellent 
heart. In that case, I may hold up my head against the 
bitterest of my enemies, and build myself a new reputation 
on the ruins of the character I have lost.” 

“As you will,” said Maltre Voigt. “Ydu speak well, 
my son. You will be a fine lawyer one of these days.” 

“The details are not many,” pursued Obenreizer. “My 
troubles begin with the accidental death of my late travel- 
ling companion, my lost dear friend, Mr. Vendale.” 

“ Mr. Vendale,” repeated the notary. ' “ Just so. I have 
heard and read of the name, several times within these two 
months. The name of the unfortunate English: gentleman 
who was killed on the Simplon. When you got that sear 
ppon your cheek and neck.” 

“ — From my own knife,” said Obenreizer, touching what 
must have been an ugly gash at the time of its infliction. 

“From your own knife,” assented the notary, “and in 
trying to save him. Good, good, good. That wats very 
good. Vendale. Yes. I have several times, lately, 
thought it droll that I should once have had a client of that 
name.” ' 

“ But the world, sir,” returned Obenreizer, “ is bo small ! ” 
Nevertheless he made a mental ndte that the notary Lad 
once had a client of that name. 

“As I was saying, sir, the death of that dear travelling 
comrade begins my troubles. What follows? I save my- 
self* I go down to Milan. I am reeeived with coldness 
by Def resnier and Company. Shortly afterwards, I aip 
discharged by Defresnier and Company. Why? They 
give no reason why. I ask, do they assail my honour? 
No answer. I ask, what is the imputation . against me? 
No answer. < I ask, where are their proofs against me?i No 
answer. I ask, what am. I to think? The reply, is, /M* 
Obenreizer is free to think What he will* What M. Oben- 
reizer thinks, is of no importance to Defresnier and Com- 
pany/ And that is all.” < 

“Perfectly. That is all,” assented the. notary, taking a 
large pi$cko£ snuff.

“ But is that enough, sir? ” 

“ That is not enough,” said Maitre Yoigt. “ The House 
of Defresnier are my fellow-townsmen — much respected, 
much esteemed — but the House of Defresnier must not si- 
lently destroy a man’s character. You can rebut assertion. 
But how can you rebut silence? ” 

“ Your sense of justice, my dear patron,” answered Oben- 
reizer, “ states in a word the cruelty of the case. Does it 
stop there? No. For, what follows upon that? ” 

“Trtie, my poor boy,” said the notary, with a comfort- 
ing nod or two; “your ward rebels upon that.” 

' “Rebels is too soft a word,” retorted Obenreizer. “My 
ward revolts from me with horror. My ward defies me. 
My ward withdraws herself from my authority, and takes 
shelter (Madame' Dor with her) in the house of that Eng- 
lish lawyer, Mr. Bintrey, who replies to your summons to 
her to submit herself to my authority, that she will not do 
so.” . 

“ — And who afterwards writes,” said the notary, moving 
his large snuff-box to look among the papers underneath it 
for the letter, “that he is coming to confer with meJ’ 

• “ Indeed? ” replied Obenreizer, rather checked. “ Well, 
sir. Have I ho legal rights? ” 

f , “Assuredly, my poor boy,” returned the notary. “All 
hut felons have their legal rights.” 

“ And who calls me felon? ” said Obenreizer, fiercely. 

1 “No one! Be calm under your wrongs. If the House 
of Defresnier would call you felon, indeed, we should know 
how to deal with them.” 

While saying these words, he had handed Bintrey ’s very 
short letter to Obenreizer, who. now read it and gate it back 

“In saying,” observed Obenreizer with recovered com- 
posure, “that he is coming to confer with you, this English 
lawyer means that hp is coming to deny my authority over 
my ward.”, J 

. You think so? ” 

“I am sure of it* I know him. He is obstinate and 
contentious. You will tell me, my: dear sir, whether my 
authority is unassailable, until nay ward is of age? ” 

■ “ Absolutely unassailable.” » 

“ I will enforce it. I will make her submit herself to it. 
iFor,” said Obenreizer, changing his angry tone to one of 
grateful submission, “I owe it to you, air; to yon, who

have so confidingly taken an injured man under. your prch 
tection, and into your employment.” , 

“Make your mind easy,” said Maitre Voigt. “No more 
of this now, and no thanks ! Be here to-morrow morning, 
before the other clerk comes— between seven and eight. 
You will find me in this room; and I will myself initiate 
you in your work. Go away! go away! I have letters to 
write; I won’t hear a word more.” 

Dismissed with this generous abruptness, and, satisfied 
with the favourable impression he had left on the old man’s 
mind, Obenreizer was at leisure to revert to the mental note 
he had made that Maitre Voigt once had a client whose 
name was Vendale. 

“I ought to know England well enough by this time; ” 
so his meditations ran, as he sat on a bench in the yard; 
“and it is not a name I ever encountered there, except — ” 
he looked involuntarily over his shoulder-r-** as his name. 
Is the world so small that I cannot get away from him, 
even now when he is dead? He confessed at the last that 
he had betrayed the trust of the dead, and misinherited a 
fortune. And I was to see to it. And I was to stand off, 
that my face might remind him of it. Why my face, unless 
it concerned me? I am sure of his words, for they have 
been in my ears ever since. Can there be anything bear- 
ing on them, in the keeping of this old idiot? Anything 
to repair my fortunes, and blacken his memory? He dwelt 
upon my earliest remembrances, that night at Basle. Why, 
unless he had a purpose in it? ” . ' : ! 

Maitre Voigt’s two largest he-goats were butting at him 
to butt him out of the place, as if for that disrespectful 
mention of their master. So he got up and left the place. 
But he walked alone for a long time on the border of the 
lake, with his head drooped in deep thought. ; 

Between seven and eight next morning, he presented 
himself at the office. He found the notary ready for him, 
at work on some papers which had come in on the previous 
evening. In a few clear words, Maitre Voigt explained 
the routine of the office, and the duties Obenreizer would 
be expected to perform. It still wanted five minutes to 
eight when the preliminary instructions were declared to 
be complete. 

“ I will show you over the house and the offices,” said 
Maitre Voigt, “ but I must put away these papers first.

ThUy 'Come from the- municipal authorities and they must 
be taken special care of.” 

Obenreizer saw his chance here of finding out the reposi- 
tory in which his employer's private papers were kept. 

“ Can't I Save you the trouble, sir? ” he asked. “ Can't 
I put those documents away under your directions? ” 

Maitre Voigt laughed softly to himself $ closed the port- 
folio in which the papers had been sent to him* handed it 
to Obenreizer. 

“ Suppose you try,” he said. “ All my papers of impor- 
tance are kept yonder* 

He pointed to a heavy oaken door, thickly studded with 
nails, at the lower end of the room. Approaching the 
door, with the portfolio, Obenreizer discovered, td his 
astonishment, that there were no means whatever of open- 
ing it from the outside. There was no handle, no bolt, no 
key, and (climax of passive obstruction!) no keyhole. 

“There is a second door to this room? ” said Obenreizer, 
appealing to the 1 notary. 

“No,” said Maitre Voigt. “Guess again.” 

“ There is a window? ” 

“Nothing of the sort. The (window has been bricked 
up. The only way in, is the way by that door. Do you 
give it up? ” cried Maitre Voigt in high triumph*. Listen, 
my good fellow, and tell me if you hear nothing inside? ” 

Obenreizer listened for a momdut, and started back from 
tbe door. 

“ I know ! ” he exclaimed. “ I heard of this when I Was 
apprenticed here at the watch-maker's. Perrin Brothers 
have finished their famous clock-lock at last— and you have 
got it?” 

“Bravo!” said Maitre Voigt “The clock-lock it is! 
There, my son ! There you have one mote of what the 
good people of this town call ‘Daddy Voigt's follies.' 
With all my heart! Let those laugh who win. No thief 
can steal my keys. No burglar can pick my lock. No 
power on earth, short of a battering-ram or a barrel of 
gunpowder, can move that door,, till my little sentinel in- 
side— my worthy friend who goes ‘Tick* Tick,' as I tell 
him— **ays, ‘Open! ' The big door obeys the little Tick, 
Tick, and the little Tick, Tick, obeys me . That!” cried 
Daddy Voigt, snapping his fingers, “for all the thieves in 
.Christendom ! ”

^May I see it in action? 11 asked Obenreizer. “Pardon 
my curiosity, dear sir! You know that I was once a toler- 
able worker in the clock trade." 

“ Certainly you shall Bee it in action,” said Maitre Voigt; 
“What is the time now? One minute to eight. Watch, 
and in one minute you will see the door open of itself." 

In one minute, smoothly and slowly and silently, as if 
invisible hands had. set it free, the. heavy door opened in- 
ward, and disclosed a dark chamber beyond. On three 
sides, shelves filled the walls, from floor to ceiling. Ar- 
ranged on the shelves, were rows upon rows of boxes made 
in the pretty inlaid woodwork of Switzerland, and bearing 
inscribed on their fronts (for the most part in fanciful 
coloured letters) the names of the notary’s clients. 

Maitre Voigt lighted a taper, and led the way into the 
room. 

“ You shall See the clock,” he said, proudly. “ I possess 
the greatest curiosity in Europe. It is only a privileged 
few whose eyes . can look at it. I give the privilege to 
your good father’s son-^-you shall be one of the favoured 
few who enter the room with me. See ! here it is, on the 
right-hand wall at the side of the door." 

“An ordinary clock,” exclaimed Obenreizer. “No! Not 
an ordinary clock. It has only one hand,” 

“Aha!” said Maitre Voigt. “Not an ordinary clock, 
my friend. No, no. That one hand goes round the dial. 
As I put it, so it regulates the hour at which the door shall 
open. See ! The hand points to eight. At eight the door 
opened, as you saw for yourself.” 

“ Does it open more than once in the four-and-r twenty 
hours? " asked Obenreizer; 

“More than once?” repeated the notary, with great 
scorn. “You don’t: know my good friend, Tick, Tick! 
He will open the door as often as I ask him. All he wants, 
is his directions, and he gets them here* Look below the 
dial. Here is a halfrcircle of steel let into the wall, and 
here is a hand (called the regulator) that travels round it, 
just as my hand chooses. Notice, if you please, that there 
are figures to guide me on the half -circle of steel. Figure 
I. means : Open once in the four-and-fcwenty hours. Figure 
II means: Open twice; and so on to the end. I set the 
regulator every morning, after I have read my letters, and 
when I know what my day’s work is to be. Would you

like to see me set it now? What is to-day? Wednesday. 
Good l This is the day of our rifle-club; there is little 
business to do; I grant a half-holiday. No work here to- 
day, after three o’clock. Let us first put away this port- 
folio of municipal papers. There! No need to trouble 
Tick, Tick to open the door until eight to-morrow. Good ! 
I leave the dial-hand at eight; I put back the regulator to 
6 1.’ ; I close the door; and closed the door remains, past 
all opening by anybody, till -to-morrow morning at eight.” 

< Obenreizer’ s quickness instantly saw the means by which 
he might make the clock-lock betray its master’s confidence, 
and place its master’s papers at his disposal. 

“Stop, sir!” he cried, at the moment when the notary 
was closing the door. “Don’t I see something moving 
ainong the boxes— on the floor there? ” 

(Maitre Yoigt turned his back for a moment to look. In 
that moment, Obenreizer’s ready hand put the regulator on 
from the figure # I.” tb the figure “ II.” Unless the notary 
looked again at the half-circle of steel, the door would 
open at eight that evening, as well as at eight next morn- 
ing, and nobody but Obenreizer would know it.) 

“ There is nothing ! ” said Maitre Yoigt. “ Your trou- 
bles have shaken your nerves, my son. Some shadow 
thrown by my taper; or some poor little beetle, who lives 
among the old lawyer’s secrets, running away from the 
light. Hark ! I hear your fellow-clerk in the office. To 
work! to- work! and build to-day the first step that leads 
‘to your new fortunes ! ” 

He good humouredly pushed Obenreizer out before him; 
extinguished the taper, with a last fond glance at his clock 
which passed harmlessly over the regulator beneath; and 
closed the oaken door. 

At three the office was shut up. The notary and every- 
body in the' notary’s employment, with one exceptibn, went 
to see the rifle-shooting. Obenreizer had pleaded that he 
was not in spirits for a public festival. Nobody knew 
what had become of him. It was believed that he had 
slipped away for a solitary walk. 

The house and offices had been closed but a few minutes, 
when the door of a shining wardrobe, in the notary’s shin- 
ing room, opened, and Obenreizer stepped out. He walked 
to a window, unelosed the- shutters, satisfied himself that 
he cbuld escape unseen by way of the garden, turned back

into the room, and took his plaee in the notary's easy^chatir. 
He was locked up in the house, and there were five hours 
to wait before eight o’clock came* 

He wore his way through the five hours : sometimes 
reading the books and newspapers that lay on the table : 
sometimes thinking : sometimes walking to and fro. <- SUn*- 
set came on. * He closed the window-shutters before he 
kindled a light. The candle lighted, and the time drawl- 
ing nearer and nearer, he sat, watch in hand, with his eyes 
on the oaken door^ . . , , 

At eight, smoothly and softly and silently the door 
opened. ‘ ' 

One after another, he read the names on the outer rows 
of * boxes. No such niame as Vendale !’ He removed the 
outer row, and looked at the row behind. - These were 
older boxes, and shabbier boxes. The four first that he ex- 
amined were inscribed with French and German names.

open on the table, and began to read them. He had not 
so occupied a minute, when his face fell from its expression 
of eagerness and avidity, to one of haggard astonishment 
and disappointment. But, after a little consideration', he 
copied the papers. He thein replaced the papers, replaced 
the box, closed the door; extinguished the candle* and stole 
away. 1 I •> .■ '! 

As his murderous and thievish footfall passed out of (the 
garden, the steps of the notary and some one accompany- 
ing him stopped at the front door of the house. The lamps 
were lighted in the little street, and the notary had his 
door-key in his hand. ■ 

M Pray do not pass my house* Mr. Bintrey,” he said. 
“ Do me the honour to come in. It is one of our town half- 
holidays — our Tir— but my people will be back directly. 
It is droll that you should ask your way to the Hbfcel of 
me. Let lis eat and drink before you go there." ' 

“ Thank you; not to-night," said Bintrey. “Shall I 
come to you at ten to-morrow? " - ! « 

“I shall be enchanted, sir, to take so early an opportur

nity of redressing the wrongs of. my injured client,” re- 
turned the good notary. 

“ Yes,” retorted Bintrey; “ your injured client is all very 
well — hut— a word in your ear.” 

He whispered to the notary, and Walked off. When the 
notary’s housekeeper came home, she found him standing 
at his door motionless, with the key still in his hand, and 
the door unopened. 

obenreizer’s victory. 

The scene shifts again — to the foot of the Simplon, on 
the Swiss side. 

In one of the dreary rooms of the dreary little Inn at 
Brieg, Mr. Bintrey and Maitre Voigt Sat together at a pro- 
fessional council of two. Mr. Bintrey was searching in his 
despatch-box. Maitre Voigt Was looking towards a closed 
door, painted brown to imitate mahogany, and communi- 
cating with an inner room. 

“Isn’t it time he was here? ” asked the notary, shifting 
his position, and glancing at a second door at the other end 
of the room, painted yellow to imitate deal. 

“He is here,” answered Bintrey, after listening for a 
moment. 

The yellow door Was opened by a waiter, and Obenreizer 
walked in. 

After greeting Maitre Voigt with a cordiality which ap- 
peared to cause the notary no little embarrassment, Oben- 
reizer bowed with grave and distant politeness to Bintrey. 
“For what reason have I been brought from Neuch&tel 
to the foot of the mountain? ” he inquired, taking the seat 
which the English lawyer had* indicated to him. 

“ You shall be quite satisfied on that head before our in- 
terview is over,” returned Bintrey. “ For the present, per- 
mit me to suggest proceeding at once to business. There 
has been a correspondence, Mr. Obenreizer, between you 
and your niece. I am here to represent your niece.” 

“In other words, you, a lawyer, are here to represent 
an infraction of the law.” 

“Admirably put r” said Bintrey. “If all the people I 
ha/ve to deal with were only like you, what an easy profes- 
sion mine would be ! I am here to represent an infraction 
of the law — that is your point of view. I am here to make

compromise between you and your niece— that is my 
point of view.” 

“ There must be two parties to a compromise,” rejoined 
Obenreizer. “ I decline, in this case, to be one of them. 
The law gives me authority to control my niece’s actions, 
until she comes of age. She is not yet of age; and I claim 
my authority.” 

At this point Maitre Voigt attempted to speak. Bintrey 
silenced him with a compassionate indulgence of tone and 
manner* as if he was silencing a favourite child. ' 

“No, my worthy friend, net a word. Don’t excite your- 
self unnecessarily; leave it to me.” He turned, and ad- 
dressed himself again to Obenreizer. “ I can think of noth- 
ing comparable to you, Mr. Obenreizer* but granite — and 
even that wears out in course of time*, In the interests of 
peace and quietness— for the sake of your own dignity — 
relax a little. If you will only delegate your authority to 
another person whom I know of, that person may be trusted, 
never to lose sight of your niece, night Or day ! ” 

“ You are wasting your time and mine,” returned Oben- 
reizer. “If my niece is not rendered up to my authmfty 
within one week from this day, I invoke the law* If you 
resist the law, I take her by force.” 

He rose to his feet as he said the last word. Maitre 
Voigt looked round again towards the brown door which 
led into the inner room. , 

“Have some pity on the poor girl,” pleaded Bintrey* 
“ Remember how lately, she lost her lover by a dreadful 
death ! Will nothing move yoii? ” 

“Nothing.” 

Bintrey, in his turn, rose to his feet* and looked .At 
Maitre Voigt. Maitre Voigt’s hand, testing on the table, 
began to tremble. Maitre’ Voigt’s eyes remained fixed* as 
if by irresistible fascination, on the brown door. Oben- 
reizer, suspiciously observing him, looked that way, too. 

“ There is somebody listening in thete ! ” he exclaimed* 
with a sharp backward glance at Bintrey. . 

“There ate two people listening,” answered Bintrey. 

“Who are they? ” , * , 

“You shall see.” 

With that answer, he raised his voice and spoke the next 
words*-* the two Common words which are on everybody’s 
lips, at every hour of the day : “ Come in ! ”

The brown door opened. Supported on Marguerite’s 
arm — his sunburnt colour gone, his right arm bandaged and 
slung over his breast — Vendale stood before the murderer, 
a man risen from the dead. 

In the moment of * silence that followed, the singing of a 
caged bird in the courtyard outside was the one sound stir- 
ring in the room. Maitre Voigt touched Bintrey, and 
pointed to Obenreizer. “ Look at him ! ” said the notary, 
in a whisper. 

The shook had paralysed every movement in the villain’s 
body, but the movement of the blood. His face was like 
the face of a corpse. The one vestige of colour left in it 
was a livid purple streak which marked the course of the 
scar, where his victim had wounded him on the cheek and 
neck. Speechless, breathless, motionless alike in eye and 
limb, it seemed as if, at the sight of Vendale, the death to 
which he had doomed Vendale had struck him where he 
stood. 

“ Somebody ought to speak to him,” said Maitre Voigt. 
“ Shall I?” 

. Even at that moment, Bintrey persisted in silencing the 
notary, and in keeping thie lead in the proceedings to him- 
self. Checking Maitre Voigt by a gesturie, he dismissed 
Marguerite and Vendale in these words “ The object of 
your appearance here is answered,” he said. “If you will 
withdraw for the present, it may help Mr. Obenreizer to 
recover himself.” 

It did help him. As the two passed through the door, 
and closed it behind them, he drew a deep breath of relief. 
He looked round him for the chair from which he had 
risen, and dropped into it. 

“Give him time!” pleaded Maitre Voigt. 

“No,” said Bintrey. “I don’t know what use he may 
make of it, if I do.” He turned once more to Obenreizer, 
and went on. “I owe it to myself,” he said — “I don’t 
admit, mind, that I owe it to yo%u — to aceount for my ap- 
pearance in these proceedings, and to state what has been 
done under my advice, and on my sole responsibility. Can 
you listen to me? ” 

“ I can listen to you.” 

“ Recall the time when you started for Switzerland with 
Mr. Vendale,” Bintrey began. “ You had not left England 
four-and-twenty hours, before your niece committed an act

of imprudence which not even youi* penetration could fore- 
see. She followed her promised husband on , his journey, 
without asking anybody’s advice or permission, and with- 
out any better companion to protect her than a Cellarman 
in Mr. Yendale ’s employment.” 

“ Why did she follow me on the journey? and how came 
the Cellarman to be the person who accompanied her? ” 

“She followed you on the journey,” answered Bintrey, 
“ because she suspected there had been some serious colli- 
sion between you and Mr. Yendale, which had been kept 
secret from her; and because she rightly believed you to be 
capable of serving your interests, or of satisfying your 
enmity, at the price of a crime. As for the Cellarman, he 
was one, among the other people in Mr. Yendale’ s estab- 
lishment, to whom she had applied (the moment your back 
was turned) to know if anything had happened between 
their master and you. The Cellarman alone had something 
to tell her. A senseless superstition, and a common ac- 
cident which had happened to his master, in his master’s 
cellar, had connected Mr. Yendale in!this man’s mind with 
the idea of danger by murder. Your niece surprised him 
into a confession, which aggravated tenfold the terrors that 
possessed her. Aroused to a sense of the mischief he had 
done, the man, of his own accord, made the one atonement 
in his power. 4 If my master is in danger, Miss,’ he said, 
4 it’s my duty to follow him, too; and it’s more than my 
duty to take care of you.’ The two set forth together — 
and, for once, a superstition has had its use. It decided 
your niece on taking the journey; and it led the way to 
saving a man’s life’s. Do you understand me, so far? ” 

“I understand you, so far.” 

“My first knowledge of the crime that you had com- 
mitted,” pursued Bintrey, “came to me in the form of a 
letter from your niece. All you need, know is that her 
love and her courage recovered the body of your victim, 
and aided the after-efforts which brought him back to life. 
While he lay helpless at Brieg, under her care, she wrote 
to me to come out to him. Before starting, I informed 
Madame Dor that I knew Miss Obenreizer to be safe, and 
knew where she was. Madame Dor informed me, in return, 
that a letter had come for your niece, which she knew to 
be in your handwriting. I took possession of it, and 
arranged for the forwarding of any other letters which

might follow: Arrived At Brieg, I found Mr. Vendale out 
of danger, and at once devoted myself to hastening the day 
of reckoning with you. Defresnier and Company turned 
you off on suspicion; acting on information privately sup- 
plied by me. Having stripped you of your false character, 
the next thing to do was to strip you of your authority over 
your niece. To reach this end, I not only had no scruple 
in digging the pitfall under your feet in the dark— I felt a 
certain professional pleasure in fighting you with your own 
weapong. By my advice, the, truth has been carefully con- 
cealed from yoli, up to this day. By my advice, the trap 
into which you have- walked was set for you (you know 
why, now, as well as I do) in this place. There was but 
one certain way of shaking the devilish self-control which 
has hitherto made you a formidable man. That way has 
been tried, and (look at me as you may) that way has suc- 
ceeded. The last thing that remains to be done,” con- 
cluded Bintrey, producing two little slips of manuscript 
from his despatch-box, * is to set your niece free. You 
have attempted murder, and you hftVe committed forgery 
and theft. We have the evidence ready against you in 
both cases: If you are convicted as a felon, you know as 
well as I do what becomes of your authority over your 
niece. Personally, I should have preferred taking that 
way out of it. But considerations are pressed on me which 
I am not able to resist, and this interview must end, as I 
have told you already, in a compromise. Sign those lines, 
resigning 1 all authority over Miss Obenreizer, and pledging 
yonrself never to be seen in England or in Switzerland 
again*, and. I will sign an indemnity which secures you 
against further proceedings on our part.” 

Obenreizer took the pen, in silence, and signed his niece’s 
release. In receiving the indemnity in return, he rose, but 
made no movement to leave the room. He stood looking 
at Maitre Voigt with a strange smile gathering at his lips, 
•and a strange light flashing in his filmy eyes. 

“ What are you waiting for ? 99 asked Bintrey. 

Obenreizer pointed' to the brown door. “Call them 
back,” he answered. “I have something to say in their 
presence before I go.” 

ff Say it in my presence,” retorted Bintrey. “ I decline 
to call them back.” 

i Obenreizer turned to Maitre Voigt.. “ Do you remember

telling tne that you once had an English 'client naiaM Yen* 
dale?” he asked. 

" Well , 15 answered the notary. "And what of that? ” 

" Maitre Voigt, your clock-lock has betrayed you*” 

" What do you mean? ” 

"I have read the letters and certificates in your client's 
box. I have taken copies of them. I have got the copies 
here. Is there, or is there not, a reason for calling them 
back? ” 

For a moment the notary looked to and fro, between 
Obenreizer and B intrey, in helplefcs astonishment* Recov- 
ering himself, he drew his brother t-lawyer aside, and hur- 
riedly spoke a few words close at his ear. . The face of 
Bin trey — after first faithfully . reflecting the astonishment 
on the face of Maitre Yoigt — suddenly altered its expres- 
sion. He sprang, with the activity of a young man, to the 
door of the inner room, entered it, remained inside for a 
minute, and returned followed by Marguerite and Vendale. 
"Now, Mr. Obenreizery*' said Bintrey, "the last move in 
the game is yours. Play it.” • 

" Before I resign my position as that young lady's gtiar* 
dian,” said Obenreizer, " I have a secret to reveal in whufli 
she is interested. In making, my disclosure,. I am not 
claiming her attention for a. narrative which she, ot any 
other person present, is expected to take on tttist. I am 
possessed of written proofs, copied of originals, the authen- 
ticity of which Maitre Yoigt himself can attest* Bear that 
in mind, and permit me to refer you, at starting, to a date 
long past— the month of February , in the year one thou- 
sand eight hundred and thirty-six.” • 

"Mark the date, Mr* Vendale,” said Bintrey* 

"My first proof,” said Obdnreizer, taking a paper from 
his pocket+book. " Copy of d letter, written by an Eng- 
lish lady (married ) to her sister, a widow. The name, of 
the person writing the letter I shall keep suppressed Until 
I have done. The name of the person to whom the letter 
is written I am willing to reveal. Itis addressed to ‘ Mrs. 
Jane Ann Miller, of Groomsbridge Wells, England.' ” 
Vendale started, and Opened his lips to speak. Bintrey 
instantly stopped him, as he had stopped Maitre Yoigt. 
"No,” said the pertinacious lawyer* , "Leave it to me/' 
Obenreizer went on.

letter,** he said. “I ban! give the substance of it in twc 
words. The writer’s position at the time is this. She has 
been long living in Switzerland with her husband — obliged 
to live there for the sake of her husband’s health. They 
are about to move to a new residence on the Lake of Neu- 
chatel in a week, and they will be ready to receive Mrs. 
Miller as visitor in a fortnight from that time. This said, 
the writer next enters into an important domestic detail. 
She has been childless for years — she and her husband 
have now no hope of children; they are lonely; they want 
an interest in life; they have decided on adopting a child. 
Here the important part of the letter begins; and here, 
therefore, I read it to you word for word. ” He folded back 
the first page of the letter and read as follows : 

“ * * * Will you help us, my dear sister, to realise 
our new project? As English people, we wish to adopt an 
English child. This may be done, L believe, at the Found- 
ling: my husband’s lawyers in London will tell you how. 
I leave the choice to you, with only these conditions at- 
tached to it — that the child is to be an infant under a year 
old, and is to be a boy. Will you pardon the trouble I am 
giving you, for my sake; and will you bring our adopted 
child to us, with your own children, when you come to 
Neuch&tel? 

“ I must add a word to my husband’s wishes in this 
matter. He is resolved to spare the child whom we make 
our own, any future mortification and loss of self-respect 
which might be caused by a discovery of his true origin. 
He will bear my husband’s name, and he will be brought 
up in the belief that he is really our son. His inheritance 
of what we have to leave will be secured to him — not only 
according to the laws of England in such cases, but according 
to the laws of Switzerland also; for we have lived so long 
in this country that there is a doubt whether we may not 
be considered as * domiciled ’ in Switzerland. The one pre- 
caution left to take is to prevent any after-discovery at the 
Foundling. Now, our name is a very uncommon one; and 
if we appear on the Register of the Institution, as the per- 
sons adopting the child, there is just a chance that some- 
thing might result from it. Your name, my dear, is the 
name of thousands of other people; and if you will consent 
to appear on the Register, there need be no fear of any dis*

coveries in that quarter. We are moving, by the doctor’s 
orders, to a part of Switzerland in which our circumstances 
are quite unknown; and you, as I understand, are about to 
engage a new nurse for the journey when you come to see 
us. Under these circumstances, the child may appear as 
my child, brought back to me under my sister’s care. The 
only servant we take with us from our old home is my own 
maid, who can be safely trusted. As for the lawyers in 
England and in Switzerland, it is their profession to keep 
secrets — and we may feel quite easy in that direction. So 
there you have our harmless little conspiracy! Write by 
return of post; my love 1 , and tell me you will join it.” 
#..* * * * * * 

“ Do you still conceal the name of the writer of that let- 
ter? ” asked Vendale. 

“ I keep the name of the writer till the last,” answered 
Obenreizer, “ and I proceed to my second proof —a mere slip 
of paper, this time, as you see. Memorandum given to 
the Swiss lawyer, who drew the documents referred to in 
the letter I have just read, expressed as follows : — ‘Adopted 
from the Foundling Uospital of England, 3rd March, 1836, 
a male infant, called, in the Institution, Walter Wilding. 
Person appearing on the register, as adopting the child, 
Mrs. Jane Ann Miller, widow, acting in this matter for her 
married sister, domiciled in Switzerland- ’ Patience!” re- 
sumed Obenreizer, as Vendale, breaking loose from Bin- 
trey, started, to his feet. “I shall not keep the name con- 
cealed much longer. Two more little slips of paper, and I 
have done. Third proof ! Certificate of Doctor Ganz, still 
living in practice at Neuch&tel, dated July, 1838. The 
doctor certifies (you shall read it for yourselves directly), 
first, that he attended the adopted child in ifs infant mala- 
dies; second, that, three months before the date of the cer- 
tificate, the gentleman adopting the child as his son died; 
third, that on the. date of the certificate, his widow and her 
maid, taking the adopted child with them, left Neuch&tel on 
their return to England. One more link now added to this, 
and my chain of evidence is complete. The maid remained 
with her mistress till her mistress’s death, only a few years 
since. The maid can swear tathe identity of the adopted in- 
fant, from his childhood to his youth — from his youth to his 
manhood, as he is now* There is her address in England 
— and ther^, Mj% Vendale, is the fourth, and final proof ! ”

14 Why do you address yourself to me? v said Vendale, 
as Obenreizer threw the written address on the table. 

' Obenreizer turned on him, in a sudden frenzy of tri- 
umph. 

“ Became you are the man / If my niece marries you, 
rfhe marries a bastard, brought up by public charily. II 
niy niece marries you, she marries an impostor, without 
name or lineage, disguised in the character of a gentleman 
of rank and family.” 

Bravo!” cried Bintrey. 44 Admirably put, Mr. Oben- 
reizer ! It only wants one word more to oomplete it. She 
marries — thanks entirely to your exertions— a man who in- 
herits a handsome fortune, and a man whose origin will 
iriake him prouder than ever of his peasant- wife. George 
Vendale, as brother-executors, let us congratulate each 
other! Our dear dead friend’s last wish on earth is accom- 
plished. We have found the lost Walter Wilding. As 
Mr. Obenreizer said just now — you are the man ! ” 

The words passed by Vendale unheeded. For the mo- 
ment he was conscious of but one sensation; he heard but 
one voice. Marguerite’s hand was clasping his. Margue- 
rite’s voice was whispering to him: 44 1 never loved you, 
George, as I love you now ! ” 

THE CURTAIN PAULS. 

May-Bay. There is merry-making in Cripple Comer, 
the chimneys smoke, the patriarchal dining-hall is hung 
with garlands, and Mrs. Goldstraw ? the respected house- 
keeper, is very busy. For, on this bright morning the 
young master of Cripple Corner is married to its young 
mistress, far away : to wit, in the little town of Brieg, in 
Switzerland, lying at the foot of the Simplon Pass where 
she saved his life. 

The bells ring gaily in the little town of Brieg, and flags 
are. stretched across the' street, and rifle shots are heard, 
and sounding music from hnass instruments. Streamer- 
decorated casks of wine; ha^e bfcen rolled out under a gay 
awning in the public w>ay before the Inn, and there will be 
free feasting and revelry.' Wfa&t with bells and banners, 
draperies hanging from Wiiiddws, explosion of gunpowder, 
and reverberation of brass muBki, the little town of Brieg is 
all in a flutter, like the hearts of its simple people.

It Was a Stormy night last nighty and th 4 mountain fe are 
covered with snow. But the sun is bright to-day. the 
sweet ail is fresh, the tin spires of the little town of Brieg 
are burnished silver, and the Alps are ranges of far-off 
white Cloud in a deep blue sky. - 

The primitive people of the little town of Brieg have 
built a greenwood arch across the street, under which the 
neWly married pair shall pass in triumph from the church. 
It is inscribed, on that side, “ Honour ajtd Lovfi to Mar- 
guerite Vekdale ! ” for the people are proud of her to 
enthusiasm. This greeting of the bride under her new 
name is affectionately meant as a Surprise, and therefore 
the arrangement has been made that shO, uncdnsdiotts why, 
shall be taken to the church by a tortuous back wav, A 
little scheme not difficult to carry into execution in the 
crooked little town of Brieg. 

80, all things are in readiness, and they are to go and 
come on f oot. Assembled in the Inn’s ' best chamber, f es- 
tively adorned, are the bride and bridegroom, the NeuchA- 
tel notary, the London lawyer, Madame Dor, and a certain 
large mysterious Englishman, popularly known as MonsierUf 
Zho&Ladelle. And behold Madame Dor, arrayed in a 
spotless pair of gloves of her owii, With no hand in the air, 
but both hands clasped round the neck of the bride? to em- 
brace whom Madame Dor has turned her broad baek on the 
company, consistent to the last* 

“ Forgive me, my beautiful,?’ pleads Madame Dor, “for 
that I ever was his she-cat!” 

“ She-cat, Madame Dor? ” 

“Engaged to sit watching my so charming mouse,” are 
the explanatory words of Madame Dor, delivered with a 
penitential sob. 

“ Why, you were our best friend I George, dearest, tell 
Madame Dor. Was she not Our best friend? ” 

“Undoubtedly, darling. What should we have done 
without her?” f 

“You are both so generous,” cries Madame Dot, accept- 
ing consolation, and immediately relapsing. “ But I Com- 
menced as a she-cat.” » ' * * ! '• 

“ Ah ! But like the cat in the fairy-story, good Madame 
Dor,” says Vendale, saluting her cbeeki, “you Were a true 
woman. And, being a true woman, the sympathy of your 
heart was with true love,”

the other steadfastly regards him :

“ He arrived at our Hospice the day before yesterday, 
and, having refreshed himself with sleep on the floor be- 
fore the fire, wrapped in his cloak, was resolute to go on, 
before dark, to the next Hospice. He had a great fear of

thing to bring the litter through the arch across the street, 
until Madame has passed through. As you descend, we 
who accompany the litter will set it down on the stones of 
the street the second to the right, and will stand before it. 
But do not let Madame turn her head towards the street 
the second to the right. There is no time to lose. Madame 
will be alarmed by your absence. Adieu ! ” 

Vendale returns to his bride, and draws her hand through 
his unmaimed arm. A pretty procession awaits them at 
the main door of the church. They take their station in 
it, and descend the street amidst the ringing of the bells, 
the firing of the guns, the waving of the flags, the playing 
of the music, the shouts, the smiles, and tears, of the ex- 
cited town. Heads are uncovered as she passes, hands are 
kissed to her, all the people bless her. “Heaven’s bene- 
diction on the dear girl ! See where she goes in her youth 
and beauty; she who so nobly saved his life ! ” 

Near the comer of the street the second to the right, he 
speaks to her, and calls her attention to the windows on 
the opposite side. The comer well passed, he says : “ Do 
not look round, my darling, for a reason that I have,” and 
turns his head. Then, looking back along the street, he 
sees the litter and its bearers passing up alone under the 
arch, as he and she and their marriage train go down towards 
the shining valley.

NOTES ON NO THOROUGHFARE. 


This, the last of Dickens’s Christmas stories, is in the 
present edition placed for convenience in a volume apart 
from that series. It has been surmised that Dickens took 
the title of this story from the notice-boards which were 
put up at points where private roads or foot-paths abut on 
public roads away from Cobham Park, not far from his 
Gadshill residence. The story, which consists of an Over- 
ture and Pour Acts, was composed by Dickens and Wilkie 
Collins, each contributing an equal part. Dickens was 
responsible for the Overture, portions of the First and 
Fourth Acts, and the whole of Act III. 

During Dickens’s absence in America (1867-68), Wilkie 
Collins transformed “No Thoroughfare” into a play for 
Fechter, with a view to which it had been originally 
planned; it was first published in 1867, and is very scarce 
in this form. In an unpublished letter to the late Fred 
Chapman (of Chapman and Hall), dated May 11th, 1873, 
Collins recalled (as far as he was able) the exact nature 
of his collaboration with Dickens, and thus wrote: 

u It is impossible for me to indicate correctly my share 
in the Acts jointly written (I. and IV.) — we purposely 
wrote so as to make discoveries of this difficult, if not im- 
possible. I inserted passages in his chapters and he in- 
serted passages in mine. I can only tell you that we as 
nearly as possible halved the work. We put the story 
together in the Swiss chalet at Gadshill and we finished 
the Fourth Act side by side at two desks in his bedroom 
at Gadshill. 

“ As everything connected with his writing is part of the 
literary historv of England, I may add that the Scenes 
and Acts of the dramatic version of this story were ar- 
ranged by Dickens and Fechter, while I was engaged in

completing a work of my own. The ‘scenario' was then 
placed in my hands, and the Drama was entirely written 
by me." 

The drama is divided into five Acts, and the incidents 
are presented somewhat differently/rom the original tale. 
It w£s probated the* Ailfelphi'Theatre* during Dickens's 
absence in the United States, being first performed on 
Boxing Night of 1867, with Fechter as Obenreizer, Ben- 
jamin Webster as Joey Ladle, and MJss Carlotta Leclercq 
as Marguerite. ! ‘ ! , . ' / 

It seems that, when engaged upon this romance, the 
authors departed from the usual custom of English 
writers, inasmuch as they framed the plot and created the 
charpenterie of the work with the undisguised object of 
making it a stage play, after having first published it in the 
form of a novel. The popularity of “ No Thoroughfare" at 
the Adelphi, and subsequently in Paris and America, was 
beyond all question. Dickens, however, did not at first 
feel assured of its success, being “ reduced to the confines 
of despair by its length," and if he could have rehearsed it 
he would “have taken the best part of an hour out of it." 
He therefore experienced considerable delight in receiving 
intimations from England of its very favourable reception, 
both by the public and the press, thanks, for the most part, 
to Fechter ’s superb acting. 

Much to Dickens’s annoyance, the “pirates" were busy 
with the plav in America within ten days of the arrival 
there of the Christmas Number of “All the Year Round," 
and mangled versions were given everywhere, threats of 
injunctions notwithstanding. As a matter of fact, it was 
doubtful whether Dickens could have prevented this whole- 
sale infringement of his rights, for, as he wrote to Fechter, 
“ Why should they pay for the piece as you act it, when 
they have no actors, and when all they want is my name, 
and they can get that for nothing?" 

“No Thoroughfare" waj translated into French for 
representation at the Paris Vaudeville Theatre, when it 
appeared as “L’Abime. v ’ Dickens went to the French 
Capital for the express purpose of superintending the

rehearsals, and assisting at the first performances, whence 
he returned highly pleased with its success in this form. 
The play was printed by a New York publisher, 1868 
(pp. 40), with the following title: 

“ No Thoroughfare. A Drama. In five Acts and a 
Prologue. By Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins. As 
first performed at the New Royal Adelphi Theatre, Lon- 
don, December 26th, 1867. New York: Robert M. de 
Witt, Publisher, No. 33, Rose Street.” 

In January, 1868, an unauthorised version, entitled 
“Identity; or, No Thoroughfare,” by Louis Lequel, was 
performed at Conway’s Park Theatre, Brooklyn, N. Y.
