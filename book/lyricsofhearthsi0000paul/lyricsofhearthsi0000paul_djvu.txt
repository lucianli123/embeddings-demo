LOVE’S APOTHEOSIS. 


OVE me. I care not what the circling years 
To me may do. 
If, but in spite of time and tears, 
You prove but true. 


Love me — albeit grief shall dim mine eyes, 
And tears bedew, 

I shall not e’en complain, for then my skies 
Shall still be blue. 


Love me, and though the winter snow shall pile, 
And leave me chill, 
Thy passion’s warmth shall make for me, mean- 
while, 
A sun-kissed hill. 
I I 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


And when the days have lengthened into years, 
And I grow old, 
Oh, spite of pains and griefs and cares and 
fears, 
Grow thou not cold. 


Then hand and hand we shall pass up the hill, 
I say not down ; 
That twain go up, of love, who’ve loved their 
fill, — 
To gain love’s crown. 


Love me, and let my life take up thine own, 
As sun the dew. 

Come, sit, my queen, for in my heart a throne 
Awaits for you! 


The Paradox. 


THE PARADOX. 


AM the mother of sorrows, 
I am the ender of grief; 
I am the bud and the blossom, 
I am the late-falling leaf. 


I am thy priest and thy poet, 
I am thy serf and thy king ; 

I cure the tears of the heartsick, 
When I come near they shall sing. 


White are my hands as the snow-drop ; 
Swart are my fingers as clay ; 

Dark is my frown as the midnight, 
Fair is my brow as the day. 


Battle and war are my minions, 
Doing my will as divine ; 

I am the calmer of passions, 
Peace is a nursling of mine.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Speak to me gently or curse me, 
Seek me or fly from my sight ; 

I am thy fool in the morning, 
Thou art my slave in the night. 


Down to the grave will I take thee, 
Out from the noise of the strife s 
Then shalt thou see me and know me — 
Death, then, no longer, but life. 


Then shalt thou sing at my coming, 
Kiss me with passionate breath, 

Clasp me and smile to have thought me 
Aught save the foeman of Death. 


Come to me, brother, when weary, 
Come when thy lonely heart swells ; 
I’ll guide thy footsteps and lead thee 
Down where the Dream Woman dwells, 


Over the Hills. 


OVER-THE. HILLS... 


VER the hills and the valleys of dreaming 
Slowly I take my way. 
Life is the night with its dream-visions teeming, 
Death is the waking at day. 


Down thro’ the dales and the bowers of loving, 
Singing, I roam afar. 

Daytime or night-time, I constantly roving, — 
Dearest one, thou art my star.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


WITH THE LARK. 


IGHT is for sorrow and dawn is for joy, 
Chasing the troubles that fret and annoy ; 
Darkness for sighing and daylight for song, — 
Cheery and chaste the strain, heartfelt and 


strong. 
All the night through, though I moan in the 
dark, 


I wake in the morning to sing with the lark. 


Deep in the midnight the rain whips the leaves, 

Softly and sadly the wood-spirit grieves. 

But when the first hue of dawn tints the sky, 

I shall shake out my wings like the birds and 
be dry ; 

And though, like the rain-drops, I grieved 
through the dark, 

I shall wake in the morning to sing with the 
lark.

With the Lark. 


On the high hills of heaven, some morning to 
be, 

Where the rain shall not grieve thro’ the leaves 
of the tree, 

There my heart will be glad for the pain I have 
known, 

For my hand will be clasped in the hand of 
mine own ; 

And though life has been hard and death’s path- 
way been dark, 

I shall wake in the morning to sing with the 
lark. 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


IN SUMMER. 


H, summer has clothed the earth 
In a cloak from the loom of the sun! 
And a mantle, too, of the skies’ soft blue, 
And a belt where the rivers run. 


And now for the kiss of the wind, 
And the touch of the air’s soft hands, 
With the rest from strife and the heat of life, 
With the freedom of lakes and lands. 


a ee 


I envy the farmer’s boy 
Who sings as he follows the plow ; 

While the shining green of the young blades lean 
To the breezes that cool his brow. 


He sings to the dewy morn, 
No thought of another’s ear ; 
But the song he sings is a chant for kings 
And the whole wide world to hear. 
8 


—— 


In Summer. 


He sings of. the joys of life, 
Of the pleasures of work and rest, 

From an o’erfull heart, without aim or art ; 
’'T is a song of the merriest. 


O ye who toil in the town, 
And ye who moil in the mart, 

Hear the artless song, and your faith made strong 
Shall renew your joy of heart. 


Oh, poor were the worth of the world 
If never a song were heard, — 

If the sting of grief had no relief, 
And never a heart were stirred. 


So, long as the streams run down, 
And as long as the robins trill, 

Let us taunt old Care with a merry air, 
And sing in the face of ill. 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


THE MYSTIC SEA. 


HE smell of the sea in my nostrils, 
The sound of the sea in mine ears ; 
The touch of the spray on my burning face, 
Like the mist of reluctant tears. 


The blue of the sky above me, 
The green of the waves beneath ; 

The sun flashing down on a gray-white sail 
Like a scimitar from its sheath. 


And ever the breaking billows, 
And ever the rocks’ disdain ; 

And ever a thrill in mine inmost heart 
That my reason cannot explain. 


So I say to my heart, “ Be silent, 
The mystery of time is here ; 


Death’s way will be plain when we fathom the 


main, 
And the secret of life be clear.”

A Sailor’s Song. 


A SAILOR’S SONG. 


H for the breath of the briny deep, 
And the tug of a bellying sail, 
With the sea-gull’s cry across the sky 
And a passing boatman’s hail. 
For, be she fierce or be she gay, 
The sea is a famous friend alway. 


Ho! for the plains where the dolphins play, 
And the bend of the mast and spars, 

And a fight at night with the wild sea-sprite 
When the foam has drowned the stars. 
And, pray, what joy can the landsman feel 
Like the rise and fall of a sliding keel? 


Fair is the mead ; the lawn is fair 
And the birds sing sweet on the lea ; 
But the echo soft of a song aloft 

Iz 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Is the strain that pleases me ; 
And swish of rope and ring of chain 
Are music to men who sail the main. 


Then, if you love me, let me sail 

While a vessel dares the deep ; 

For the ship’s my wife, and the breath of life 
Are the raging gales that sweep ; 

And when I’m done with calm and blast, 

A slide o’er the side, and rest at last.

The Bohemian. 


THE BOHEMIAN. 


Bie me the livery of no other man. 
I am my own to robe me at my pleasure. 


Accepted rules to me disclose no treasure : 


What is the chief who shall my garments plan? 
No garb conventional but I’ll attack it. 
(Come, why not don my spangled jacket ?)

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


ABSENCE. 


OOD-NIGHT, my love, for I have dreamed 
of thee 

In waking dreams, until my soul is lost — 

Is lost in passion’s wide and shoreless sea, 
Where, like a ship, unruddered, it is tost 
Hither and thither at the wild waves’ will. 
There is no potent Master’s voice to still 

This newer, more tempestuous Galilee ! 


The stormy petrels of my fancy fly 

In warning course across the darkening green, 
And, like a frightened bird, my heart doth cry 
And seek to find some rock of rest between 
The threatening sky and the relentless wave, 

It is not length of life that grief doth crave, 

But only calm and peace in which to die. 


14 


_ _ rcs 


Absence. 


Here let me rest upon this single hope, 

For oh, my wings are weary of the wind, 

And with its stress no more may strive or cope. 

One cry has dulled mine ears, mine eyes are 
blind, — 

Would that o’er all the intervening space, 

I might fly forth and see thee face to face. 

I fly ; I search, but, love, in gloom I grope. 


Fly home, far bird, unto thy waiting nest ; 

Spread thy strong wings above the wind-swept 
sea. 

Beat the grim breeze with thy unruffled breast 

Until thou sittest wing to wing with me. 

Then, let the past bring up its tales of wrong ; 

We shall chant low our sweet connubial song, 

Till storm and doubt and past no more shall be ! 


15 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


HER THOUGHT AND HIS. 


HE gray of the sea, and the gray of the sky, 
A glimpse of the moon like a_half- 
closed eye. 
The gleam on the waves and the light on the 
land, 
A thrill in my heart, — and — my sweetheart’s 
hand. 


She turned from the sea with a woman’s grace, 
And the light fell soft on her upturned face, 

And I thought of the flood-tide of infinite bliss 
That would flow to my heart from a single kiss. 


But my sweetheart was shy, so I dared not ask 
For the boon, so bravely I wore the mask. 
But into her face there came a flame : — 
I wonder could she have been thinking the 
same?

The Right to Die. 


THE RIGHT TO DIE. 


HAVE no fancy for that ancient cant 

That makes us masters of our destinies, 
And not our lives, to hold or give them up 
As will directs ; I cannot, will not think 
That men, the subtle worms, who plot and plan 
And scheme and calculate with such shrewd wit, 
Are such great blund’ring fools as not to know 
When they have lived enough. 

Men court not death 

When there are sweets still left in life to taste. 
Nor will a brave man choose to live when he, 
Full deeply drunk of life, has reached the dregs, 
And knows that now but bitterness remains. 
He is the coward who, outfaced in this, 
Fears the false goblins of another life. 
I honor him who being much harassed 
Drinks of sweet courage until drunk of it, — 
Then seizing Death, reluctant, by the hand, 
Leaps with him, fearless, to eternal peace !

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


BEHIND THE ARRAS. 


S in some dim baronial hall restrained, 
A prisoner sits, engirt by secret doors 
And waving tapestries that argue forth 
Strange passages into the outer air : 
So in this dimmer room which we call life, 
Thus sits the soul and marks with eye intent 
That mystic curtain o’er the portal death ; 
Still deeming that behind the arras lies 
The lambent way that leads to lasting light. 
Poor fooled and foolish soul! Know now that 
death 
Is but a blind, false door that nowhere leads, 
And gives no hope of exit final, free.

When the Old Man Smokes. 


WHEN THE OLD MAN SMOKES. 


T the forenoon’s restful quiet, 
When the boys are off at school, 
When the window lights are shaded 
And the chimney-corner cool, 
Then the old man seeks his armchair, 
Lights his pipe and settles back ; 
Falls a-dreaming as he draws it 
Till the smoke-wreaths gather black. 


And the teardrops come a-trickling 
Down his cheeks, a silver flow — 

Smoke or memories you wonder, 
But you never ask him, — no ; 

For there ’s something almost sacred 
To the other family folks 

In those moods of silent dreaming 
When the old man smokes.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Ah, perhaps he sits there dreaming 
Of the love of other days 
And of how he used to lead her 
Through the merry dance’s maze ; 
- How he called her “little princess,” 
And, to please her, used to twine 
Tender wreaths to crown her tresses, 


From the “ matrimony vine.” 


5 


Then before his mental vision 
Comes, perhaps, a sadder day, 
When they left his little princess 
Sleeping with her fellow clay. 
How his young heart throbbed, and pained 
him ! 
Why, the memory of it chokes ! 
Is it of these things he ’s thinking 
When the old man smokes?

But some brighter thoughts possess him, 
For the tears are dried the while. 
And the old, worn face is wrinkled

When the Old Man Smokes. 


From the middle of the forehead 
To the feebly trembling lip, 

At some ancient prank remembered 
Or some long unheard-of quip. 


Then the lips relax their tension 
And the pipe begins to slide, 
Till in little clouds of ashes, 
It falls softly at his side ; 
And his head bends low and lower 
Till his chin lies on his breast, 
And he sits in peaceful slumber 
Like a little child at rest. 


Dear old man, there ’s something sad’ning, 
In these dreamy moods of yours, 
Since the present proves so fleeting, 
All the past for you endures. 
Weeping at forgotten sorrows, 
Smiling at forgotten jokes ; 
Life epitomized in minutes, 
When the old man smokes.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


THE GARRET. 


ITHIN a London garret high, 

\ Above the roofs and near the sky, 
My ill-rewarding pen I ply 

To win me bread. 
This little chamber, six by four, 
Is castle, study, den, and more, — 
Altho’ no carpet decks the floor, 

Nor down, the bed. 


My room is rather bleak and bare ; 
I only have one broken chair, 
But then, there ’s plenty of fresh air, 
Some light, beside. 
What tho’ I cannot ask my friends 
To share with me my odds and ends, 
A liberty my aerie lends, 
To most denied.

The Garret. 


The bore who falters at the stair 
No more shall be my curse and care, 
And duns shall fail to find my lair 
With beastly bills. 
When debts have grown and funds are short, 
I find it rather pleasant sport 
To live ‘‘ above the common sort” 
With all their ills. 


I write my rhymes and sing away, 
And dawn may come or dusk or day: 
Tho’ fare be poor, my heart is gay, 
And full of glee. 
Though chimney-pots be all my views ; 
’T is nearer for the winging Muse, 
So I am sure she ’ll not refuse 
To visit me.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


TO CECH. IR 
ON THE RECEIPT OF A FAMILIAR POEM. 


O me, like hauntings of a vagrant breath 
From some far forest which,I once have 
known, 

The perfume of this flower of verse is blown. 
Tho’ seemingly soul-blossoms faint to death, 
Naught that with joy ‘she bears e’er withereth. 

So, tho’ the pregnant years have come and 

flown, 

Lives come and gone and altered like mine 

own, 
This poem comes to me a shibboleth: 


Brings sound of past communings to my ear, 
Turns round the tide of time and bears me 
back 
Along an old and long untraversed way ; 
Makes me forget this is a later year, 
Makes me tread o’er a reminiscent track, 
Half sad, half glad, to one forgotten day !

A Bridal Measure. 


A BRIDAL MEASURE. 


(ae essay a sprightly measure, 
Tuned to some light song of pleasure, 


Maidens, let your brows be crowned 
As we foot this merry round. 


From the ground a voice is singing, 

From the sod a soul is springing. 
Who shall say ’tis but a clod 
Quick’ning upward toward its God? 


Who shall say it? Who may know it, 
That the clod is not a poet 

Waiting but a gleam to waken 

In a spirit music-shaken? 


Phyllis, Phyllis, why be waiting? 
In the woods the birds are mating. 
From the tree beside the wall, 
Hear the am’rous robin call. 


25 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Listen to yon thrush’s trilling ; 

Phyllis, Phyllis, are you willing, 
When love speaks from cave and tree, 
Only we should silent be? oN 

3 na 

When the year, itself renewing, 

All the world with flowers is strewing, 
Then through Youth’s Arcadian land, 


Love and song go hand in hand. 


Come, unfold your vocal treasure, 
Sing with me a nuptial measure, — 
Let this springtime gambol be 
Bridal dance for you and me.

Vengeance is Sweet. 


VENGEANCE IS SWEET. 


HEN I was young I longed for Love, 
And held his glory far above 
All other earthly things. I cried: 
«“ Come, Love, dear Love, with me abide ;” 
And with my subtlest art I wooed, 
And eagerly the wight pursued. 
But Love was gay and Love was shy, 
He laughed at me and passed me by. 


Well, I grew old and I grew gray, 

When Wealth came wending down my way. 
I took his golden hand with glee, 

And comrades from that day were we. 
Then Love came back with doleful face, 
And prayed that I would give him place. 
But, though his eyes with tears were dim, 

I turned my back and laughed at him. 


27 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


A HYMN. 
AFTER READING “ LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT.” 


EAD gently, Lord, and slow, 
For oh, my steps are weak, 
And ever as I go, 
Some soothing sentence speak ; 


That I may turn my face 
Through doubt’s obscurity 

Toward thine abiding-place, 
E’en tho’ I cannot see. 


For lo, the way is dark ; 

Through mist and cloud I grope, 
Save for that fitful spark, 
' The little flame of hope. 


Lead gently, Lord, and slow, 
For fear that I may fall ; 
I know not where to go 
Unless I hear thy call. 
28 


. 


A Hymn. 


My fainting soul doth yearn 
For thy green hills afar ; 

So let thy mercy burn — 
My greater, guiding star! 


29 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


JUST WHISTLE A BIT. 


UST whistle a bit, if the day be dark, 

] And the sky be overcast : 

If mute be the voice of the piping lark, 
Why, pipe your own small blast. 


And it’s wonderful how o’er the gray sky-track 
The truant warbler comes stealing back. 

But why need he come? for your soul’s at rest, 
And the song in the heart, — ah, that is best. 


Just whistle a bit, if the night be drear 
And the stars refuse to shine: 

And a gleam that mocks the starlight clear 
Within you glows benign. 


Till the dearth of light in the glooming skies 
Is lost to the sight of your soul-lit eyes. 
What matters the absence of moon or star? 
The light within is the best by far. 


30 


Just Whistle a Bit. 


Just whistle a bit, if there ’s work to do, 
With the mind or in the soil. 

And your note will turn out a talisman true 
To exorcise grim Toil. 


It will lighten your burden and make you feel 

That there’s nothing like work as a sauce for a 
meal, 

And with song in your heart and the meal in — 
its place, 

There ll be joy in your bosom and light in your 
face. 


Just whistle a bit, if your heart be sore ; 
’T is a wonderful balm for pain. 

Just pipe some old melody o’er and o’er 
Till it soothes like summer rain. 


And perhaps ’t would be best in a later day, 
When Death comes stalking down the way, 
To knock at your bosom and see if you’re fit, 
Then, as you wait calmly, just whistle a bit.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


THE BARRIER. 


HE Midnight wooed the Morning-Star, 
And prayed her: “ Love come nearer; 
Your swinging coldly there afar 
To me but makes you dearer!” 


The Morning-Star was pale with dole 
As said she, low replying : 

“Oh, lover mine, soul of my soul, 
For you I too am sighing.

The twain stood unaffrighted —

DREAMS. 


|B yore on, for dreams are sweet: 


Do not awaken ! 
Dream on, and at thy feet 
Pomegranates shall be shaken, 


Who likeneth the youth 
Of life to morning? 

’T is like the night in truth, 
Rose-coloured dreams adorning. 


The wind is soft above, 
The shadows umber. 

(There is a dream called Love.) 
Take thou the fullest slumber ! 


In Lethe’s soothing stream, 
Thy thirst thou slakest, 
Sleep, sleep ; ’tis sweet to dream. 
Oh, weep when thou awakest !

The Dreamer. 


THE DREAMER. 


EMPLES he built and palaces of air, 
And, with the artist’s parent-pride aglow, 
His fancy saw his vague ideals grow 
Into creations marvellously fair ; 
He set his foot upon Fame’s nether stair. 
But ah, his dream, — it had entranced him so 
He could not move. He could no farther go ; 
But paused in joy that he was even there ! 


He did not wake until one day there gleamed 
Thro’ his dark consciousness a light that 
racked 
His being till he rose, alert to act. 
But lo! what he had dreamed, the while he 
dreamed, 
Another, wedding action unto thought, 
Into the living, pulsing world had brought.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


WAITING. 


HE sun has slipped his tether 
And galloped down the west. 

(Oh, it’s weary, weary waiting, love.) 
The little bird is sleeping 

In the softness of its nest. 
Night follows day, day follows dawn, 
And so the time has come and gone: 

And it’s weary, weary waiting, love. 


The cruel wind is rising 

With a whistle and a wail. 
(And it’s weary, weary waiting, love.) 
My eyes are seaward straining 

For the coming of a sail; 

But void the sea, and void the beach 
Far and beyond where gaze can reach ! 
And it’s weary, weary waiting, love.

I heard the bell-buoy ringing — 
How long ago it seems! 
(Oh, it’s weary, weary waiting, love.) 
And ever still, its knelling 
Crashes in upon my dreams. 
The banns were read, my frock was sewn ; 
Since then two seasons’ winds have blown — 
And it’s weary, weary waiting, love. 


The stretches of the ocean 
Are bare and bleak to-day. 
(Oh, it’s weary, weary waiting, love.) 
My eyes are growing dimmer — 
Is it tears, or age, or spray? 
But I will stay till you come home. 
Strange ships come in across the foam ! 
But it’s weary, weary waiting, love.

THE END OF THE CHAPTER. 


H, yes, the chapter ends to-day ; 
We even lay the book away ; 
But oh, how sweet the moments sped 
Before the final page was read ! 


We tried to read between the lines » 
The Author’s deep-concealed designs ; 
But scant reward such search secures ; 
You saw my heart and I saw yours. 


The Master, — He who penned the page 
And bade us read it, — He is sage : 

And what he orders, you and I 

Can but obey, nor question why. 


We read together and forgot 

The world about us. Time was not. 

Unheeded and unfelt, it fled. 

We read and hardly knew we read.

The End of the Chapter. 


Until beneath a sadder sun, 

We came to know the book was done. 
Then, as our minds were but new lit, 
It dawned upon us what was writ ; 


And we were startled. In our eyes, 
Looked forth the light of great surprise. 
Then as a deep-toned tocsin tolls, 

A voice spoke forth : “ Behold your souls !” 


I do,I do. I cannot look 

Into your eyes: so close the book. 
But brought it grief or brought it bliss, 
No other page shall read like this!

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


SYMPATHY. 


KNOW what the caged bird feels, alas ! 
When the sun is bright on the upland 
slopes ; 
“When the wind stirs soft through the springing 
grass, 
And the river flows like a stream of glass ; 
When the first bird sings and the first bud 
opes, 
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals — 
I know what the caged bird feels ! 


I know why the caged bird beats his wing 
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars ; 

For he must fly back to his perch and cling 
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing ; 
And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars 
And they pulse again with a keener sting — 

I know why he beats his wing ! 


40 


—— — _———

Sympathy. 


I know why the caged bird sings, ah me, 
When his wing is bruised and his bosom 
sore, — 
When he beats his bars and he would be free ; 
It is not a carol of joy or glee, 
But a prayer that he sends from his heart’s 
deep core, 
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings — 
I know why the caged bird sings!

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


LOVE AND GRIEF. 


UT of my heart, one treach’rous winter’s 
day, 

‘I locked young Love and threw the key away. 
Grief, wandering widely, found the key, 
And hastened with it, straightway, back to me, 
With Love beside him. He unlocked the door 
And bad Love enter with him there and stay. 
And so the twain abide for evermore. 


LOVE’S CHASTENING. 


Once Love grew bold and arrogant of air, 
Proud of the youth that made him fresh and 
fair ; 
So unto Grief he spake, “‘ What right hast thou 
To part or parcel of this heart?” Grief’s brow 
Was darkened with the storm of inward strife ; 
Thrice smote he Love as only he might dare, 
And Love, pride purged, was chastened all his 
life.

Mortality. 


MORTALITY. 


SHES to ashes, dust unto dust, 

What of his loving, what of his lust? 
What of his passion, what of his pain? 
What of his poverty, what of his pride? 
Earth, the great mother, has called him again : 
Deeply he sleeps, the world’s verdict defied. 
Shall he be tried again? Shall he go free? 
Who shall the court convene? Where shall it be? 
No answer on the land, none from the sea. 
Only we know that as he did, we must : 
You with your theories, you with your trust, — 
Ashes to ashes, dust unto dust !

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


LOVE. 


LIFE was mine full of the close concern 
Of many-voiced affairs. The world sped 
fast ; 
Behind me, ever rolled a pregnant past. 
A present came equipped with lore to learn. 
Art, science, letters, in their turn, 
Each one allured me with its treasures vast ; 
And I staked all for wisdom, till at last 
Thou cam’st and taught my soul anew to yearn. 
I had not dreamed that I could turn away 
From all that men with brush and pen had 
wrought ; 
But ever since that memorable day 
When to my heart the truth of love was brought, 
I have been wholly yielded to its sway, 
And had no room for any other thought.

She Gave Mea Rose. 


SHE GAVE ME A ROSE. 


HE gave me a rose, 
And I kissed it and pressed it. 
I love her, she knows, 
And my action confessed it. 
She gave me a rose, 
And I kissed it and pressed it. 


Ah, how my heart glows, 

Could I ever have guessed it? 
It is fair to suppose 

That I might have repressed it: 
She gave me a rose, 

And I kissed it and pressed it. 


’T was a rhyme in life’s prose 

That uplifted and blest it. 
Man’s nature, who knows 

Until love comes to test it? 
She gave me a rose, 

And I kissed it and pressed it.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


‘DREAM SONG. I. 


ONG years ago, within a distant clime, 
Ere Love had touched me with his wand 
sublime, 
I dreamed of one to make my life’s calm May 
The panting passion of a summer’s day. 
And ever since, in almost sad suspense, 
I have been waiting with a soul intense 
To greet and take unto myself the beams, 
Of her, my star, the lady of my dreams. 


O Love, still longed and looked for, come to 
me, 

Be thy far home by mountain, vale, or sea. 

My yearning heart may never find its rest 

Until thou liest rapt upon my breast. 

The wind may bring its perfume from the south, 

Is it so sweet as breath from my love’s mouth? 

Oh, naught that surely is, and naught that seems 

May turn me from the lady of my dreams,

Dream Song. II. 


DREAM SONG. II. 


RAY, what can dreams avail 
To make love or to mar? 
The child within the cradle rail 
Lies dreaming of the star. 
But is the star by this beguiled 
To leave its place and seek the child? 


The poor plucked rose within its glass 
Still dreameth of the bee ; 

But, tho’ the lagging moments pass, 
Her Love she may not see. 

If dream of child and flower fail, 

Why should a maiden’s dreams prevail?

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


CHRISTMAS IN THE HEART. 


HE snow lies deep upon the ground, 
And winter’s brightness all around 

Decks bravely out the forest sere, 
With jewels of the brave old year. 
The coasting crowd upon the hill - 
With some new spirit seems to thrill ; 
And all the temple bells achime 
Ring out the glee of Christmas time. 


In happy homes the brown oak-bough 
Vies with the red-gemmed holly now ; 
And here and there, like pearls, there show 
The berries of the mistletoe. 
A sprig upon the chandelier 
Says to the maidens, “ Come not here!” 
Even the pauper of the earth 
Some kindly gift has cheered to mirth!

Christmas in the Heart. 


Within his chamber, dim and cold, 

There sits a grasping miser old. 

He has no thought save one of gain, — 

To grind and gather and grasp and drain. 
A peal of bells, a merry shout 

Assail his ear: he gazes out 

Upon a world to him all gray, 

And snarls, “Why, this is Christmas Day!” 


No, man of ice, — for shame, for shame ! 
For “Christmas Day” is no mere name. 
No, not for you this ringing cheer, 

This festal season of the year. 

And not for you the chime of bells 
From holy temple rolls and swells. 

In day and deed he has no part — 

Who holds not Christmas in his heart ! 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


THE KING IS DEAD. 


\ YE, lay him in his grave, the old dead 
year ! 


His life is lived — fulfilled his destiny. 
Have you for him no sad, regretful tear 
To drop beside the cold, unfollowed bier? 
Can you not pay the tribute of a sigh P 


Was he not kind to you, this dead old year? 

Did he not give enough of earthly store? 

Enough of love, and laughter, and good cheer? 

Have not the skies you scanned sometimes been 
clear? 

How, then, of him who dies, could you ask 
more Pp 


It is not well to hate him for the pain 
He brought you, and the sorrows manifold, 
To pardon him these hurts still I am fain ;

The King is Dead. 


For in the panting period of his reign, 
He brought me new wounds, but he healed the 
old. 


One little sigh for thee, my poor, dead friend — 
One little sigh while my companions sing. 
Thou art so soon forgotten in the end ; 

We cry e’en as thy footsteps downward tend: 
“The king is dead! long live the king!”

SHE TOLD HER BEADS. 


HE told her beads with downcast eyes, 

S Within the ancient chapel dim ; 

And ever as her fingers slim 

Slipt o’er th’ insensate ivories, 

My rapt soul followed, spaniel-wise. 

Ah, many were the beads she wore ; 

But as she told them o’er and o’er, 

They did not number all my sighs, 

My heart was filled with unvoiced cries 
And prayers and pleadings unexpressed ; 
But while I burned with Love’s unrest, 

She told her beads with downcast eyes.

LITTLE LUCY LANDMAN. 


H, the day has set me dreaming 
In a strange, half solemn way 
Of the feelings I experienced 
On another long past day, — 
Of the way my heart made music 
When the buds began to blow, 
And o’ little Lucy Landman 
Whom I loved long years ago. 


It’s in spring, the poet tells us, 
That we turn to thoughts of love, 
And our hearts go out a-wooing 
With the lapwing and the dove. 
But whene’er the soul goes seeking 
Its twin-soul, upon the wing, 
I’ve a notion, backed by mem’ry, 
That it’s love that makes the spring.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


I have heard a robin singing 
When the boughs were brown and bare, 
And the chilling hand of winter 
Scattered jewels through the air. 
And in spite of dates and seasons, 
It was always spring, I know, 
When I loved Lucy Landmar 
In the days of long ago. 


Ah, my little Lucy Landman, 
I remember you as well 
As if ’t were only yesterday 
I strove your thoughts to tell, — 
When I tilted back your bonnet, 
Looked into your eyes so true, 
Just to see if you were loving 
Me as I was loving you. 


Ah, my little Lucy Landman 
It is true it was denied 
You should see a fuller summer 
And an autumn by my side.

Little Lucy Landman. 


But the glance of love’s sweet sunlight 
Which your eyes that morning gave 

Has kept spring within my bosom, 
Though you lie within the grave.

THE GOURD. 


N the heavy earth the miner 

I Toiled and laboured day by day, 

Wrenching from the miser mountain 
Brilliant treasure where it lay. 

And the artist worn and weary 
Wrought with labour manifold 

That the king might drink his nectar 
From a goblet made of gold. 


On the prince’s groaning table 
Mid the silver gleaming bright 
Mirroring the happy faces 
Giving back the flaming light, 
Shine the cups of priceless crystal 
Chased with many a lovely line, 
Glowing now with warmer colour, 
Crimsoned by the ruby wine.

In a valley sweet with sunlight, 
Fertile with the dew and rain, 
Without miner’s daily labour, 
Without artist’s nightly pain, 
There there grows the cup I drink from, 
Summer’s sweetness in it stored, 
And my lips pronounce a blessing 
As they touch an old brown gourd. 


Why, the miracle at Cana 
In the land of Galilee, 
Tho’ it puzzles all the scholars, 
Is no longer strange to me. 
For the poorest and the humblest 
Could a priceless wine afford, 
If they ’d only dip up water 
With a sunlight-seasoned gourd. 


So a health to my old comrade, 
And a song of praise to sing 
When he rests inviting kisses 
In his place beside the spring.

So, foeman, clear the path ! 


He prances off at a goodly pace ; 
'T is a noble steed he rides, 
That bears as well in the speedy race 
As he bears in battle-tides. 
What tho’ ’tis but a rocking-chair 
That prances with this stately air? 
’T is a warrior bold 
The reins doth hold, 
Who bids all foes beware !

Thou art my life, by thee I live, 
From thee proceed the joys I know; 
Sweetheart, thy hand has power to give 
The meed of love — the cup of woe. 


Thou art my love, by thee I lead 
My soul the paths of light along, 
From vale to vale, from mead to mead, q 
And home it in the hills of song.

The Phantom Kiss. 


THE PHANTOM KISS. 


NE night in my room, still and beamless, 
With will and with thought in eclipse, 
I rested in sleep that was dreamless ; 
When softly there fell on my lips 


A touch, as of lips that were pressing 
Mine own with the message of bliss — 
A sudden, soft, fleeting caressing, 
A breath like a maiden’s first kiss. 


I woke — and the scoffer may doubt me — 
I peered in surprise through the gloom ; 
But nothing and none were about me, 
And I was alone in my room. 


Perhaps ’t was the wind that caressed me 
And touched me with dew-laden breath ; 
Or, maybe, close-sweeping, there passed me 
The low-winging Angel of Death. 
Ls 65 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Some sceptic may choose to disdain it, 
Or one feign to read it aright ; 

Or wisdom may seek to explain it— 
This mystical kiss in the night. 


But rather let fancy thus clear it: 
That, thinking of me here alone, 

The miles were made naught, and, in spirit, 
Thy lips, love, were laid on mine own.

Communion. 


COMMUNION. 


T the silence of my heart, 

I will spend an hour with thee, 
When my love shall rend apart 

All the veil of mystery : 


All that dim and misty veil 
That shut in between our souls 

When Death cried, “ Ho, maiden, hail!” 
‘And your barque sped on the shoals. 


On the shoals? Nay, wrongly said. 
On the breeze of Death that sweeps 
Far from life, thy soul has sped 
Out into unsounded deeps. 


I shall take an hour and come 
Sailing, darling, to thy side. 
Wind nor sea may keep me from 
Soft communings with my bride. 
67 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


I shall rest my head on thee 
As I did long days of yore, 
When a calm, untroubled sea 
Rocked thy vessel at the shore. 


I shall take thy hand in mine, 
And live o’er the olden days 

When thy smile to me was wine, — 
Golden wine thy word of praise, 


For the carols I had wrought 
In my soul’s simplicity ; 

For the petty beads of thought 
Which thine eyes alone could see. 


Ah, those eyes, love-blind, but keen 
For my welfare and my weal ! 

Tho’ the grave-door shut between, 
Still their love-lights o’er me steal, 


I can see thee thro’ my tears, 
As thro’ rain we see the sun. 
What tho’ cold and cooling years 
Shall their bitter courses run, — - 
68 


Communion. 


I shall see thee still and be 
Thy true lover evermore, 

And thy face shall.be to me 
Dear and helpful as before. 


Death may vaunt and Death may boast, 
But we laugh his pow’r to scorn ; 
He is but a slave at most, — 
Night that heralds coming morn. 


I shall spend an hour with thee 
Day by day, my little bride. 
True love laughs at mystery, 
Crying, “ Doors of Death, fly wide.”

N Life’s Red Sea with faith I plant my feet, 
And wait the sound of that sustaining 
word 
Which long ago the men of Israel heard, 

When Pharaoh’s host behind them, fierce and 

fleet, 

Raged on, consuming with revengeful heat. 
Why are the barrier waters still unstirred >— 
That struggling faith may die of hope de- 

ferred ? 

Is God not sitting in His ancient seat? 


The billows swirl above my trembling limbs, 
And almost chill my anxious heart to doubt 
And disbelief, long conquered and defied. 
But tho’ the music of my hopeful hymns 
Is drowned by curses of the raging rout, 
No voice yet bids th’ opposing waves 
divide !

N this old garden, fair, I walk to-day 
Heart-charmed with all the beauty of the

The rich, luxuriant grasses’ cooling green, 
The wall’s environ, ivy-decked and gray, 
The waving branches with the wind at play, 
The slight and tremulous blooms that show 
between, 
Sweet all: and yet my yearning heart doth 
lean 
Toward Love’s Egyptian flesh-pots far away. 


Beside the wall, the slim Laburnum grows 
And flings its golden flow’rs to every breeze. 
But e’en among such soothing sights as 
these, 
I pant and nurse my soul-devouring woes. 
Of all the longings that our hearts wot of, 
There is no hunger like the want of love!

THE CRISIS 


MAN of low degree was sore oppressed, 
A Fate held him under iron-handed sway, 
And ever, those who saw him thus distressed 
Would bid him bend his stubborn will and 
pray. 
But he, strong in himself and obdurate, 
Waged, prayerless, on his losing fight with 
Fate. 


Friends gave his proffered hand their coldest 
clasp, 
Or took it not at all; and Poverty, 
That bruised his body with relentless grasp, 
Grinned, taunting, when he struggled to be 
free, 
But though with helpless hands he beat the air, 
His need extreme yet found no voice in prayer

_ The Crisis. 


Then he prevailed; and forthwith snobbish 
Fate, 
Like some whipped cur, came fawning at 
his feet ; 
Those who had scorned forgave and called 
him great — 
His friends found out that friendship still 
was sweet. 
But he, once obdurate, now bowed his head 
In prayer, and trembling with its import, said : 


‘Mere human strength may stand ill-fortune’s 
frown ; 
So I prevailed, for human strength was mine ; 
But from the killing pow’r of great renown, 
Naught may protect me save a strength divine. 
Help me, O Lord, in this my trembling cause ; 
I scorn men’s curses, but I dread applause !”

THE BLACK TROOPS IN CUBA. 


OUND the wide earth, from the red field 
your valour has won, 
Blown with the breath of the far-speaking gun, 
Goes the word. 
Bravely you spoke through the battle cloud heavy 
and dun. 
Tossed though the speech toward the mist- 
hidden sun, 
The world heard. 


Hell would have shrunk from you seeking it 
fresh from the fray, 
Grim with the dust of the battle, and gray 
From the fight.

Heaven would have crowned you, with crowns

Owning you fit for the light of her day,

Far through the cycle of years and of lives that 
shall come, 
There shall speak voices long muffled and dumb, 
Out of fear. 
And through the noises of trade and the turbu- 
lent hum, 
Truth shall rise over the militant drum, 
Loud and clear 


Then on the cheek of the honester nation that 
grows, 
All for their love of you, not for your woes, 
There shall lie 
Tears that shall be to your souls as the dew to 
the rose ; 
Afterward thanks, that the present yet knows 
Not to ply!

ACK to the breast of thy mother, 
Child of the earth ! 
E’en her caress can not smother 
What thou hast done. 
Follow the trail of the westering sun 
Over the earth.

Sun, in thy worth. 
Unto a nation whose sky was as night, 
Camest thou, holily, bearing thy light: 
And the dawn came, 
In it thy fame 
Flashed up in a flame. 


Back to the breast of thy mother — 
To rest. 
Long hast thou striven ;

Alexander Crummell — Dead. 


Dared where the hills by the lightning of heaven 
were riven ; 

Go now, pure shriven. 

Who shall come after thee, out of the clay — 

Learned one and leader to show us the way? 

Who shall rise up when the world gives the test? 

Think thou no more of this — 

Rest !

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


WHEN ALL IS DONE. 


HEN all is done, and my last word is 
said, 
And ye who loved me murmur, “ He is dead,” 
Let no one weep, for fear that I should know, 
And sorrow too that ye should sorrow so. 


When all is done and in the oozing clay, 
Ye lay this cast-off hull of mine away, 
Pray not for me, for, after long despair, 
The quiet of the grave will be a prayer. 


For I have suffered loss and grievous pain, 
The hurts of hatred and the world’s disdain, 
And wounds so deep that love, well-tried and 
pure, 
Had not the pow’r to ease them or to cure.

When All is Done. 


When all is done, say not my day is o’er, 

And that thro’ night I seek a dimmer shore: 

Say rather that my morn has just begun, — 

I greet the dawn and not a setting sun, 
When all is done.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


THE POET AND THE BABY. 


OW’S a man to write a sonnet, can you 
tell, — 
How’s he going to weave the dim, poetic 
spell, — 
When a-toddling on the floor 
Is the muse he must adore, 
And this muse he loves, not wisely, but too 
well? 


Now, to write a sonnet, every one allows, 
One must always be as quiet as a mouse ; 
But to write one seems to me 
Quite superfluous to be, 
When you ’ve got a little sonnet in the house. 


Just a dainty little poem, true and fine, 
That is full of love and life in every line, 
Earnest, delicate, and sweet, 
Altogether so complete 
That I wonder what’s the use of writing mine.

THE SUM. 


LITTLE dreaming by the way, 
A A little toiling day by day ; 
A little pain, a little strife, 
A little joy, — and that is life. 


A little short-lived summer’s morn, 
When joy seems all so newly born, 
When one day’s sky is blue above, 
And one bird sings, — and that is love, 


A little sickening of the years, 

The tribute of a few hot tears 

Two folded hands, the failing breath, 
And peace at last, — and that is death. 


Just dreaming, loving, dying so, 

The actors in the drama go— 

A flitting picture on a wall, 

Love, Death, the themes 3 but is that all?

SONNET. 


ON AN OLD BOOK WITH UNCUT LEAVES. 


| goer of blasted hope and lost desire, 
No finger ever traced thy yellow page 
Save Time’s. Thou hast not wrought to 
noble rage 
The hearts thou wouldst have stirred. Not any 
fire 
Save sad flames set to light a funeral pyre 
Dost thou suggest. Nay, — impotent in age, 
Unsought, thou holdst a corner of the stage 
And ceasest even dumbly to aspire. 


How different was the thought of him that writ. 
What promised he to love of ease and wealth, 
When men should read and kindle at his wit. 
But here decay eats up the book by stealth, 
While it, like some old maiden, solemnly, 
Hugs its incongruous virginity !

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


ON THE SEA WALL. 


SIT upon the old sea wall, 
And watch the shimmering sea, 
Where soft and white the moonbeams fall, 
Till, in a fantasy, 
Some pure white maiden’s funeral pall 
The strange light seems to me. 


The waters break upon the shore 
And shiver at my feet, 

While I dream old dreams o’er and o’er, 
And dim old scenes repeat ; 

Tho’ all have dreamed the same before, 
They still seem new and sweet. 


The waves still sing the same old song 
That knew an elder time ; 
The breakers’ beat is not more strong, 
Their music more sublime ; 
And poets thro’ the ages long 
Have set these notes to rhyme, 
84 


| On the Sea Wall. 


But this shall not deter my lyre, 
Nor check my simple strain ; 

If I have not the old-time fire, 
I know the ancient pain: 

The hurt of unfulfilled desire, — 
The ember quenched by rain. 


I know the softly shining sea 
That rolls this gentle swell 

Has snarled and licked its tongues at me 
And bared its fangs as well ; 

That ’neath its smile so heavenly, 
There lurks the scowl of hell ! 


But what of that? I strike my string 
(For songs in youth are sweet) ; 

I’ll wait and hear the waters bring 
Their loud resounding beat ; 

Then, in her own bold numbers sing 
The Ocean’s dear deceit !

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


TO A LADY PLAYING THE HARP. 


HY tones are silver melted into sound, 
And as I dream 
I see no walls around, 
But seem to hear 
A gondolier 
Sing sweetly down some slow Venetian stream. 


Italian skies — that I have never seen — 
I see above. 
(Ah, play again, my queen ; 
Thy fingers white 
Fly swift and light 
And weave for me the golden mesh of love.) 


Oh, thou dusk sorceress of the dusky eyes 
And soft dark hair, 
"Tis thou that mak’st my skies 
86 


Toa Lady Playing the Harp. 


So swift to change 
-To far and strange ; 
But far and strange, thou still dost make them 
fair. | 


Now thou dost sing, and I am lost in thee 
As one who drowns 

{n floods of melody. 
Still in thy art 
Give me this part, 

Till perfect love, the love of loving crowns.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


MISAPPREHENSION. 


UT of my heart, one day, I wrote a song, 
With my heart’s blood imbued, 
Instinct with passion, tremulously strong, 
With grief subdued ; 
Breathing a fortitude 
Pain-bought. 
And one who claimed much love for what I 
wrought, 
Read and considered it, 
And spoke: 
“Ay, brother, — tis well writ, 
But where ’s the joke?”

Prometheus. 


PROMETHEUS. 


ROMETHEUS stole from Heaven the sacred 
fire 
And swept to earth with it o’er land and sea. 
He lit the vestal flames of poesy, 
Content, for this, to brave celestial ire. 


Wroth were the gods, and with eternal hate 
Pursued the fearless one who ravished Heaven 
That earth might hold in fee the perfect leaven 

To lift men’s souls above their low estate. 


But judge you now, when poets wield the pen, 
Think you not well the wrong has been re- 


paired? 
’T was all in vain that ill Prometheus fared : 


The fire has been returned to Heaven again !

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


We have no singers like the ones whose note 
Gave challenge to the noblest warbler’s song. 
We have no voice so mellow, sweet, and strong 

As that which broke from Shelley’s golden throat. 


The measure of our songs is our desires : 
We tinkle where old poets used to storm. 
We lack their substance tho’ we keep their 
form : 
We strum our banjo-strings and call them lyres.

LOVE’S PHASES. 


OVE hath the wings of the butterfly, 
Oh, clasp him but gently, 
Pausing and dipping and fluttering by 
Inconsequently. ; 
Stir not his poise with the breath of a sigh; 
Love hath the wings of the butterfly. 


Love hath the wings of the eagle bold, 
Cling to him strongly — 
What if the look of the world be cold, 
And life go wrongly? 
Rest on his pinions, for broad is their fold ; 
Love hath the wings of the eagle bold. 


Love hath the voice of the nightingale, 
Hearken his trilling — 
List to his song when the moonlight is pale,— 
Passionate, thrilling.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Cherish the lay, ere the lilt of it fail H 
Love hath the voice of the nightingale. 


Love hath the voice of the storm at night, 
Wildly defiant. 

Hear him and yield up your sou! to his might, 
Tenderly pliant. 

None shall regret him who heed him aright : 

Love hath the voice of the storm at night.

For the Man who Fails. 


FOR THE MAN WHO PAILS. 


HE world is a snob, and the man who wins 
Is the chap for its money’s worth : 

And the lust for success causes half of the sins 
That are cursing this brave old earth. 

For it’s fine to go up, and the world’s applause 
Is sweet to the mortal ear ; 

But the man who fails in a noble cause 
Is a hero that’s no less dear. 


'T is true enough that the laurel crown 
Twines but for the victor’s brow ; 

For many a hero has lain him down 
With naught but the cypress bough. 
There are gallant men in the losing fight, 
And as gallant deeds are done 
As ever graced the captured height 

Or the battle grandly won.

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 
We sit at life’s board with our nerves highstrung, 
And we play for the stake of Fame, 
And our odes are sung and our banners hung 
For the man who wins the game. 
But I have a song of another kind 
Than breathes in these fame-wrought gales, — 
An ode to the noble heart and mind 
Of the gallant man who fails ! 


The man who is strong to fight his fight, 
And whose will no front can daunt, 

If the truth be truth and the right be right, 
Is the man that the ages want. 

Tho’ he fail and die in grim defeat, 
Yet he has not fled the strife, 

And the house of Earth will seem more sweet 
For the perfume of his life.

Harriet Beecher Stowe. 


HARRIET BEECHER STOWE. 


HE told the story, and the whole world wept 
At wrongs and cruelties it had not known 

But for this fearless woman’s voice alone. 

She spoke to consciences that long had slept: 

Her message, Freedom’s clear reveille, swept 
From heedless hovel to complacent throne. 
Command and prophecy were in the tone 
And from its sheath the sword of justice leapt. 

Around two peoples swelled a fiery wave, 

But both came forth transfigured from the 
flame. 

Blest be the hand that dared be strong to save, 
And blest be she who in our weakness came — 
Prophet and priestess ! At one stroke she gave 
A race to freedom and herself to fame.

VAGRANTS. 


ONG time ago, we two set out, 

My soul and I. 

I know not why, 
For all our way was dim with doubt. 

I know not where 

We two may fare: 
Though still with every changing weather, 
We wander, groping on together. 


We do not love, we are not friends, 
My soul and I. 
He lives a lie ; 
Untruth lines every way he wends. 
A scoffer he 
Who jeers at me: 
And so, my comrade and my brother, 
We wander on and hate each other.

And I made way, hope made life fragrant: 
But no. We wander, aimless, vagrant !

: 


A WINTER’S DAY. 


CROSS the hills and down the narrow ways, 
And up the valley where the free winds 
sweep, 
The earth is folded in an ermined sleep 
That mocks the melting mirth of myriad Mays. 
Departed her disheartening duns and grays, 
And all her crusty black is covered deep. 
Dark streams are locked in Winter’s donjon- 
keep, 
And made to shine with keen, unwonted rays. 


O icy mantle, and deceitful snow ! 
What world-old liars in your hearts ye are ! 
Are there not still the darkened seam and scar 
Beneath the brightness that you fain would show? 
Come from the cover with thy blot and blur, 
O reeking Earth, thou whited sepulchre !

MY LITTLE MARCH GIRL. 


OME to the pane, draw the curtain apart, 

There she is passing, the girl of my heart ; 
See where she walks like a queen in the street, 
Weather-defying, calm, placid and sweet. 
Tripping along with impetuous grace, 
Joy of her life beaming out of her face, 
Tresses all truant-like, curl upon curl, 
Wind-blown and rosy, my little March girl. 


Hint of the violet’s delicate bloom, 
Hint of the rose’s pervading perfume ! 
How can the wind help from kissing her face,— 
Wrapping her round in his stormy embrace? 
But still serenely she laughs at his rout, 
She is the victor who wins in the bout. 
So may life’s passions about her soul swirl, 
Leaving it placid,— my little March girl.

What self-possession looks out of her eyes ! 

What are the wild winds, and what are the skies, 

Frowning and glooming when, brimming with 
life, 

Cometh the little maid ripe for the strife? 

Ah! Wind, and bah! Wind, what might have 
you now? 

What can you do with that innocent brow? 

Blow, Wind, and grow, Wind, and eddy and 
swirl, 

But bring her to me, Wind,— my little March

HE sang, and I listened the whole song thro’. 
(It was sweet, so sweet, the singing.) 
The stars were out and the moon it grew 
From a wee soft glimmer way out in the blue 
To a bird thro’ the heavens winging. 


She sang, and the song trembled down to my 
breast, — 
(It was sweet, so sweet the singing.) 
As a dove just out of its fledgling nest, 
And, putting its wings to the first sweet test, 
Flutters homeward so wearily winging. 


She sang and I said to my heart, “ That song, 
That was sweet, so sweet i’ the singing, 
Shall live with us and inspire us long, 
And thou, my heart, shalt be brave and strong 
For the sake of those words a-winging.

LOVE DESPOILED. 


S lone I sat one summer’s day, 
With mien dejected, Love came by ; 
His face distraught, his locks astray, 
So slow his gait, so sad his eye, 
I hailed him with a pitying cry: 


“Pray, Love, what has disturbed thee so?” 
Said I, amazed. “Thou seem’st bereft ; 
And see thy quiver hanging low,— 
What, not a single arrow left? 
Pray, who is guilty of this theft?” 


Poor Love looked in my face and cried: 
“No thief were ever yet so bold 

To rob my quiver at my side. 
But Time, who rules, gave ear to Gold, 
And all my goodly shafts are sold.”

THE LAPSE. 


HIS poem must be done to-day ; 
Then, I’ll e’en to it. 

I must not dream my time away, — 
I’m sure to rue it. 

The day is rather bright, I know 
The Muse will pardon 

My half-defection, if I go 
Into the garden. 

It must be better working there, — ~ 
I’m sure it’s sweeter : 

And something in the balmy air 
May clear my metre. 


[ln the Garden.] 


Ah this is noble, what a sky! 
What breezes blowing ! 
The very clouds, I know not why, 
Call one to rowing.

The Lapse. 


The stream will be a paradise 
To-day, I’ll warrant. 

I know the tide that ’s on the rise 
Will seem a torrent ; 

I know just how the leafy boughs 
Are all a-quiver ; 

I know how many skiffs and scows 
Are on the river. 

I think I ’Il just go out awhile 
Before I write it ; 

When Nature shows us such a smile, 
We should n’t slight it. 

For Nature always makes desire 
By giving pleasure ; 

And so ’t will help me put more fire 
Into my measure.

Though cheques are pleasing.

THE WARRIOR'S PRAYER. 


ONG since, in sore distress, I heard one 
pray, 
“ Lord, who prevailest with resistless might, 
Ever from war and strife keep me away, 
My battles fight !” 


I know not if I play the Pharisee, 
And if my brother after all be right ; 
But mine shall be the warrior’s plea to thee — 
Strength for the fight. 


I do not ask that thou shalt front the fray, 
And drive the warring foeman from my sight ; 
I only ask, O Lord, by night, by day, 
Strength for the fight ! 


When foes upon me press, let me not quail 
Nor think to turn me into coward flight. 
I only ask, to make mine arms prevail, 
Strength for the fight!

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Still let mine eyes look ever on the foe, 
Still let mine armor case me strong and

And grant me, as I deal each righteous blow, 
Strength for the fight ! 


And when, at eventide, the fray is done, 
My soul to Death’s bedchamber do thou 
light, 
And give me, be the field or lost or won, 
Rest from the fight !

Comes nagging at the heels of Day, 

And driven faster and still faster 

Before the dusky-mantled Master, 

The light fades from her fearful eyes, 

She hastens, stumbles, falls, and dies. 


Beside me Amaryllis weeps ; 

The swelling tears obscure the deeps 
Of her dark eyes, as, mistily, 

‘The rushing rain conceals the sea. 
“Here, lay my tuneless reed away, —

THE VOICE OF THE BANJO. 


N a small and lonely cabin out of noisy 

traffic’s way, 

Sat an old man, bent and feeble, dusk of face, 
and hair of gray, 

And beside him on the table, battered, old, and 
worn as he, 

Lay a banjo, droning forth this reminiscent 
melody : 


“Night is closing in upon us, friend of mine, 
but don’t be sad ; 
Let us think of all the pleasures and the joys 
that we have had. 
Let us keep a merry visage, and be happy till 
the last, 
Let the future still be sweetened with the honey 
of the past.

“‘ For I speak to you of summer nights upon the 
yellow sand, 

When the Southern moon was sailing high and 
silvering all the land ; 

And if love tales were not sacred, there’s a tale 
that I could tell 

Of your many nightly wanderings with a dusk 
and lovely belle. 


“And I speak to you of care-free songs when 
labour’s hour was o’er, 

And a woman waiting for your step outside the 
cabin door, 

And of something roly-poly that you took upon 
your lap, 

While you listened for the stumbling, hesitating 
words, ‘ Pap, pap.’ 


“T could tell you of a ’possum hunt across the 
wooded grounds, 

I could call to mind the sweetness of the baying 
of the hounds,

Has drowned the carking devil care, 
And slumbers in his chair.

And Death may take the race we make, 
And check our gallant flight : 
But even he must play his part, 
And tho’ the look he wears be grim,

THEN AND NOW. 


THEN. 
E loved her, and through many years, 
Had paid his fair devoted court, 
Until she wearied, and with sneers 
Turned all his ardent love to sport. 


That night within his chamber lone, 

He long sat writing by his bed 

A note in which his heart made moan 
For love ; the morning found him dead. 


NOW. 


Like him, a man of later day 

Was jilted by the maid he sought, 

And from her presence turned away, 

Consumed by burning, bitter thought.

AT CHESHIRE CHEESE. 


HEN first of wise old Johnson taught, 
My youthful mind its homage brought, 
And made the pond’rous, crusty sage 
The object of a noble rage. 


Nor did I think (How dense we are !) 
That any day, however far, 

Would find me holding, unrepelled, 
The place that Doctor Johnson held ! 


But change has come and time has moved, 
And now, applauded, unreproved, 

I hold, with pardonable pride, 

The place that Johnson occupied. 


Conceit! Presumption! What is this? 
You surely read my words amiss ; 
Like Johnson I, —a man of mind! 
How could you ever be so blind?

MY CORN-COB PIPE. 


EN may sing of their Havanas, elevating 

to the stars 

The real or fancied virtues of their foreign-made 
cigars ; 

But I worship Nicotina at a different sort of 
shrine, 

And she sits enthroned in glory in this corn-cob 
pipe of mine. 


It’s as fragrant as the meadows when the clover 
is in bloom ; 
It’s as dainty as the essence of the daintiest 


perfume ; 
It’s as sweet as are the orchards when the fruit, 
is hanging ripe, 
With the sun’s warm kiss upon them —; 


corn-cob pipe. 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Thro’ the smoke about it clinging, I delight its 
form to trace, 

Like an oriental beauty with a veil upon her 
face ; 

And my room is dim with vapour as a church 
when censers sway, 

As I clasp it to my bosom — in a figurative way. 


It consoles me in misfortune and it cheers me 
in distress, 


And it proves a warm partaker of my pleasures 
in success ; 

So I hail it as a symbol, friendship’s true and 
worthy type, 

And I press my lips devoutly to my corn-cob 
pipe. 


In August. 


IN AUGUST. 


HEN August days are hot an’ dry, 
When burning copper is the sky, 
I’d rather fish than feast or fly 
In airy realms serene and high. 


I’d take a suit not made for looks, 

Some easily digested books, 

Some flies, some lines, some bait, some hooks, 
Then would I seek the bays and brooks. 


I would eschew mine every task, 

In Nature’s smiles my soul should bask, 
And I methinks no more could ask,, 
Except — perhaps — one little flask. 


In case of accident, you know, 
Or should the wind come on to blow, 
Or I be chilled or capsized, so, 
A flask would be the only go. 
125 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Then could I spend a happy time, — 
A bit of sport, a bit of rhyme — 

(A bit of lemon, or of lime, 

To make my bottle’s contents prime), 


When August days are hot an’ dry, 
I won’t sit by an’ sigh or die, 

I'll get my bottle (on the sly) 
And go ahead, and fish, and lie!

H, what shall I do? I am wholly upset ; 

I am sure I'll be jailed for a lunatic yet. 
I’ll be out of a job— it’s the thing to expect 
When I’m letting my duty go by with neglect. 
You may judge the extent and degree of my 

plight 
When I’m thinking all day and a-dreaming all 

night, 
And a-trying my hand at a rhyme on the sly, 
All on account of a sparkling eye. 


There are those who say men should be strong, 
well-a-day ! 

But what constitutes strength in a man? Who 
shall say ? 

I am strong as the most when it comes to the — 
arm. 

I have aye held my own on the playground or 

farm. 
127 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


And when I’ve been tempted, I haven’t been 
weak ; 

But now — why, I tremble to hear a maid speak, 

I used to be bold, but now I’ve grown shy, 

And all on account of a sparkling eye. 


There once was a time when my heart was 
devout, 

But now my religion is open to doubt. 

When parson is earnestly preaching of grace, 

My fancy is busy with drawing a face, 

Thro’ the back of a bonnet most piously plain ; 

‘I draw it, redraw it, and draw it again.’ 

While the songs and the sermon unheeded go 
by, — 

All on account of a sparkling eye, 


Oh, dear little conjurer, give o’er your wiles, 
It is easy for you, you’re all blushes and 
smiles ; 
But, love of my heart, I am sorely perplexed ; 
I am smiling one minute and sighing the next ; 
128 


The Disturber. 


And if it goes on, I’ll drop hackle and flail, 

And go to the parson and tell him my tale. 

I warrant he ’ll find me a cure for the sigh 

That you’re aye bringing forth with the glance 
of your eye. 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


EXPECTATION. 


OU ’LL be wonderin’ whut’s de reason 
I’s a grinnin’ all de time, 

An’ I guess you t’ink my sperits 

_Mus’ be feelin’ mighty prime. 
Well, I ’fess up, I is tickled 

As a puppy at his paws. 
But you need n’t think I’s crazy, 

I ain’ laffin’ ’dout a cause. 


You’s a wonderin’ too, I reckon, 
Why I does n’t seem to eat, 
An’ I notice you a lookin’ 
Lak you felt completely beat 
When I ’fuse to tek de bacon, 
An’ don’ settle on de ham. 
Don’ you feel no feah erbout me, ~ 
Jes’ keep eatin’, an’ be ca’m. 


Fw’ I’s waitin’ an’ I’s watchin’ 
"Bout a little t’ing I see —

Expectation. 


D’ othah night I’s out a walkin’ 
An’ I passed a ’simmon tree. 

Now I’s whettin’ up my hongry, 
An’ I’s laffin’ fit to kill, 

Fu’ de fros’ done turned de ’simmons, 
An’ de possum ’s eat his fill. 


He done go’ged hisse’f owdacious, 
An’ he stayin’ by de tree! 

Don’ you know, ol’ Mistah Possum 
Dat you gittin’ fat fu’ me? 

’Tain’t no use to try to ’spute it, 
’Case I knows you’s gittin’ sweet 

Wif dat ’simmon flavoh thoo you, 
So I’s waitin’ fu’ yo’ meat. 


An’ some ebenin’ me an’ Towsah 
Gwine to come an’ mek a call, 
We jes’ drap in onexpected 
Fw’ to shek yo’ han’, dat’s all. 
Oh, I knows dat you’ll be tickled, 
Seems lak I kin see you smile, 
So pu’haps I mought pu’suade you 
Fu’ to visit us a while.

LITTLE BROWN BABY. 


ITTLE brown baby wif spa’klin’ eyes, 
Come to yo’ pappy an’ set on his knee. 
What you been doin’, suh — makin’ san’ pies? 
Look at dat bib— you ’s ez du’ty ez me. 
Look at dat mouf— dat ’s merlasses, I bet ; 
Come hyeah, Maria, an’ wipe off his ban’s. 
Bees gwine to ketch you an’ eat you up yit, 
Bein’ so sticky an sweet — goodness lan’s ! 


Little brown baby wif spa’klin’ eyes, 
Who’s pappy’s darlin’ an’ who’s pappy’s

Who is it all de day nevah once tries 
Fu’ to be cross, er once loses dat smile? 
Whah did you git dem teef? My, you’s a

Whah did dat dimple come f’om in yo’ chin? 
Pappy do’ know yo—I b’lieves you’s a tramp ; 
Mammy, dis hyeah’s some ol’ straggler

Let ’s th’ow him outen de do’ in de san’, 
We do’ want stragglers a-layin’ ’roun’ hyeah ;

Buggah-man, buggah-man, come in de do’, 
Hyeah’s a bad boy you kin have fu’ to eat. 
Manimy an’ pappy do’ want him no mo’, 
Swaller him down fom his haid to his feet ! 


Dah, now, I t’ought dat you ’d hug me up close. 
Go back, ol’ buggah, you sha’n’t have dis 
boy. 
He ain’t no tramp, ner no Straggler, of co’se ; 
He’s pappy’s pa’dner an’ playmate an’ joy. 
Come to you’ pallet now — go to yo’ res’; 
Wisht you could allus know ease an’ cleah

Wisht you could stay jes’ a chile on my breas’ — 
Little brown baby wif spa’klin’ eyes !

But hit ain’t de crops you’s aftah ; 
You knows w’en de rain comes down 
Dat’s hit ’s too wet out fu’ wo’kin’, 
An’ dey ’s time to tinker ’roun’, 


Oh, dey’s fun inside de co’n-crib,

An’ dey’s allus some one jokin’, 
Er some one to tell a ya’n. 

Dah’s a quiet in yo’ cabin, 
Only fu’ de rain’s sof soun’ : 

So you’s mighty blessed happy

THE REAL QUESTION. 


OLKS is talkin’ ’bout de money, ’bout de 

silvah an’ de gold ; 

All de time’ de season ’s changin’ an’ de days is 
gittin’ cold. 

An’ dey ’s wond’rin’ ’bout de metals, whethah 
we ’ll have one er two. 

While de price 0’ coal is risin’ an’ dey’s two 
months’ rent dat ’s due. 


Some folks says dat gold’s de only money dat is 
wuff de name, 

Den de othahs rise an’ tell ’em dat dey ought 
to be ashame, 

An’ dat silvah is de only thing to save us fom 
de powah 

Of de gold-bug ragin’ ’roun’ an’ seekin’ who he 
may devowah.

But I tell you people hams is sceerce an’ fowls

An’ hit ain’t de so’t o’ money dat is pesterin’

But de question I want answehed ’s how to get

You jes’ bettah tek a hint an’ git yo’self clean

Case de time is mighty temptin’ when de chune

Fu’ a darky, saint or sinner man, to cut de

An’ you could n’t he’p f’om dancin’ ef yo’ feet

When Angelina Johnson comes a-swingin’ down

An’ dat one ol’ squeaky fiddle soun’ to you jes’

Lawd, dey say, 

Gwine to purnish us fu’ steppin’ w’en we hyeah

But I tell you I don’ b’lieve it, fu’ de Lawd is

FOOLIN’ WID DE SEASONS. 


EEMS lak folks is mighty curus 
In de way dey t’inks an’ ac’s, 
Dey jes’ spen’s dey days a-mixin’ 
Up de t’ings in almanacs. 
Now, I min’ my nex’ do’ neighbour, — 
He’s a mighty likely man, 
But he nevah t’inks o’ nuffin 
’Ceptin’ jes’ to plot an’ plan. 


All de wintah he was plannin’ 

How he’d gethah sassafras 
Jes’ ez soon ez evah Springtime 

Put some greenness in de grass, 
An’ he ’lowed a little soonah 

He could stan’ a coolah breeze 
So ’s to mek a little money 

F’om de sugah-watah trees, 

156 


Foolin’ wid de Seasons. 


In de summah, he’d be waihin’ 
Out de linin’ of his soul, 
Try ’n’ to ca’ci’late an’ fashion 
How he’d git his wintah coal ; 
An’ I b’lieve he got his jedgement 
Jes’ so tuckahed out an’ thinned 
Dat he t’ought a robin’s whistle 
Was de whistle of de wind. 


Why won’t folks gin up dey plannin’, 
An’ jes’ be content to know 
Dat dey’s gittin’ all dat’s fu’ dem 
In de days dat come an’ go? 
Why won’t folks quit movin’ forrard ? 
Ain’t hit bettah jes’ to stan’ 
An’ be satisfied wid livin’ 
In de season dat’s at han’? 


Hit ’s enough fu’ me to listen 
W’en de birds is singin’ ’roun’, 
’Dout a-guessin’ whut ’ll happen 
W’en de snow is on de groun’.

But de questun dat has riz 
An’ made lots o’ people diffah

My Sort o’ Man. 


MY SORT O’ MAN. 


DON’T believe in ’ristercrats 
An’ never did, you see ; 
The plain ol’ homelike sorter folks 
Is good enough fur me. 
O’ course, I don’t desire a man 
To be too tarnal rough, 
But then, I think all folks should know 
When they air nice enough. 


Now there is folks in this here world, 
From peasant up to king, 
Who want to be so awful nice 
They overdo the thing. 
That ’s jest the thing that makes me sick, 
An’ quicker ’n a wink 
IT set it down that them same folks 
Ain’t half so good’s you think. 
159 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


I like to see a man dress nice, 
In clothes becomin’ too ; 
I like to see a woman fix 
As women orter to do; 
An’ boys an’ gals I like to see 
Look fresh an’ young an’ spry,— 
We all must have our vanity 
An’ pride before we die. 


But I jedge no man by his clothes, — 
Nor gentleman nor tramp ; 

The man that wears the finest suit 
May be the biggest scamp, 

An’ he whose limbs air clad in rags 
That make a mournful sight, 

In life’s great battle may have proved 
A hero in the fight. 


I don’t believe in ’ristercrats ; 
I like the honest tan 
That lies upon the heathful cheek 
An’ speaks the honest man ; 
166 


My Sort o’ Man. 


I like to grasp the brawny hand 
That labor’s lips have kissed, 
For he who has not labored here 
Life’s greatest pride has missed : 


The pride to feel that yore own strength 
Has cleaved fur you the way 

To heights to which you were not born, 
But struggled day by day. 

What though the thousands sneer an’ scoff, 
An’ scorn yore humble birth? 

Kings are but puppets ; you are king 
By right o’ royal worth. 


The man who simply sits an’ waits 
Fur good to come along, 
Ain’t worth the breath that one would take 
To tell him he is wrong. 
Fur good ain’t flowin’ round this world 
Fur every fool to sup; 
You ’ve got to put yore see-ers on, 
An’ go an’ hunt it up. 
1 161 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Good goes with honesty, I say, 
To honour an’ to bless ; 
To rich an’ poor alike it brings 
A wealth o’ happiness. 
The ’ristercrats ain’t got it all, 
Fur much to their su’prise, 
That’s one of earth’s most blessed things 
They can’t monopolize.

Hit ’s to see some ign’ant white man 

Mittin’ dat owdacious sin — 
W’en he want to cook a possum 

Tekin’ off de possum’s skin. 


W’y, dey ain’t no use in talkin’, 
Hit jes’ hu’ts me to de hea’t 
Fu’ to see dem foolish people 
Th’owin’ ’way de fines’ pa’t. 
W’y, dat skin is jes’ ez tendah 
An’ ez juicy ez kin be ; 
I knows all erbout de critter — 
Hide an’ haih — don’t talk to me!

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Possum skin is jes lak shoat skin ; 
Jes’ you swinge an’ scrope it down, 
Tek a good sha’p knife an’ sco’ it, 
Den you bake it good an’ brown. 
Huh-uh! honey, you’s so happy 
Dat yo’ thoughts is ’mos’ a sin 
When you’s settin’ dah a-chawin’ 
On dat possum’s cracklin’ skin. 


White folks t’ink dey know ’bout eatin’, 
An’ I reckon dat dey do 
Sometimes git a little idee 
Of a middlin’ dish er two ; 
But dey ain’t a t’ing dey knows of 
Dat I reckon cain’t be beat 
W’en we set down at de table 
To a unskun possum’s meat !

AY me down beneaf de willers in de grass, 
Whah de branch ’ll go a-singin’ as it pass. 
An’ w’en I’s a-layin’ low,

Singin’, “Sleep, my honey, tek yo’ res’ at las’.” 


Lay me nigh to whah hit meks a little pool, 
An’ de watah stan’s so quiet lak an’ cool, 
Whah de little birds in spring, 
Ust to come an’ drink an’ sing, 
An’ de chillen waded on dey way to school. 


Let me settle w’en my shouldahs draps dey load 
Nigh enough to hyeah de noises in de road ; 
Fu’ I tink de las’ long res’ 
Gwine to soothe my sperrit bes’ 
Ef I’s layin’ ’mong de t’ings I’s allus knowed.

Fw’ to dance er do jes’ whut we wants to do. 
An’ dey ain’t no ovahseer an’ no othah kind 0’

So de little pigs is feelin’ kind o’ shy. 
De chickens ain’t so trus’ful ez dey was, to say

An’ de wise ol’ hens is roostin’ mighty high. 
You could n’t git a gobblah fu’ to look you in de

But hit’s mighty dange’ous trav’lin’ fu’ de

F’om de time dat log commence a bu’nin’

Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


POSSUM TROT. 


35 journeyed ’roun’ consid’able, a-seein’ 
men an’ things, 

An’ I’ve learned a little of the sense that meetin’ 
people brings ; 

But in spite of all my travellin’, an’ of all I think 
I know, 

I’ve got one notion in my head, that I can’t git 
to go; 

An’ it is that the folks I meet in any other spot 

Ain’t half so good as them I knowed back home 
in Possum Trot. 


I know you ’ve never heerd the name, it ain’t a 
famous place, 

An’ I reckon ef you'd search the map you could 
n’t find a trace 

Of any sich locality as this I’ve named to you; 

But never mind, I know the place, an’ I love it 
dearly too. 

182 


Possum Trot. 


It don’t make no pretensions to bein’ great or 
fine, 

The circuses don’t come that way, they ain’t no 
railroad line. 

It ain’t no great big city, where the schemers 
plan an’ plot, 

But jest a little settlement, this place called 
Possum Trot. e 


But don’t you think the folks that lived in that 
outlandish place 

Were ignorant of all the things that go for sense 
or grace. 

Why, there was Hannah Dyer, you may search 
this teemin’ earth 

An’ never find a sweeter girl, er one 0’ greater 
worth ; 

An’ Uncle Abner Williams, a-leanin’ on his staff, 

It seems like I kin hear him talk, an’ hear his 
hearty laugh. 

His heart was big an’ cheery as a sunny acre lot, 

Why, that ’s the kind o’ folks we had down there 
at Possum Trot. 

183 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


Good times? Well, now, to suit my taste, — 
an’ I’m some hard to suit, — 

There ain’t been no sich pleasure sence, an’ 
won’t be none to boot, 

With huskin’ bees in Harvest time, an’ dances 
later on, 

An’ singin’ school, an taffy pulls, an’ fun from 
night till dawn. 

Revivals come in winter time, baptizin’s in the 
spring, 

You ’d ought to seen those people shout, an’ 
heerd ’em pray an’ sing; 

You ’d ought to’ve heard ole Parson Brown 
a-throwin’ gospel shot 

Among the saints an’ sinners in the days of 
Possum Trot. 


We live up in the city now, my wife was bound 
to come ; 
I hear aroun’ me day by day the endless stir 
an’ hum. 
I reckon that it done me good, an’ yet it done 
me harm, 
184 


Possum Trot. 


That oil was found so plentiful down there on 
my ole farm. 

We ’ve got a new-styled preacher, our church is 
new-styled too, 

An’ I’ve come down from what I knowed to 
rent a cushioned pew. 

But often when I’m settin’ there, it’s foolish, 
like as not, 

To think of them ol’ benches in the church at 
Possum Trot. 


I know that I’m ungrateful, an’ sich thoughts 
must be a sin, 

But I find myself a wishin’ that the times was 
back agin. 

With the huskin’s an’ the frolics, an’ the joys I 
used to know, 

When I lived at the settlement, a dozen years 
ago. 

I don’t feel this way often, I’m scarcely ever 
glum, 

For life has taught me how to take her chances 
as they come. 


185 


Lyrics of the Hearthside. 


But now an’ then my mind goes back to that _ 
ol’ buryin’ plot, 
That holds the dust of some I loved, down there _ j 
at Possum Trot.

BREAKING THE CHARM. 


AUGHT Susanner whistlin’; well, 
It’s most nigh too good to tell. 
’Twould ’a’ b’en too good to see 
Ef it had n’t b’en fur me, 
Comin’ up so soft an’ sly 
That she didn’ hear me nigh. 
I was pokin’ ’round that day, 
An’ ez I come down the way, 
First her whistle strikes my ears, — 
Then her gingham dress appears ; 
So with soft step up I slips. 
Oh, them dewy, rosy lips ! 
Ripe ez cherries, red an’ round, 
Puckered up to make the sound. 
She was lookin’ in the spring, 
Whistlin’ to beat anything, — 


.“ Kitty Dale” er “In the Sweet.” 


I was jest so mortal beat 
190 


Breaking the Charm. 


That I can’t quite ricoleck 

What the toon was, but I ’speck 

’T was some hymn er other, fur 

Hymny things is jest like her. 

Well she went on fur awhile 

With her face all in a smile, 

An’ I never moved, but stood 

Stiller ’n a piece o’ wood — 

Would n’t wink ner would n’t stir, 

But a-gazin’ right at her, 

Tell she turns an’ sees me — my! 

Thought at first she ’d try to fly. 

But she blushed an’ stood her ground. 

Then, a-slyly lookin’ round, 

She says: “Did you hear me, Ben?’”’ 

“ Whistlin’ woman, crowin’ hen,” 

Says I, lookin’ awful stern. 

Then the red commenced to burn 

In them cheeks o’ hern. Why, la! 

Reddest red you ever saw — 

Pineys wa’n’t a circumstance. 

You’d ’a’ noticed in a glance 

She was pow’rful shamed an’ skeart ; 
191 


Lyrics of the Hearthaic, 


But she looked so sweet an’ peart, 
That a idee struck my head ; 

So I up an’ slowly said: 

“Woman whistlin’ brings shore harm, 
Jest one thing ’ll break the charm.” 


“And what ’s that?’”? «Oh my!” says I, 


“T don’t like to tell you.” . “Why?” 
Says Susanner. “ Well, you see 
It would kinder fall on me.” 
Course I knowed that she ’d insist, — 
So I says: “You must be kissed 
By the man that heard you whistle ; 
Everybody says that this ’ll 
Break the charm and set you free 
From the threat’nin’ penalty.” 
She was blushin’ fit to kill, 
But she answered, kinder still : 
“T don’t want to have no harm, 
Please come, Ben, an’ break the charm.” 
Did I break that charm? — oh, well, 
There ’s some things I must n’t tell. 
I remember, afterwhile, 
Her a-sayin’ with a smile:

“ Oh, you quit, — you sassy dunce, 
You jest caught me whistlin’ once.” 
Ev’ry sence that when I hear 
Some one whistlin’ kinder clear, 

I most break my neck to see 

Ef it’s Susy ; but, dear me, 

I jest find I’ve b’en to chase 
Some blamed boy about the place. 
Dad’s b’en noticin’ my way, 

An’ last night I heerd him say : 
“We must send fur Dr. Glenn, 
Mother; somethin’s wrong with Ben!”

Blow it twell de back’ard breeze

Watch him now— steady, — min’ — what you’s

Bless me, dat animal ’s got on de trail!

An’ I nevah seed him fail 
W’en he sot dem flappin’ eahs 
An’ went off upon a trail.

An’ a long hunt gins a good appetite.

I’s right well, I’s glad to tell you (dough dis

An’ I hopes w’en dese lines reach you, dat dey ’ll

If you want to see de billers, you jes’ view dem 
fom de lan’.) 

"Bout de people? We been t’inkin’ dat all 
white folks was alak ; 

But dese Englishmen is diffunt, an’ dey’s curus 
fu’ a fac’. 

Fust, dey ’s heavier an’ redder in dey make-up 
an’ dey looks, 

An’ dey don’t put salt"nor pepper in a blessed 
ting dey cooks! 

W’en dey gin you good ol’ tu’nips, ca’ots, pa’s- 
nips, beets, an’ sich, 

Ef dey ain’t some one to tell you, you cain’t 
’stinguish which is which. 

W’en I t’ought I’se eatin’ chicken — you may 
b’lieve dis hyeah’s a lie — 

But de waiter beat me down dat I was eatin’ 
rabbit pie. 

An’ dey 'd t’ink dat you was crazy — jes’ a reg’- 
lar ravin’ loon, 

Ef you’d speak erbout a ’possum or a piece o’ 
good ol’ coon. 

O, hit ’s mighty nice, dis trav’lin’, an’ I’s kin’ o 
glad I come.

I done see de Crystal Palace, an’ I’s hyeahd

But I has n’t seén no banjos layin’ nowhahs

Jes’ gin ol’ Jim Bowles a banjo, an’ he’d not go

’Fo’ he ’d outplayed all dese fiddlers, wif dey 
flourish and dey stir. 

Evahbiddy dat I’s met wif has been monst’ous

But I t’ink I’d lak it better to be down in Jones’s

Where we ust to have sich frolics, Lucy, you an’

Dough my appetite ’ud call me, ef dey wasn’t 
nuffin else. 

Id jes’ lak to have some sweet-pertaters roasted

Well, I reckon, I mus’ close now; write ez soon

Tell de folks I sen’ ’em howdy; gin a kiss to

High-tone boys meks high-tone men. 


Once dey was a ole black bah, 
Used to live ’roun’ hyeah somewhah 
In acave. He was so big © 
He could ca’y off a pig 
Lak you picks a chicken up, 

Er yo’ leetles’ bit o’ pup. 
An’ he had two gread big eyes, 
Jes’ erbout a saucer’s size. 
Why, dey looked lak balls o’ fiah 
Jumpin’ ’roun’ erpon a wiah 
W’en dat bah was mad ; an’ laws! 
But you ought to seen his paws ! 
Did Isee em? How you ’spec

Dis hyeah ya’n I’s try’n’ to spin 
Ef you keeps on puttin’ in? 
You keep still an’ don’t you cheep

Dis hyeah bah’d go trompin’ ’roun’ 
Eatin’ evahthing he foun’ ; 

No one could n’t have a fa’m 

But dat bah ’u’d do ’em ha’m ; 
And dey could n’t ketch de scamp. 
Anywhah he wan’ed to tramp, 

Dah de scoun’el ’d mek his track, 
Do his du’t an’ come on back, 

He was sich a sly ole limb, 

Traps was jes’ lak fun to him. 


Now, down neah whah Mistah Bah 
Lived, dey was a weasel dah ; 
But dey was n’t fren’s a-tall 
Case de weasel was so small. 

An’ de bah ’u’d, jes’ fu’ sass, 
Tu’n his nose up w’en he ’d pass. 
Weasels ’s small 0’ cose, but my! 
Dem air animiles is sly. 
So dis hyeah one says, says he, 
“Tl jes’ fix dat bah, you see,” 
So he fixes up his plan 
An’ hunts up de fa’merman,

When de fa’mer see him come, 

He ’mence lookin’ mighty glum, 

An’ he ketches up a stick ; 

But de weasel speak up quick: 

“ Hol’ on, Mistah Fa’mer man, 

I wan’ ’splain a little plan. 

Ef you waits, I ’ll tell you whah 

An’ jes’ how to ketch ol’ Bah. 

But I tell yow now you mus’ 

Gin me one fat chicken fus’.” 

Den de man he scratch his haid, 

Las’ he say, “ I’ll mek de trade.” 

So de weasel et his hen, 

Smacked his mouf and says, “ Well, den, 

Set yo’ trap an’ bait ternight, 

An’ I’ll ketch de bah all right.” 

Den he ups an’ goes to see 

Mistah Bah, an’ says, says he: 

“Well, fren’ Bah, we aiz’t been fren’s, 

But ternight ha’d feelin’ ’en’s. 

Ef you ain’t too proud to steal, 

We kin git a splendid meal. 

Cose I would n’t come to you,

Well, dey trots erlong ontwell 
Dat air meat beginned to smell 
In de trap. Den weasel say: 
“Now you put yo’ paw dis way 
While I hol’ de spring back so, 
Den you grab de meat an’ go.” 
Well, de bah he had to grin 
Ez he put his big paw in, 
Den he juked up, but — kerbing ! 
Weasel done let go de spring. 
“Dah now,” says de weasel, “« dah, 
I done cotched you, Mistah Bah!” 
O, dat bah did sno’t and spout, 
Try’n’ his bestes’ to git out, 
But de weasel say, “ Goo’-bye ! 
Weasel small, but weasel sly.” 
Den he tu’ned his back an’ run 
Tol’ de fa’mer whut he done.

It’s amazin’ nice to fin’ my suppah all erpon de

An’ it’s nice to smell de coffee bubblin’ ovah in

An’ it’s fine to see de meat a-sizzlin’ teasin’-

But when suppah-time is ovah, an’ de t’ings is

Den de happy hours dat foller are de sweetes’

When my co’ncob pipe is sta’ted, an’ de smoke

My ole ’ooman says, “I reckon, Ike, it’s can-
